Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer read from standard input, 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n vertices.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will continue to execute until `R - L <= 1`. At this point, `L` and `R` will be adjacent integers, and the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The final values of `L` and `R` will depend on the conditions evaluated in each iteration, but they will be such that `R - L <= 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
