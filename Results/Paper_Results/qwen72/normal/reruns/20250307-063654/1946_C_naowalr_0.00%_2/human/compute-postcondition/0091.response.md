Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the new value read from the input, `k` is the new value read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` is 0, `R - L` is 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `t` must be greater than `z`.**
