The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range object `range(n - 1)`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range in the for loop.

State: **`t` is an integer read from standard input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer read from the next line of standard input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer read from the next line of standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0**
