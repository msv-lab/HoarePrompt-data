Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`.
- Given `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the expression `(1 + 100001) // 2` evaluates to `50001`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged.
