To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` is the same as the initial `n`.
   - `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input.
   - `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input.
   - `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.
   - `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `R - L` is 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `L` and `R` are defined based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`.
   - `numCuts` is 0, which means the conditions for `L` and `R` are based on the initial state where no cuts have been made.
   - `R - L` is 1, indicating that `R` is exactly one more than `L`.

3. **Determine `L` and `R`:**
   - Since `numCuts` is 0, the condition for `L` is that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.
   - The condition for `R` is that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).
   - Given `R - L` is 1, `L` must be the largest value that satisfies the condition for `L`, and `R` must be the smallest value that satisfies the condition for `R`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `numCuts` is 0, `L` is the maximum value such that `0 <= k` and `leftover < x`.
   - `R` is the minimum value such that `0 > k` or (`0 == k` and `leftover >= x`).
   - Given `R - L` is 1, `L` must be the value just below `R`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`, which is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.

Output: **L (where L is the maximum value such that numCuts is less than or equal to k and leftover is less than x)**
