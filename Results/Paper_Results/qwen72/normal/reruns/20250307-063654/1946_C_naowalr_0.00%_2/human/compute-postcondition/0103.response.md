Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `a` has been appended to `adj[b]`.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` remains 2, `n` is still greater than 3, `a` and `b` are still the input integers, `adj[a]` still contains `b` as an additional element, and `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, with `a` having been appended to `adj[b]`.
