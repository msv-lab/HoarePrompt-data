The code initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.**
