The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. This impacts the value of `leftover`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are modified within the `dfs` function, which is not shown in the provided code.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input
- `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input
- `x` is `(L + R) // 2`
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`
- `numCuts` is 0
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`
- If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001

The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `x`, `L`, `R`, or `numCuts`. It only updates the value of `leftover` to the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.**
