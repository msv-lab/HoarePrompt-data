The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**
