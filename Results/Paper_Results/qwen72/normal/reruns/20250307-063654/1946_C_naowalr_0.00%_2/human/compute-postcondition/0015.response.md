Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`.
- After the code execution, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input, but their specific values are not provided.
