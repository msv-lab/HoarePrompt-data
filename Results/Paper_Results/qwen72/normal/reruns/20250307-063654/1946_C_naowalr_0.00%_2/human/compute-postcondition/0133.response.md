Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, `n`, `k`, and `adj` are the same as their initial values for that iteration. `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all `t` iterations, the following conditions hold true:

- The loop has executed exactly `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from standard input at the beginning.
- For each of the `t` iterations, the values of `n`, `k`, and `adj` are the same as they were when the loop started for that particular iteration. This means that `n` and `k` are the positive integers read from the input, and `adj` is the adjacency list constructed from the input pairs of vertices.
- The variable `L` holds the largest integer value such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`. This value is determined by the binary search within the loop.
- The variable `R` is always `L + 1` at the end of each iteration, ensuring that `R - L` is exactly 1.
- The final output for each iteration is the value of `L`, which represents the maximum number of cuts that can be made to satisfy the given conditions.

The state of other variables like `a`, `b`, and `i` remains unchanged for each iteration, as they are reset or re-assigned within the loop. The variables `L` and `R` are the only ones that are modified in a way that affects the final output of the loop.
