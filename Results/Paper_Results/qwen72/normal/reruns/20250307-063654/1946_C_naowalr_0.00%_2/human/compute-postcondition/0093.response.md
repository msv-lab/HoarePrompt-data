The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
