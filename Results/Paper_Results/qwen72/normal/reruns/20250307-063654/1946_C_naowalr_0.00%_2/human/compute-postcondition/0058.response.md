Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended again), and `b` is appended to `adj[a]` again.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but the code has appended `b` to the list `adj[a]` again, so `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements, and `b` appears one more time in the list. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
