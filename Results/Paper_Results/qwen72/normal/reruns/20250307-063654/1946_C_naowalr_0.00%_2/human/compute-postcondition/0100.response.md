The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2, but now `n - 1` must be greater than 2, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `a` has been appended to `adj[b]`**
