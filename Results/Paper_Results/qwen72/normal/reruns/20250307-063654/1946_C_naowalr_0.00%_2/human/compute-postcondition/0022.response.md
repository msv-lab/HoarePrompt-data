Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` explicitly sets the variable `numCuts` to 0, which matches the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `numCuts` is now explicitly set to 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
