Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `z` remains 0.
- The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 1, as it was initially.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The `adj` list now contains `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `a` (for all `a` values read from input) contains the corresponding `b` values, and each list at index `b` (for all `b` values read from input) contains the corresponding `a` values.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` hold the last pair of integers read from input during the final iteration of the loop.
