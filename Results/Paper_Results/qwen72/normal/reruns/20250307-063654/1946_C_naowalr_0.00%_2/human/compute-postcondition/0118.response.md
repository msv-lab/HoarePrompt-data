Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
