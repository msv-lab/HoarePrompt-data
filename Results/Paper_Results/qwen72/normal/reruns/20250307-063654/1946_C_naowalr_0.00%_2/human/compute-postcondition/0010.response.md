Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

Explanation:
- `adj[a]` initially contains `[b]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `adj[b]`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged or retain their updated values as specified in the initial state.
