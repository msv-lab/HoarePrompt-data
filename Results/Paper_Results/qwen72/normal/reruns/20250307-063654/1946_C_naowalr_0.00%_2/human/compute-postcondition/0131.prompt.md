Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `numCuts` is not equal to `k` or `leftover` is less than `x`, then `L` is `(L + R) // 2` and `R` is 50001. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
