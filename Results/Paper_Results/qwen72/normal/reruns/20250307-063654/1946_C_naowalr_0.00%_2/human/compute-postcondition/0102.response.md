Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `b` has been appended to `adj[a]`.**

The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Therefore, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
