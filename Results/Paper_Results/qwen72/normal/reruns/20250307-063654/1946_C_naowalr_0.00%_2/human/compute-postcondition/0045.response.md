The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `z` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0 and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `z`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`**
