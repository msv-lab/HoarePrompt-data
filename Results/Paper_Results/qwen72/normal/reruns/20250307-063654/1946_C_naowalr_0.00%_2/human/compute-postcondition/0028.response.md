Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `x` is 50000, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is 50000 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` <= `k` and (`numCuts` < `k` or `leftover` < `x`), then `L` is 1 and `R` is 50000.***
