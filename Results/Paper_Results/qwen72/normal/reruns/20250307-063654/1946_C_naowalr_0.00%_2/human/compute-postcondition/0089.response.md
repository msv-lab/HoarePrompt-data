The only objects in the loop head are the variables `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `z` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than `z`.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` is 0, `R - L` is 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `t` must be greater than `z`**
