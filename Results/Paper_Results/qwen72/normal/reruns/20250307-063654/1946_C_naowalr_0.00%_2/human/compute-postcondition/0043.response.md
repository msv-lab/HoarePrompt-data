Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. The loop is a binary search that adjusts the values of `L` and `R` based on the number of cuts `numCuts` and the leftover value from the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.

- **`L`**: This variable will be the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`R`**: This variable will be `L + 1`, as the loop exits when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1.

The loop effectively narrows down the range `[L, R]` to a point where `L` is the optimal value that satisfies the conditions of the problem, and `R` is the next integer after `L`.
