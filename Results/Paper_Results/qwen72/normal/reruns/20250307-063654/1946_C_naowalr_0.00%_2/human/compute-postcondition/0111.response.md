Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**. 

The `dfs` function is called with arguments `1` and `1`, and the result of this function call is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
