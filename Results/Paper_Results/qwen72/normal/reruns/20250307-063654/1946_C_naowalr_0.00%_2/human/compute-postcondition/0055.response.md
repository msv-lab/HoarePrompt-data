Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended again).**

The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements, and `adj[a]` still contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again). The values of `i` and `n` remain the same.
