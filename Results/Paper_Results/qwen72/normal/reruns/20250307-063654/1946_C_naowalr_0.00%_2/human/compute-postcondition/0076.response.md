Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` updates the value of `leftover` to the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `x`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `L` and `R` based on `numCuts` and `leftover` is still valid but has not been evaluated yet, so it remains in the output state as a condition.
