Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `numCuts` is not equal to `k` or `leftover` is less than `x`, then `L` is `(L + R) // 2` and `R` is 50001. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.***
