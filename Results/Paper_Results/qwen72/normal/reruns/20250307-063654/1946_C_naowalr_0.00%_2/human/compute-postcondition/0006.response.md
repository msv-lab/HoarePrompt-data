Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b]`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `z` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- The value of `k` remains an integer.
- The list `adj` remains a list of `n + 1` empty lists, except that `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b`.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain integers.
