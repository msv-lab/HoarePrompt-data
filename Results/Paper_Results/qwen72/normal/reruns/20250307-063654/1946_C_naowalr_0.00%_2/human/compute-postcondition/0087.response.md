Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is the maximum value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`, `R` is the minimum value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L` is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.
- In each iteration, the variable `x` is set to the midpoint of `L` and `R` (i.e., `(L + R) // 2`).
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function is called, and its return value is stored in `leftover`.
- The variable `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is updated to `x`.
- Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will terminate when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `R - L` is 1.
- At this point, `L` will be the maximum value that satisfies the condition where `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.
- Conversely, `R` will be the minimum value that satisfies the condition where `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).
- The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
