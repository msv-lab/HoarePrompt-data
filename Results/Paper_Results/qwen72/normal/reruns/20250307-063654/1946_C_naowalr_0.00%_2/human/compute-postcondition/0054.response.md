Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.**

The value of `i` remains 1, and `n` is still greater than 1. The integers `a` and `b` are still the values read from the input. The list `adj[a]` now has `b` appended to it again, so `b` is now included in `adj[a]` twice. The list `adj[b]` still contains `a` as one of its elements.
