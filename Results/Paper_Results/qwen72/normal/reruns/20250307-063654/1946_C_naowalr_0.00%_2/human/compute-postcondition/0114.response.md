Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
