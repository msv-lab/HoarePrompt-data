The value of `count[num]` is decremented by 1. Since `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and `num` is in `count`, the initial value of `count[num]` must be at least 1. After the decrement, `count[num]` will be `count[num] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is `count[num] - 1`.**
