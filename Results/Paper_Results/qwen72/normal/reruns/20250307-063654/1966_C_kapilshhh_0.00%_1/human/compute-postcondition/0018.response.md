Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, `tc` is greater than 1 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is the length of the new `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `dp` is `True`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `dp` to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `tc`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `dp` is now explicitly `True`.
