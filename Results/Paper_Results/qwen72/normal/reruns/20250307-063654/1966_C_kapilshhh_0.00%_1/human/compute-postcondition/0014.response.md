Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, `tc` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1] > 1 or not dp`.**

The value of `tc` has been decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
