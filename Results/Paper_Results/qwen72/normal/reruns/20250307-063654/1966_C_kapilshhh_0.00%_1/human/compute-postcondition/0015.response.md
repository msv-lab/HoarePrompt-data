The variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, `tc` is greater than 1 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1] > 1 or not dp`**
