Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`arr`**: A sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0.
2. **`len(arr)`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`i`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
4. **`tc`**: Must be greater than 1.
5. **`n`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
6. **`dp`**: `True` if any of the differences `arr[j] - (arr[j + 1] if j < n else 0)` for `j` from 1 to `n` is greater than 1; otherwise `dp` is `False`.

### Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: Since `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0, the last element of `arr` is 0. For example, if the input integers are [5, 3, 2], then `arr` would be [5, 3, 2, 0].
2. **`len(arr)`**: This is the length of the list `arr`, which is greater than 1.
3. **`i`**: `len(arr) - 1` is the index of the last element in `arr`, which is 0.
4. **`n`**: `len(arr) - 1` is the index of the second-to-last element in `arr`.
5. **`dp`**: We need to check if any difference `arr[j] - (arr[j + 1] if j < n else 0)` for `j` from 1 to `n` is greater than 1.

### Calculation of `dp`:
- For `j` from 1 to `n`:
  - If `j < n`, the difference is `arr[j] - arr[j + 1]`.
  - If `j == n`, the difference is `arr[j] - 0` (since `arr[j + 1]` is out of bounds and we use 0).

Given that `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by 0, the differences between consecutive elements (except the last element which is 0) will be non-negative. The last difference `arr[n] - 0` will be the value of the second-to-last element in `arr`.

### Example:
- If `arr = [5, 3, 2, 0]`:
  - `arr[1] - arr[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
  - `arr[2] - arr[3] = 2 - 0 = 2` (which is greater than 1)
  - Therefore, `dp` will be `True`.

### General Case:
- Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by 0, the last difference `arr[n] - 0` will always be the value of the second-to-last element in `arr`, which is a positive integer.
- This difference will always be greater than 1 if `arr[n]` is greater than 1, which is true because `tc` must be greater than 1 and `len(arr)` is greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
- `dp` will always be `True` because the last difference `arr[n] - 0` is always greater than 1.

### Code Execution:
```
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```
- Since `dp` is `True`, the `print` statement will print 'Alice'.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
