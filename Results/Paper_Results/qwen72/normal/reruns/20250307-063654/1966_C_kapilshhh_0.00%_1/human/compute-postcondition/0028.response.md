The value of `tc` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, `tc` is `tc - 1`.**
