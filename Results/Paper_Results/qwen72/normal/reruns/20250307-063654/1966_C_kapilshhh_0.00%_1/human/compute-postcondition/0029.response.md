The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is `tc - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, `tc` must be greater than 1**
