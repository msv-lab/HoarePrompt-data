Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer in the inner lists is positive and does not exceed 10^9, and the length of each inner list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all inner lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `tc` must be greater than 0. `n` is an input integer.**
