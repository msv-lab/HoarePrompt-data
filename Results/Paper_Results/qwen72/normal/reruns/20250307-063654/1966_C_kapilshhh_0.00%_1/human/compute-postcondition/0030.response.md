Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, `tc` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `i`, `arr`, `len(arr)`, `dp`, and `tc`.
- The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.
