Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the final print statement. It always prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. The correct line should be:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program should check if the number of distinct pile sizes is odd or even to determine the winner. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins. The current implementation does not correctly reflect this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True)
        dp = len(arr) % 2 == 1
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes.
