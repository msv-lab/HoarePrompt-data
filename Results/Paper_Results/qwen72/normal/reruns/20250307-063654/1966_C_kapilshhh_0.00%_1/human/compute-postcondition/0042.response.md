Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `tc` is `tc - 1`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any of the differences `arr[j] - (arr[j + 1] if j < n else 0)` for `j` from 1 to `n` is greater than 1; otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, so `tc` is now `tc - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `arr`, `len(arr)`, `n`, and `dp` remain unchanged.
