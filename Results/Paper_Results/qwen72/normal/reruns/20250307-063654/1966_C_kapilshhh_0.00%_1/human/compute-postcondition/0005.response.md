Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `tc`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.
