Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer in the inner lists is positive and does not exceed 10^9, and the length of each inner list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all inner lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing a set of piles for a test case.
