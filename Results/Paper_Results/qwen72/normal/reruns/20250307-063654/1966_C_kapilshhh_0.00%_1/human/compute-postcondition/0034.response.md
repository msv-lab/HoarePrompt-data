The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, len(arr))`. For the loop to execute, `len(arr)` must be greater than 1, which is already given. However, the initial state of `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is outside the range of the loop (1 to `len(arr) - 1`). Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to start executing correctly.

State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `True`, `tc` must be greater than 1, `n` is `len(arr) - 1**`
