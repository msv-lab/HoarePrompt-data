Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case.
3. `tc` is greater than 0.
4. `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
5. `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0.
6. `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
7. `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1] > 1 or not dp`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`arr` Construction**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input integers are `[5, 3, 7, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[7, 5, 3, 1, 0]`.

2. **`i` Calculation**:
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - If `arr` has 5 elements (as in the example above), then `i` would be `4`.

3. **`dp` Calculation**:
   - `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `len(arr) - 2` is the second-to-last index of `arr`.
   - `len(arr) - 1` is the last index of `arr`, which is always 0.
   - Therefore, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp`.
   - Simplifying, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] > 1 or not dp`.

4. **Initial Value of `dp`**:
   - The initial value of `dp` is not explicitly given in the initial state. However, the expression `dp` is defined in terms of itself, which suggests that `dp` must be initialized to a boolean value (True or False) before this line is executed.

5. **Evaluating `dp`**:
   - If `dp` is initially `True`, then `dp` remains `True` because `arr[len(arr) - 2] > 1` is always `True` (since `arr` is sorted in descending order and contains unique integers, the second-to-last element is always greater than 1).
   - If `dp` is initially `False`, then `dp` becomes `arr[len(arr) - 2] > 1 or not False`, which simplifies to `arr[len(arr) - 2] > 1 or True`, which is always `True`.

### Conclusion:
- Regardless of the initial value of `dp`, the expression `arr[len(arr) - 2] > 1 or not dp` will always evaluate to `True` because `arr[len(arr) - 2]` is always greater than 1.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
