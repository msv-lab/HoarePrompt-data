Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then checks if there is any difference greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of stones (excluding the last 0). If such a difference exists, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice' (which seems to be a mistake, as it always prints 'Alice'). After processing all test cases, `tc` is 0, and the function has printed 'Alice' for each test case. **
