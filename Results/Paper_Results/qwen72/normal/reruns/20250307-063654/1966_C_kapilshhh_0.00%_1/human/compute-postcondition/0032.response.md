Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `True`, `tc` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `dp` has been updated to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
