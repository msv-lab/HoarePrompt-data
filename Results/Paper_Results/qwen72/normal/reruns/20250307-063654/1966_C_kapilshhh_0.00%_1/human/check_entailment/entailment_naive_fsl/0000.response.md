Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in the final print statement. It always prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. This means that even when Bob should win, the program will incorrectly print 'Alice'. Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
1 7
```
Expected Output:
```
Bob
```
Actual Output:
```
Alice
```

The program should print 'Bob' for this test case because Alice can only choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, and then Bob can choose \( k = 6 \) on his turn, emptying all piles and winning the game. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Alice' due to the logical error in the print statement.
