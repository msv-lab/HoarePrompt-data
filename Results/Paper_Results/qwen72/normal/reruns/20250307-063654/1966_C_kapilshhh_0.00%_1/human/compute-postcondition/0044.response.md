The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `piles`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer in the inner lists is positive and does not exceed 10^9, and the length of each inner list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all inner lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the total number of stones is odd, the function returns "Alice" (indicating Alice wins); if the total number of stones is even, the function returns "Bob" (indicating Bob wins).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns a list of results, with "Alice" for each test case where the total number of stones is odd, and "Bob" for each test case where the total number of stones is even.**
