Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, `tc` is greater than 1 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is the length of the new `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- `arr` is updated to a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0.
- `n` is updated to the length of the new `arr` minus 1.
- `i` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `tc`, `dp`, and the input integer `n` remain unchanged.
