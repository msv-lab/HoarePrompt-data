Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, `tc` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]` updates the value of `arr`.
- `arr` is now a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0.
- The value of `i` remains `len(arr) - 1` because `len(arr)` is still greater than 1 after the update.
- The value of `dp` is still `arr[len(arr) - 2] - 0 > 1 or not dp` because `arr` has been updated, but the condition for `dp` is based on the new `arr`.
- The value of `tc` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
