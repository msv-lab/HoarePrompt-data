Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, in descending order, followed by 0, `len(arr)` is greater than 1, `dp` is `True`, `tc` must be greater than 1, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

The value of `n` is updated to be `len(arr) - 1`, which is the same as the initial value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
