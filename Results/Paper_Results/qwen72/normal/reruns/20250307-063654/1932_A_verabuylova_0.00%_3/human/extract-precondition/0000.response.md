Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the expected parameters based on the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the precondition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and the path string.
