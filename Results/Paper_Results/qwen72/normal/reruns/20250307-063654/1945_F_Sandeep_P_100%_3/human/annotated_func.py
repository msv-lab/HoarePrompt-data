#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir of maximum strength. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. However, since this function is not directly involved in solving the problem, it does not have the necessary parameters related to the problem's context.

Given the problem and the function, the function signature does not contain any variables related to the problem (such as `n`, `v`, `p`, etc.). Therefore, it is not possible to extract a precondition that is relevant to the problem from this function.

If you intended to provide a different function that is actually part of the solution to the problem, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition for you.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function`. This `decorating_function` is intended to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of another function, specifically to return `fillvalue` for recursive calls.
