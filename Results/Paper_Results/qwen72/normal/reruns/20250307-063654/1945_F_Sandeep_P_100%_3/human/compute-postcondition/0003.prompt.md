You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir of maximum strength. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. However, since this function is not directly involved in solving the problem, it does not have the necessary parameters related to the problem's context.

Given the problem and the function, the function signature does not contain any variables related to the problem (such as `n`, `v`, `p`, etc.). Therefore, it is not possible to extract a precondition that is relevant to the problem from this function.

If you intended to provide a different function that is actually part of the solution to the problem, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition for you.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function` that can be used to modify the behavior of another function to return `fillvalue` for recursive calls.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `decorating_function`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
