The provided code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function, which does not execute any operations that change the state of variables. Since the initial state does not include any variables or specific values, and the code snippet itself does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir of maximum strength. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls.**
