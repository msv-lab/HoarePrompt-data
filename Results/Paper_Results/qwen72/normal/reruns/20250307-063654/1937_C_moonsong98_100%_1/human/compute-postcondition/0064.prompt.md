Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<' or '=', `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.
Code of the loop:
for i in min_indices:
    if i == max_index:
        continue
    res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
    if res == '=':
        min_index = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, n-1)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is the next element in `min_indices` after `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `n-1`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is the next element in `min_indices` after the previous `i`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is updated to the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `i`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. `min_indices` must have at least one more element after the current `i` for the loop to execute again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
