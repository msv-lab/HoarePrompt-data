Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and is '=', `min_indices` is a list containing the values of `max_index` and `0`.**

The value `0` (which is the current value of `i`) is appended to the list `min_indices`. The other variables remain unchanged.
