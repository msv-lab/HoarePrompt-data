Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 1)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `min_indices = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `min_indices`.
- Since `i` is 1, `min_indices` is now `[1]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `max_index`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `min_indices` is updated to reflect that it now contains the value 1.
