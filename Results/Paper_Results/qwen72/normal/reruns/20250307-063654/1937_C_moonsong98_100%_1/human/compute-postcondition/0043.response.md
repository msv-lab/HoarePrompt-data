Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<' or '=', `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.**
