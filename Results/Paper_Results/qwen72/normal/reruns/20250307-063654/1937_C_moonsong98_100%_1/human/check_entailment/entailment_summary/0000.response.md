Reasoning:

The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` in a permutation `p` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The provided functions are designed to interact with the problem's constraints and find the required indices.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for making the query and receiving the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
   - It correctly formats the query and reads the response, which is essential for the interactive nature of the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function outputs the final answer in the required format `! i j`.
   - It correctly flushes the output to ensure the answer is sent to the interactor.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
   - For `n == 2`, it directly outputs `! 0 1` because the only possible permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and the maximum XOR value is always `1`.
   - For `n > 2`, it follows a strategy to find the maximum and minimum indices:
     - It initializes `max_index` to 0 and iterates through all indices `i` to find the index that maximizes `(p_0 | p_i)`. This step ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element that, when ORed with `p_0`, gives the highest value.
     - It then finds all indices `min_indices` that minimize `(p_max_index | p_i)`. This step ensures that `min_indices` contains indices of elements that, when ORed with `p_max_index`, give the lowest value.
     - Finally, it selects the last index `min_index` from `min_indices` that satisfies `(p_min_index | p_min_index) == (p_min_index | p_i)`. This step ensures that `min_index` is the index of the element that is equal to itself when ORed with another element in `min_indices`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_3`:
- The final step of selecting `min_index` from `min_indices` using the condition `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i) == '='` is incorrect. The condition `p_min_index | p_min_index == p_min_index | p_i` will always be true because `p_min_index | p_min_index` is just `p_min_index`, and `p_min_index | p_i` will be `p_min_index` if `p_i` is 0. This does not help in finding the correct `min_index` that maximizes the XOR with `max_index`.

To correctly find the indices that maximize the XOR, the logic should be:
- After finding `max_index`, find the index `min_index` that minimizes `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
- Then, find the index `min_index` that, when XORed with `max_index`, gives the maximum XOR value.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always find the correct indices that maximize the XOR value.

Correctness: **False**
