To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_index` is 0.
   - `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`. If `res` is '<', the value of `res` remains '<'.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
   ```
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

4. **New State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is still an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2.
   - `max_index` and `res` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_index` is 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 0)`. If `res` is '<', the value of `res` remains '<'.**
