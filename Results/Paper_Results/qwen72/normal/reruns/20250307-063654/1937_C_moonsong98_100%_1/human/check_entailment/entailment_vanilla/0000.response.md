To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - \( n \) is between 2 and 10,000.
   - You can make at most \( 3n \) queries.
3. **Query**: Each query involves four indices \( a, b, c, d \) and returns a comparison between \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

### Solution Analysis:
The program is structured into three functions:
1. **func_1**: Sends a query and returns the result.
2. **func_2**: Prints the final answer.
3. **func_3**: Implements the main logic to find the indices.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Handling Small \( n \) (n = 2)**:
   - If \( n = 2 \), the permutation is either \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\).
   - In both cases, \( p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - The program correctly handles this by directly outputting \( ! 0 1 \).

2. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The program initializes \( max_index \) to 0.
   - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_0 \mid p_{max_index}) \) with \( (p_0 \mid p_i) \).
   - If \( (p_0 \mid p_i) \) is greater, \( max_index \) is updated to \( i \).
   - This step ensures that \( max_index \) is the index of the element that, when ORed with \( p_0 \), gives the maximum value.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
   - The program initializes a list \( min_indices \) with \( max_index \).
   - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{max_index} \mid p_{min_indices[0]}) \) with \( (p_{max_index} \mid p_i) \).
   - If \( (p_{max_index} \mid p_i) \) is smaller, \( min_indices \) is updated to contain only \( i \).
   - If \( (p_{max_index} \mid p_i) \) is equal, \( i \) is added to \( min_indices \).
   - This step ensures that \( min_indices \) contains all indices that, when ORed with \( max_index \), give the minimum value.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index**:
   - The program initializes \( min_index \) to the first element in \( min_indices \).
   - It iterates through all elements in \( min_indices \) and compares \( (p_{min_index} \mid p_{min_index}) \) with \( (p_{min_index} \mid p_i) \).
   - If \( (p_{min_index} \mid p_i) \) is equal, \( min_index \) is updated to \( i \).
   - This step ensures that \( min_index \) is the index of the element that, when ORed with itself, is equal to the minimum value found in the previous step.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program outputs \( ! max_index min_index \) as the final answer.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Query Efficiency**: The program uses at most \( 3n \) queries:
  - \( n \) queries to find \( max_index \).
  - \( n \) queries to find \( min_indices \).
  - \( n \) queries to find the final \( min_index \).
- **Logic**: The logic for finding \( max_index \) and \( min_indices \) is sound. The final step of selecting \( min_index \) from \( min_indices \) ensures that the XOR value is maximized.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where \( n = 2 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficient within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
