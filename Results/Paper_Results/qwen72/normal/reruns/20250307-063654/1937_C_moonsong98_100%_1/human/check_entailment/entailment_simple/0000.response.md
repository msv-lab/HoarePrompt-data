### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Handling Small Case (n = 2):**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 2` by immediately outputting the pair `(0, 1)` since the XOR of the only two elements in the permutation will always be `1`, which is the maximum possible value for `n = 2`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - The program initializes `max_index` to `0` and iterates through all indices `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it queries the comparison of `p_0 | p_max_index` with `p_0 | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when ORed with `p_0`, gives the maximum value.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices:**
   - The program initializes `min_indices` with `max_index` and iterates through all indices `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it queries the comparison of `p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]` with `p_max_index | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
   - This ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices `i` for which `p_max_index | p_i` is equal to the minimum value among all such comparisons.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index from `min_indices`:**
   - The program initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It iterates through all elements in `min_indices` and queries the comparison of `p_min_index | p_min_index` with `p_min_index | p_i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `min_index` is the index of the element in `min_indices` that, when ORed with itself, gives the minimum value.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the pair `(max_index, min_index)` as the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Query Count Analysis:
- **Finding the Maximum Index:**
  - This loop runs `n` times, making `n` queries.
- **Finding the Minimum Indices:**
  - This loop also runs `n` times, making another `n` queries.
- **Finding the Minimum Index from `min_indices`:**
  - This loop runs at most `n` times, making at most `n` queries.
- **Total Queries:**
  - The total number of queries is at most `3n`, which meets the problem's constraint.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized.
- The query count is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
