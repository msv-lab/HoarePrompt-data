Initial State: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range 3 <= n <= 10^4, `max_index` and `res` remain unchanged. If `res` is '<', then `max_index` is set to 1 and `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`. Otherwise, `max_index` and `res` retain their original values.

The code snippet:
```
res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The value of `i` is 2.
2. The value of `n` is within the range 3 <= n <= 10^4.
3. `max_index` and `res` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.
4. The code assigns the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` to `res`.
5. Since `i` is 2, the function call is `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 2)`.
6. The values of `max_index` and `res` before this assignment are not specified, so they remain unchanged.
7. The new value of `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 2)`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range 3 <= n <= 10^4, `max_index` remains unchanged, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 2)`.**
