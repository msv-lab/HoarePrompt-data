Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` must contain at least one element, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The value of `max_index` remains the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<'.
- The value of `res` is updated to the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, where `i` is `n-1`.
- The `min_indices` list still contains at least one element.
- The value of `min_index` remains the first element of `min_indices`.
- If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. However, since `i` is `n-1` and `max_index` is the last index for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `i` is not necessarily equal to `max_index`. Therefore, this condition does not change the state.
