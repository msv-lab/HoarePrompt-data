The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range 3 <= n <= 10^4, `max_index` and `res` remain unchanged. If `res` is '<', then `max_index` is set to 1 and `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`. Otherwise, `max_index` and `res` retain their original values.**
