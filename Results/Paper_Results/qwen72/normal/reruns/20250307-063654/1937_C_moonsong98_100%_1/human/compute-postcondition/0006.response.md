The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(0, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and is not equal to 2, which means `n` is at least 3. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the specified range and not equal to 2. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Since `n` is already in a valid range that ensures the loop will execute, no adjustment to `n` is needed. The variable `max_index` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0**
