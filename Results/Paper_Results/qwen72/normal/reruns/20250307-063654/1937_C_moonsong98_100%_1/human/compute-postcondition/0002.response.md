The code snippet provided calls a function `func_2` with the arguments 0 and 1. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact impact on the program state. Assuming `func_2` does not modify any global variables and does not return a value, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, and it is within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4. The current value of `n` is 2.**
