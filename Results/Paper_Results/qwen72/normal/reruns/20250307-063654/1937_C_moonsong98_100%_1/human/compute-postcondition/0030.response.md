The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is a list containing the value 0. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` is a list containing the values of `max_index` and 0. Otherwise, `min_indices` remains a list containing only the value of `max_index`.**
