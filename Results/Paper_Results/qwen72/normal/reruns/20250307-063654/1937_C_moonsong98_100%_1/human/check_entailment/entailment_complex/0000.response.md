Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor using the bitwise OR operation.
   - It takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query in the format `? a b c d`.
   - It then reads the response from the interactor, which can be `<`, `=`, or `>`, and returns this response.
   - The function correctly formats and prints the query and handles the input from the interactor.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for printing the final answer to the interactor.
   - It takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and prints the answer in the format `! a b`.
   - The function correctly formats and prints the answer.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function handles the main logic of the problem.
   - It reads the integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the permutation `p`.
   - If `n` is 2, it directly calls `func_2(0, 1)` because the maximum XOR for a permutation of length 2 is always between the two elements.
   - For `n > 2`, it performs the following steps:
     - **Finding the maximum index**:
       - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
       - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
       - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
       - This step ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element that, when ORed with `p_0`, gives the maximum value.
     - **Finding the minimum indices**:
       - It initializes `min_indices` with the current `max_index`.
       - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
       - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
       - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
       - This step ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices `i` such that `(p_max_index | p_i)` is equal to the maximum value found in the previous step.
     - **Finding the minimum index among `min_indices`**:
       - It initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
       - It iterates through all elements in `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)`.
       - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
       - This step ensures that `min_index` is the last index in `min_indices` that satisfies the condition.
     - Finally, it calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)` to print the answer.

4. **Query Count**:
   - The function `func_3` makes at most `3n` queries:
     - `n` queries to find the `max_index`.
     - `n` queries to find the `min_indices`.
     - `n` queries to find the `min_index` among `min_indices`.
   - This is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum XOR pair by first finding the index of the element that, when ORed with `p_0`, gives the maximum value.
   - It then finds all indices that, when ORed with `max_index`, give the same maximum value.
   - Finally, it selects the last index among these that satisfies the condition, ensuring that the XOR of `max_index` and `min_index` is maximized.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
