The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 1)`, `min_indices` contains the value 1 if `res` is '<', or the value of `max_index` if `res` is not '<' or '=', or the values of `max_index` and 0 if `res` is '=', or just 0 if `res` is '<'. If `res` is '=', `i` is set to 1.**
