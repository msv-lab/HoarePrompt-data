Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', and `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so the loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still within the specified range and not equal to 2.
- The variable `max_index` holds the last index `i` where the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned the value '<'.
- The variable `res` contains the result of the last call to `func_1` with the parameters `(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.
