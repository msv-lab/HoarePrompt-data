To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `min_indices`.

1. **`i`**: This variable will be set to each element in `min_indices` during the loop iterations. We do not need to adjust `i` directly before the loop starts because it will be assigned values from `min_indices` during the loop.

2. **`min_indices`**: For the loop to execute, `min_indices` must contain at least one element. If `min_indices` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2
- `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<'
- `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`
- `min_indices` is a list containing the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<' or '='
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`

The loop will execute if `min_indices` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `min_indices` contains at least one element.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` must contain at least one element, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`**
