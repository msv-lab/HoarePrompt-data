Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.**

The code initializes a list `min_indices` with the value of `max_index`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `max_index`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
