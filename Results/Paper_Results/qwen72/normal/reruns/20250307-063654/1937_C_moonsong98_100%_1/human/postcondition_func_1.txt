The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers within the range [0, n-1) where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`. It prints the string `! [a] [b]` to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the integer values of `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output that has been printed.
