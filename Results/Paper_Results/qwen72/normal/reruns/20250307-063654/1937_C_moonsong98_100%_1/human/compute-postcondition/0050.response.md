Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, n-1)` and is still '=', `min_indices` must contain at least one element, `min_index` is now `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- `min_index` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
