The loop head involves the variable `i` and the object `min_indices`. The state of `i` and `min_indices` can be adjusted based on the loop's requirements. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2
- `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<'
- `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, n-1)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `n-1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `min_indices`. Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `min_indices` must have at least one more element after `n-1`.

State: **`i` is the next element in `min_indices` after `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, n-1)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `n-1`.**
