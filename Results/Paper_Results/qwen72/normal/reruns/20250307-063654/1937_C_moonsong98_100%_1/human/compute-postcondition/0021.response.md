The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `n` is already greater than 0, so the loop will execute. However, the initial value of `i` is `n-1`, which is not the correct starting value for the loop. The loop expects `i` to start from 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts from 0, and `n` remains within the specified range.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`**
