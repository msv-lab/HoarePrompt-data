Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`, and `res` is currently '<'.**
