Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
    if res == '<':
        min_indices = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        min_indices.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is a list containing the value 0. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` is a list containing the values of `max_index` and 0. Otherwise, `min_indices` remains a list containing only the value of `max_index`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 1)`. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `min_indices` contains the value of `max_index` if `res` is not '<' or '=', or it contains the values of `max_index` and 0 if `res` is '=', or just 0 if `res` is '<'. If `res` is '=', `i` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 2)`. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `min_indices` contains the value 1 if `res` is '<', the value of `max_index` if `res` is not '<' or '=', the values of `max_index` and 0 if `res` is '=', or just 0 if `res` is '<'. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` now includes the value 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
