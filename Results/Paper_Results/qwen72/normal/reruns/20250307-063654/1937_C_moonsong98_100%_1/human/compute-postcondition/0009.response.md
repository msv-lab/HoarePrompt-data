Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, and the value of `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `max_index`. Since `i` was already 0, `max_index` remains 0. The other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected by this assignment.
