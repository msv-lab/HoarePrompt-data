Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` and `res` remain unchanged. If `res` is '<', then `max_index` is set to 1 and `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`. Otherwise, `max_index` and `res` retain their original values.***
