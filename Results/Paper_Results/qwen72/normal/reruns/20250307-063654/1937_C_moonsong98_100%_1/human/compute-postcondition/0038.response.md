Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 2)`, `min_indices` is now `[2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `min_indices = [i]` updates the `min_indices` list to contain only the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `max_index`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
