Output State: **`i` is the next element in `min_indices` after the previous `i`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` is '=', `min_index` is updated to `n-1`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. `min_indices` must have at least one more element after the current `i` for the loop to execute again.**
