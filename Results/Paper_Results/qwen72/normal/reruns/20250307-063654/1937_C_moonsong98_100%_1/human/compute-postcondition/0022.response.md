Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` updates the value of `res`.
- `min_indices[0]` is equal to `max_index`.
- `i` is 0.
- Therefore, `res` is now the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `max_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged.
