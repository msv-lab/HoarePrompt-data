Output State: **`i` has iterated through all elements in `min_indices`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of the last `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` call, and `min_index` is the last index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returned '='.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` has gone through each element in the list `min_indices`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still within the range 2 to 10^4 and not equal to 2.
- The value of `max_index` remains the same, still the last index for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<'.
- The variable `res` contains the result of the last call to `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`.
- The variable `min_index` is updated to the last index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returned '='. If no such index exists, `min_index` will retain its initial value.
