Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer provided by the user, within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4, and not equal to 2.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `max_index` remains 0.
- `res` is assigned the result of the function call `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, the exact value of `res` cannot be determined, but it is the result of the function call with the given arguments.
