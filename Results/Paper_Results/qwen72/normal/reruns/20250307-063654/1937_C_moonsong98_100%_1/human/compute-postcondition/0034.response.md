Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 1)`, and `min_indices` contains the value of `max_index` if `res` is not '<' or '=', otherwise it contains the values of `max_index` and 0 if `res` is '=', or just 0 if `res` is '<'. If `res` is '=', `i` is set to 1.***
