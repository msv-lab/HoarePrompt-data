Output State: **`i` has iterated through all elements in `min_indices`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of the last `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` call, `min_index` is the last index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returned '=', and `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.**

The code snippet `func_2(max_index, min_index)` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `max_index` and `min_index`. Since the function `func_2` does not return any value or modify any global variables, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been executed.
