You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`n` is an integer provided by the user, and it is within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2.
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            max_index = i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', and `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.
    min_indices = [max_index]
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)

        elif res == '=':
            min_indices.append(i)
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<' or '='.
    min_index = min_indices[0]
    for i in min_indices:
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        
        res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
        
        if res == '=':
            min_index = i
        
    #State: `i` has iterated through all elements in `min_indices`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of the last `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` call, and `min_index` is the last index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returned '='.
    func_2(max_index, min_index)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
