Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<' or '='.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is defined in the initial state and not modified within the loop.
- **`max_index`**: This variable retains its initial value, which is the last index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned '<'.
- **`res`**: The value of `res` is the result of the last call to `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`.
- **`min_indices`**: This list will contain all indices `i` for which the function `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned either '<' or '='. If `func_1` returned '<' for any `i`, that `i` will be the only element in the list. If `func_1` returned '=' for any `i`, that `i` will be appended to the list. If `func_1` never returned '<' or '=', the list will contain only the initial value of `max_index`.
