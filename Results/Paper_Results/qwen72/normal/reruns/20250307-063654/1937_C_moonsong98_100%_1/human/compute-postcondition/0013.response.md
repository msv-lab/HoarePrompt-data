Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is still an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 10^4 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 1, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`**

The value of `max_index` is now 1, as it has been updated to the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is still 1, `n` is still within the specified range, and `res` still holds the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`.
