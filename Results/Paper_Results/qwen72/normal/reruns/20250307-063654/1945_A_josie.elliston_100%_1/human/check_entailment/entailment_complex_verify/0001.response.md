Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.

### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
- **Logic**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3.
  - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete group of 3 with the remaining extroverts, so it returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
  - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents needed, considering both introverts and the result from `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) and the result from `func_1`.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case: 1 2 3**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 2 (needs 1 tent with 1 universal)
   - Universals: 3 (2 used with extroverts, 1 left alone)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (remaining universal) = 3
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 1 4 1**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, but only 1 universal available)
   - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the remaining extroverts)
   - **Output**: -1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 4 2**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, 2 universals available)
   - Universals: 2 (2 used with extroverts)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 3
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 1 (needs 1 tent with 2 others, but only 1 universal available)
   - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the extrovert)
   - **Output**: -1 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 1 3 2**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 3 (needs 1 tent, 2 universals available)
   - Universals: 2 (2 used with extroverts)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 2
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 19 7 18**
   - Introverts: 19 (needs 19 tents)
   - Extroverts: 7 (needs 3 tents, 2 universals left)
   - Universals: 18 (7 used with extroverts, 11 left)
   - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + 7 universals) + 4 (remaining universals) = 26
   - **Output**: 28 (Correct)

7. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Introverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Extroverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 0
   - **Output**: 0 (Correct)

8. **Test Case: 7 0 0**
   - Introverts: 7 (needs 7 tents)
   - Extroverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 7
   - **Output**: 7 (Correct)

9. **Test Case: 0 24 0**
   - Introverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Extroverts: 24 (needs 8 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 8
   - **Output**: 8 (Correct)

10. **Test Case: 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000**
    - Introverts: 1000000000 (needs 1000000000 tents)
    - Extroverts: 1000000000 (needs 333333334 tents)
    - Universals: 1000000000 (333333334 used with extroverts, 666666666 left)
    - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + 333333334 universals) + 222222222 (remaining universals) = 1666666667
    - **Output**: 1666666667 (Correct)

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Function 1** correctly checks if it is possible to form complete groups of 3 with extroverts and universals. If not, it returns `None`.
- **Function 2** correctly handles the result from `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to the result, or returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

Final: **True**
