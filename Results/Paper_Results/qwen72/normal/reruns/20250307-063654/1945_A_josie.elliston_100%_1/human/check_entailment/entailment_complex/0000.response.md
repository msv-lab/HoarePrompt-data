Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - The function checks if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3. If so, it further checks if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - If the above condition is not met, it calculates the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the total number of tents required, including those for introverts.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents required.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases and expected outputs are consistent with the logic of the functions.
   - For example, in the test case `1 2 3`, the introvert needs 1 tent, and the extroverts and universals can be accommodated in 2 more tents (1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals), totaling 3 tents.
   - In the test case `1 4 1`, the introvert needs 1 tent, and the extroverts need 2 more tents (1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 1 universal), but since the remaining extrovert cannot be accommodated with two others, the function returns -1.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `0 0 0` (returns 0) and large inputs (returns the correct number of tents).

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that extroverts can only be accommodated in groups of 3, and if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it returns `None`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly adds the number of tents required for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
