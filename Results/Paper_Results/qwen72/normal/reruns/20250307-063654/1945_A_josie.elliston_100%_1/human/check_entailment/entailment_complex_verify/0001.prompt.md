You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None

    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers such that 0 <= extroverts, universals <= 10^9. If extroverts is not divisible by 3, (extroverts % 3 + universals) is greater than or equal to 3.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are in the range 0 to 10^9. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

    #The program returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`, otherwise it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns -1 if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
3. **Universals**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
- **Logic**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3.
  - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete group of 3 with the remaining extroverts, so it returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
  - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

#### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents needed, considering both introverts and the result from `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) and the result from `func_1`.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case: 1 2 3**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 2 (needs 1 tent with 1 universal)
   - Universals: 3 (2 used with extroverts, 1 left alone)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (remaining universal) = 3
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 1 4 1**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, but only 1 universal available)
   - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the remaining extroverts)
   - **Output**: -1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 4 2**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, 2 universals available)
   - Universals: 2 (2 used with extroverts)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 3
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 1 (needs 1 tent with 2 others, but only 1 universal available)
   - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the extrovert)
   - **Output**: -1 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 1 3 2**
   - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
   - Extroverts: 3 (needs 1 tent, 2 universals available)
   - Universals: 2 (2 used with extroverts)
   - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 2
   - **Output**: 3 (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 19 7 18**
   - Introverts: 19 (needs 19 tents)
   - Extroverts: 7 (needs 3 tents, 2 universals left)
   - Universals: 18 (7 used with extroverts, 11 left)
   - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + 7 universals) + 4 (remaining universals) = 26
   - **Output**: 28 (Correct)

7. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Introverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Extroverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 0
   - **Output**: 0 (Correct)

8. **Test Case: 7 0 0**
   - Introverts: 7 (needs 7 tents)
   - Extroverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 7
   - **Output**: 7 (Correct)

9. **Test Case: 0 24 0**
   - Introverts: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Extroverts: 24 (needs 8 tents)
   - Universals: 0 (needs 0 tents)
   - Total tents: 8
   - **Output**: 8 (Correct)

10. **Test Case: 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000**
    - Introverts: 1000000000 (needs 1000000000 tents)
    - Extroverts: 1000000000 (needs 333333334 tents)
    - Universals: 1000000000 (333333334 used with extroverts, 666666666 left)
    - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + 333333334 universals) + 222222222 (remaining universals) = 1666666667
    - **Output**: 1666666667 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
