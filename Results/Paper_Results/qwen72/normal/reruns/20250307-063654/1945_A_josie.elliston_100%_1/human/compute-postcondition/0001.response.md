Output State: **The program returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`, otherwise it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.** 

Here, `introverts` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `universals` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The value of `ret` is the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`, which could be `None` or some integer value. If `ret` is `None`, the program returns -1. If `ret` is an integer, the program returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.
