Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with enough universals to form a complete tent of 3 people. For example, consider the input `1 4 1`:

- There is 1 introvert, which will need 1 tent.
- There are 4 extroverts, which require 2 tents (since each tent must have exactly 3 people, and 4 extroverts cannot form 2 complete tents).
- There is 1 universal, which is not enough to pair with the remaining 1 extrovert to form a complete tent.

The correct output for this case should be `-1` because it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. However, the program returns `3`, which is incorrect.
