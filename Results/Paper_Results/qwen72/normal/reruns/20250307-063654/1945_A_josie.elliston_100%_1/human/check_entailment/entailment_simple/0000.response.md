### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting the preferences of all participants.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents needed.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the case where `extroverts % 3 != 0` and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - The program correctly returns -1 when it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for all valid cases.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `(1, 2, 3)`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `(1, 4, 1)`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the input `(1, 4, 2)`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 1)`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the input `(1, 3, 2)`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `(19, 7, 18)`, the program correctly returns 28.
   - For the input `(0, 0, 0)`, the program correctly returns 0.
   - For the input `(7, 0, 0)`, the program correctly returns 7.
   - For the input `(0, 24, 0)`, the program correctly returns 8.
   - For the input `(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)`, the program correctly returns 1666666667.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and constraints. It respects the preferences of the participants and calculates the minimum number of tents needed or returns -1 when it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
**True**
