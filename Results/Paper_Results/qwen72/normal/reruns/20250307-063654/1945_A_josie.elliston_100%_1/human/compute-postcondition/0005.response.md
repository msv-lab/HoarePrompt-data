Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**

In natural language, this means the program returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the result of dividing the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. For example, if `extroverts` is 5 and `universals` is 4, the sum is 9, and the division by 3 is 3.0, so the ceiling of 3.0 is 3. If `extroverts` is 7 and `universals` is 2, the sum is 9, and the division by 3 is 3.0, so the ceiling of 3.0 is still 3. If `extroverts` is 2 and `universals` is 7, the sum is 9, and the division by 3 is 3.0, so the ceiling of 3.0 is 3. If `extroverts` is 1 and `universals` is 2, the sum is 3, and the division by 3 is 1.0, so the ceiling of 1.0 is 1. However, since `extroverts % 3 + universals` must be greater than or equal to 3 if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the smallest possible sum that meets this condition is 3, and the ceiling of 3/3 is 1. Therefore, the returned value will always be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
