Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if there are enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - If it's not possible to form a complete tent, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as per their preferences, so it returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the minimum number of tents is calculated correctly or -1 is returned if it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.
