Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining if the extroverts and universals can be accommodated in tents such that each tent with an extrovert has exactly 3 people.
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. Specifically, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and the function returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - If the condition is false or `extroverts` is divisible by 3, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that handles the overall accommodation.
   - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to check if the extroverts and universals can be accommodated.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, `func_2` adds the number of introverts to this result, as each introvert needs a separate tent.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that extroverts are accommodated in groups of 3, and if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it returns `None`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the case where it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals by returning -1, and otherwise, it returns the total number of tents needed, including those for introverts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`) correctly by returning 0.
   - It also handles the case where there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`) correctly by returning the number of introverts.
   - It handles the case where there are only extroverts and universals (`a = 0, b > 0, c > 0`) correctly by ensuring that the extroverts can be grouped in threes with the help of universals.
   - It handles the case where there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`) correctly by checking if `b` is divisible by 3.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `1 2 3`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `1 4 1`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the input `1 4 2`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the input `1 3 2`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the input `19 7 18`, the program correctly returns 28.
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the program correctly returns 0.
   - For the input `7 0 0`, the program correctly returns 7.
   - For the input `0 24 0`, the program correctly returns 8.
   - For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly returns 1666666667.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
