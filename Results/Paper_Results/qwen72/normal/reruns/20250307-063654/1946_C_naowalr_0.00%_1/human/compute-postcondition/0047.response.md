Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`, or `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`), `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

The code initializes `adj` as a list of `n + 1` empty lists, where `n` is the first integer read from the input. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
