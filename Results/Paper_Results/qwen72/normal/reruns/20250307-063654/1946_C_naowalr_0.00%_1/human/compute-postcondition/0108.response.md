The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `R - L > 1`. Right before the loop, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. For the loop to execute the first time, `R - L` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial values of `L` and `R`, `R - L` is `100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` now includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
