Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the integers read from the input.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The precondition that `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
