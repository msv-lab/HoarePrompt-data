Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended to the list), `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended to the list).**

The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. The initial state already mentioned that `adj[a]` includes `b` as one of its elements, so this operation is redundant and does not change the state. However, the initial state also mentioned that `adj[b]` includes `a` as one of its elements, so this information remains valid. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code.
