The only objects in the loop head are the variable `z` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `z` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0**
