The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended to the list).**
