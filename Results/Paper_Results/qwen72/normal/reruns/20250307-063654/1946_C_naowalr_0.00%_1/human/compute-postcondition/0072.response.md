Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= 50001), `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.***
