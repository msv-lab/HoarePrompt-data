The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 0, as it is the default starting point for `range(n - 1)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0**
