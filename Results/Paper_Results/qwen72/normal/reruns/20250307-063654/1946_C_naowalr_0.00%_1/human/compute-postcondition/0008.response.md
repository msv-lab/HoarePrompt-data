The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**
