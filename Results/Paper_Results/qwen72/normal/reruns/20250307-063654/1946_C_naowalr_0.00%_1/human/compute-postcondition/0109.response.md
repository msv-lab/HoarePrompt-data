Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` now includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
