Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `R - L` is greater than 1.**

The value of `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0, which is already the initial value, so no change occurs. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
