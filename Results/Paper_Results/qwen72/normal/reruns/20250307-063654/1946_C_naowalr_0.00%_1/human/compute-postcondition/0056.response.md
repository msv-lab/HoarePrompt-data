The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 2, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements twice, `i` is 2**
