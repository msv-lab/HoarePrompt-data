The code snippet assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. Since this is the same value that `numCuts` already had in the initial state, no change occurs to `numCuts`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` now includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**
