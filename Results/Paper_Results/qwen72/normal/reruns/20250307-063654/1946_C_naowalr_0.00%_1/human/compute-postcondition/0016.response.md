Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`z`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`adj`**: After the loop completes, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists. Each list in `adj` contains integers that were read from the input during the loop execution. Specifically, for each pair `(a, b)` read from the input, `adj[a]` will contain `b` and `adj[b]` will contain `a`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive), which is `n - 1` iterations.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are the last integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`adj[a]` and `adj[b]`**: These lists will contain all the `b` and `a` values, respectively, that were read during the loop execution. Each time the loop runs, it appends the corresponding value to the respective list.
