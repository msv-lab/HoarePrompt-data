Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`, `L` is 1, and `R` is 50001.***
