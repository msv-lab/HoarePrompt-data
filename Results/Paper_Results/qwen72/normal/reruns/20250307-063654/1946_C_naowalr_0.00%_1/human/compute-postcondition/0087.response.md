Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition is less than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with the leftover being at least `R`, and `numCuts` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `adj` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The variable `i` is still `n - 2`. The variable `L` will be the largest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition (either being less than or equal to `k` with a leftover less than `L`) is true. The variable `R` will be the smallest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition (either being greater than `k` or equal to `k` with a leftover at least `R`) is true. The variable `numCuts` will be 0, as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The loop will stop when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1.
