Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `adj[a]` containing `[b]` and `adj[b]` containing `[a]` is still valid after the code execution.
