Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n vertices.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`, or `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`), `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition is less than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts required to satisfy the condition is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with the leftover being at least `R`, and `numCuts` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < L)` holds, `R` is the smallest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= R)` holds, and `R - L` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
