Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `x` is the average of `L` and `R` rounded down to the nearest integer, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L > 1`.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0, which was previously not assigned a value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
