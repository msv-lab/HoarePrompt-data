Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**
