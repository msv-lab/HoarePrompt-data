Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. Therefore, after this operation, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
