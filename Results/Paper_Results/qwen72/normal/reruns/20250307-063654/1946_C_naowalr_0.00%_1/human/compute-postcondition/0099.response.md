Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended to the list).**

The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The initial state already mentioned that `adj[b]` includes `a` as one of its elements, so after the execution, `adj[b]` will have `a` appended again, making `a` appear twice in the list `adj[b]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
