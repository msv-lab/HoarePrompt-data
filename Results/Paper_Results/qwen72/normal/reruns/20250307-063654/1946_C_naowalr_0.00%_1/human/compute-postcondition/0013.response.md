Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input.**
