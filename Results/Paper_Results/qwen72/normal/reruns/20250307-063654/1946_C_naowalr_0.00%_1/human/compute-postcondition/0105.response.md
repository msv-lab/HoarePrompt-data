Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` now includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `L` is 1.**

The code snippet `L = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
