Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, and `adj[b]` now includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` must be at least 3, as the loop runs `n - 1` times.
- The loop index `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- The adjacency list `adj` will have been updated such that for each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from the input during the loop, `b` will be appended to the list `adj[a]`, and `a` will be appended to the list `adj[b]`. This means that each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain all the corresponding `b` and `a` values, respectively, that were read during the loop's execution.
