Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `L` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`.
- `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, which means `L` now holds this value.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
