Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` explicitly sets the variable `numCuts` to 0. Since this variable was already initialized to 0 in the initial state, the value of `numCuts` remains 0. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
