Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
