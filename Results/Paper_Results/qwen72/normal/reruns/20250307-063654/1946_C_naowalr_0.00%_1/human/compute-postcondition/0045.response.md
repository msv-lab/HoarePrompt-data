The only object in the loop head is the variable `z`, and the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `z` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `z` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `z` will be 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`, or `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`), `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0**
