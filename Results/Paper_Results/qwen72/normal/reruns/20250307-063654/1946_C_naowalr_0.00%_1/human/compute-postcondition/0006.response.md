Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`.** 

The value `b` has been appended to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
