Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than 50001), then `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.***
