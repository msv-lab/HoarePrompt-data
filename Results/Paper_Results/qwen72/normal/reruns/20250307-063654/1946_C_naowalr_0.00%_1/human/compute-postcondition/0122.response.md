Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `R = x` assigns the value of `x` to `R`. Since `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `R` now holds this same value. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
