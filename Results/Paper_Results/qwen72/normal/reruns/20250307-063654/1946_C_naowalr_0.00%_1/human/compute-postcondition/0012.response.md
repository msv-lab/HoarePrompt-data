The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`**
