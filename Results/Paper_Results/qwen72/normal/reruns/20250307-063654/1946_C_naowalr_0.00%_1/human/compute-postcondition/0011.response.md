Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[a]`.
- After the code execution, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
