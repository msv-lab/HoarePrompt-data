Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements, `i` is 1, and `b` has been appended to `adj[a]` again.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 2, `a` and `b` are still integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element (it already included `b` before, so `b` is now listed twice in `adj[a]`), `adj[b]` still includes `a` as one of its elements, and `i` remains 1.
