Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended to the list), `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**

The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, and `adj[b]` still includes `a` as one of its elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain the same.
