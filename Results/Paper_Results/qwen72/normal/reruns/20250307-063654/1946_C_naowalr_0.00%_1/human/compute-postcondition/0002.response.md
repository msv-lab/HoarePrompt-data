Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now integers that have been read from the standard input, split by spaces, and converted to integers using the `map` function. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `z` is still 0.
