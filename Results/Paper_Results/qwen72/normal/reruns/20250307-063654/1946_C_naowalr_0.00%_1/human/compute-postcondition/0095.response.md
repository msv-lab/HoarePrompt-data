Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.** 

The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Therefore, after the code is executed, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
