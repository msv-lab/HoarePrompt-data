The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept these parameters and return a value or values that are determined by the relationships and constraints of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the structure of the tree represented by `adj`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= k < n <= 10^5), and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. The function returns a value or values based on these inputs.**
