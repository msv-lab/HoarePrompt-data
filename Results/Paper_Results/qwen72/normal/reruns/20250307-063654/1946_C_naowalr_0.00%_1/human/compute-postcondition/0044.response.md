To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `z` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input.
   - `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop.
   - `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop.
   - `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`, or `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`).
   - `R` is `L + 1`.
   - `numCuts` is 0.

2. **Understanding `L` and `R`:**
   - `L` is determined based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`.
   - `R` is simply `L + 1`.

3. **Key Variables:**
   - `numCuts` is initialized to 0.
   - `leftover` is not explicitly defined, so it must be a variable that is calculated or updated during the execution of the program.
   - `L` is the critical variable that needs to be determined based on the conditions provided.

4. **Conditions for `L`:**
   - `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`.
   - Alternatively, `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`).

Since the exact values of `numCuts` and `leftover` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe `L` based on the conditions given:

- `L` is the integer that satisfies the conditions described above, which are dependent on the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(L)` statement will be:

Output: **L (where L is the largest integer such that numCuts <= k and leftover < L when x = L, or the smallest integer such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L))**
