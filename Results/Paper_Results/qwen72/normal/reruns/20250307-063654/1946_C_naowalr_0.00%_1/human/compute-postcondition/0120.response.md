Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` updates the value of `leftover` to the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `numCuts`, `L`, `R`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The conditions for `L` and `R` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
