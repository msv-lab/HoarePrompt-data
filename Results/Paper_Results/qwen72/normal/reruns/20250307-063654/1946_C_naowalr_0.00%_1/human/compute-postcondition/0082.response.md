Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L` must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0, but since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
