Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, and `i` is `n - 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, as the loop iterates `n - 1` times.
- The variables `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- The list `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list `adj[i]` (for indices from 1 to `n`) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input. This means that for each pair `(a, b)` read from the input, `b` is added to `adj[a]` and `a` is added to `adj[b]`.
- The variable `i` is `n - 2` after the loop has completed all its iterations, as it is decremented in each iteration but the loop condition is checked before the body is executed.
