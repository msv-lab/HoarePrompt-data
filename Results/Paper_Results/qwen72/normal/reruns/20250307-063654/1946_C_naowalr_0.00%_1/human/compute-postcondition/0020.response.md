To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `L` and `R`.

The loop condition is `R - L > 1`. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true. Given the initial state:

- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

Let's evaluate the condition with these values:
- `R - L` is `100001 - 1`, which equals `100000`.

Since `100000 > 1` is true, the loop condition is already satisfied, and the loop can execute without any adjustments.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was before the loop:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
