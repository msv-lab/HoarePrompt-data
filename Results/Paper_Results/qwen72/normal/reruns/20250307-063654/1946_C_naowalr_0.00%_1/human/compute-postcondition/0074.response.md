Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 <= i <= n) contains the integers that were paired with `i` in the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= 50001), `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the result of `(L + R) // 2`.
- If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, so `x` becomes `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, so `x` becomes `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `i`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `k`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
