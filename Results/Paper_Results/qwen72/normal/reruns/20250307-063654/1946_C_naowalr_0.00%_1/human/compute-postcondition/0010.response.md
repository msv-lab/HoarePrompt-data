Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list is not necessarily empty, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

Explanation:
- `adj[a]` initially contains `[b]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
