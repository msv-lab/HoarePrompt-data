Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `R - L` is greater than 1. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.***
