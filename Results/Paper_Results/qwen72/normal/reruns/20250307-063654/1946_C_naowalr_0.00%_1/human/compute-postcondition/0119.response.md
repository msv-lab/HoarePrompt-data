Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` includes all the `b` values read in the loop as elements, `adj[b]` includes all the `a` values read in the loop as elements, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is greater than 50002. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`, `L` is 1, and `R` is greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `numCuts = 0` resets the value of `numCuts` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions but with `numCuts` updated to 0.
