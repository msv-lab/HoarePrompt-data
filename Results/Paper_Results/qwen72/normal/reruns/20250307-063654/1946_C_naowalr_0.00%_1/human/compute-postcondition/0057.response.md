Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements twice, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
- The lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` still include the elements `b` and `a` twice, respectively.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
