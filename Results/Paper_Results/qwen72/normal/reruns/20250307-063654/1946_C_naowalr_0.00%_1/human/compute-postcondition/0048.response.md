To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized by the `range` function, so we don't need to explicitly set `i` before the loop starts. However, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Let's break it down:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `z` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input (not relevant to the loop head).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is `n - 2` (this will be overridden by the loop).
- `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input (not relevant to the loop head).
- `L` is the largest integer such that `numCuts` <= `k` and `leftover` < `L` when `x` = `L`, or `L` is the smallest integer such that `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `L`) (not relevant to the loop head).
- `R` is `L + 1` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `numCuts` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 2. The variable `i` will be set by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust it explicitly.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
