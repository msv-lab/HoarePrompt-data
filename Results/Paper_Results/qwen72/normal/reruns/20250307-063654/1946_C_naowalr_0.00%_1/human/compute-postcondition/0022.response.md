Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all `b` values read in the loop, `adj[b]` now contains all `a` values read in the loop, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` resets the variable `numCuts` to 0, but since it was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `numCuts` remains unchanged. All other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
