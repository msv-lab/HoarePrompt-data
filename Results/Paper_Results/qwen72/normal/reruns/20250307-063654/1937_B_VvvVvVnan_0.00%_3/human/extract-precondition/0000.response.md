Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of n values for each test case (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), and a list of 2D binary strings (each of length n) representing the 2 × n grid for each test case. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, grid_list):
```

Where:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n_list` is a list of integers, each representing the width of the grid for a test case.
- `grid_list` is a list of 2D binary strings, each representing the grid for a test case.
