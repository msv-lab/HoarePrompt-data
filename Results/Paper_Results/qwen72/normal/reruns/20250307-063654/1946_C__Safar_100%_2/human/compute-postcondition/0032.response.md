Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer less than `n`.
- `edges` is a list of tuples.
- `g` is a list of lists.
- `c` is 0.
- `l` is `r + 1` or `r` is `l - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `r` is mentioned in the initial state, but its exact value is not provided directly. Instead, we are given a relationship between `r` and `l`.
- The relationship is either `l = r + 1` or `r = l - 1`. This means that `r` is one less than `l`.

### Determining the Value of `r`:
- Since `r` is defined in terms of `l`, and `l` is not explicitly given, we can only describe `r` in terms of `l`.
- The value of `r` will be `l - 1`.

### Output:
The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is `l - 1`.
Output: **r (where r is l - 1)**
