Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with keys as integers from 1 to n, and values as lists of integers representing connected nodes, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1), visited is an empty set, x is 1, p is 1, and x is in visited. If d[x] is greater than or equal to A, then r is 1 and d[x] is greater than or equal to A. Otherwise, r is 0 and d[x] is updated to 2, with d[x] being less than A.***
