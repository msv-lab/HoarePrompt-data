Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[a]` contains all the integers `b` for which there is an edge (a, b) in `edges`, and each list `g[b]` contains all the integers `a` for which there is an edge (a, b) in `edges`, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n // k`.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples, `g` is a list of lists, `c` is 0, `mid` is `1 + (n // k - 1) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is `2 + (n // k - 1) // 2` and `r` is `n // k`. If `check(mid)` is false, `l` is 1 and `r` is `(n // k - 1) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples, `g` is a list of lists, `c` is 0, and `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` remains `n // k`. If `check(mid)` is false, `r` is updated to `mid - 1` and `l` remains 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples, `g` is a list of lists, `c` is 0, and `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. If `check(mid)` is false, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. `l` must be less than or equal to `r` for the loop to execute one more time.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
