Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with keys as integers from 1 to n, and values as lists of integers representing connected nodes. `stack` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1)` and `(node, 1)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `1`, `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `(1: 1)`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next connected node in `g[1]` that is not in `visited`.**

Explanation:
- The code `stack.append((node, x))` adds the tuple `(node, 1)` to the `stack`.
- The initial `stack` contained the tuple `(1, 1)`, and now it also contains the tuple `(node, 1)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
