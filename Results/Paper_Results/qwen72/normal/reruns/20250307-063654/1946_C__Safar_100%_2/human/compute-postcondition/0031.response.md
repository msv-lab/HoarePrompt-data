Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples, `g` is a list of lists, `c` is 0, `l` is `r + 1` or `r` is `l - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variables `n`, `k`, `edges`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `c` also remains 0, as it is not altered within the loop.

The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Each iteration of the loop updates either `l` or `r` based on the result of the `check(mid)` function. When the loop terminates, it means that `l` has become greater than `r` or `r` has become less than `l`. This is the final state of the loop, where `l` and `r` are adjacent integers, with `l` being one more than `r` or vice versa.
