#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is a positive integer less than n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n, representing an edge between vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n, and `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[a]` contains all the integers `b` for which there is an edge (a, b) in `edges`, and each list `g[b]` contains all the integers `a` for which there is an edge (a, b) in `edges`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples, `g` is a list of lists, `c` is 0, `l` is `r + 1` or `r` is `l - 1`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is l - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge between two vertices. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. After performing a binary search, it prints the value of `r`, which is the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved by removing `k` edges from the tree. The function does not return any value.
