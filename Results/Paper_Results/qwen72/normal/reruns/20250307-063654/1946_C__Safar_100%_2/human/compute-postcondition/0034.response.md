Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge between two vertices. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. After performing a binary search, it prints the value of `r`, which is the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved by removing `k` edges from the tree. The function does not return any value. **
