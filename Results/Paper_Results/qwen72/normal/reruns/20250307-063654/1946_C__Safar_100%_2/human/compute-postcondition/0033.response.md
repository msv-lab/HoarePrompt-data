The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in a tree. `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, representing the number of edges to be removed. `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n, representing an edge between vertices a and b.

The function returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge between two vertices. It returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.**
