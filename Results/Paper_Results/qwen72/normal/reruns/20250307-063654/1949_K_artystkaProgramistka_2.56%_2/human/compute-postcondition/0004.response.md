Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**

The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called, but without the definition of this function, we cannot determine the specific changes it makes to the state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that the function has been called.
