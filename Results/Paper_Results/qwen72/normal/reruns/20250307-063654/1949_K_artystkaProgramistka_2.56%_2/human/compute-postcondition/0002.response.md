Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.** 

The variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` have been initialized to 0, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
