Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and distributes the elements into three groups: `group_a` (first `na` elements), `group_b` (next `nb` elements), and `group_c` (last `nc` elements). It then checks if a condition defined by `func_1` is met for the sums of these groups. If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If the condition is not met, it returns 'NO'. **
