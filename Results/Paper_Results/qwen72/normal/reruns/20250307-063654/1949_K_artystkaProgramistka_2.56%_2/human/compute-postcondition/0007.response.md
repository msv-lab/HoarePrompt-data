The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers`, and `num` is the current element being processed in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in `numbers`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element in `numbers`.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third element in `numbers`**
