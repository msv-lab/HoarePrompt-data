The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`. `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns:
- Case_1: 'YES' along with three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of the sorted list `numbers` in descending order, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements.
- Case_2: 'NO'

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the conditions are met, where `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of the sorted list `numbers` in descending order, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements. If the conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.**
