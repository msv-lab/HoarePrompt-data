The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has more than one element, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element in `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` will be the second element in `numbers`.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the second element in `numbers`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**
