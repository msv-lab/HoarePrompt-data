Postcondition: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a` is a list containing the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` is a list containing the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, and `group_c` is a list containing the last `nc` elements of `numbers`. `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True` for the current values of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`.**
