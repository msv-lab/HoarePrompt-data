Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**. This means that the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluated to `False` based on the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, which are derived from the list `numbers` and the positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
