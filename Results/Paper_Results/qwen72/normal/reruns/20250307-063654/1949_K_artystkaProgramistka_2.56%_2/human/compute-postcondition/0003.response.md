The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least one element. Since the state before the loop starts indicates that `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, and `n` is a positive integer, we can infer that `numbers` is not empty. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to explicitly state that `numbers` has at least one element and `num` is the first element in the list.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers`**
