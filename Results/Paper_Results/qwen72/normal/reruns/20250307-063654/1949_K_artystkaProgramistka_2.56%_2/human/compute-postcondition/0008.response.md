Initial State: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.

The function `distribute_number(num)` is called, but the function itself is not provided. Assuming the function `distribute_number(num)` appends `num` to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`) and updates the corresponding sum (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c`), we need to consider the possible outcomes.

Since the function is not defined, we can only assume the most straightforward behavior, which is appending `num` to one of the groups and updating the sum accordingly. Without loss of generality, let's assume `num` is appended to `group_a` and `sum_a` is updated.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `group_a` is a list containing the third element of `numbers`, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is the third element of `numbers`, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.**
