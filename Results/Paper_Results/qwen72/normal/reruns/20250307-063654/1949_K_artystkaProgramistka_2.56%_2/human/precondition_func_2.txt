num is a positive integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9), and the variables sum_a, sum_b, sum_c, group_a, group_b, group_c, na, nb, and nc are defined such that sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are non-negative integers representing the current sums of the groups, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists to store the numbers in each group, and na, nb, and nc are positive integers representing the desired sizes of the three groups, with the condition that na + nb + nc = n, where n is the total number of integers to be split.
