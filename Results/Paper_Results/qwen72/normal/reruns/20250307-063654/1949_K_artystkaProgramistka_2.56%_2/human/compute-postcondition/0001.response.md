Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list.**

The initial state variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and `numbers` is still a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. The code initializes three new empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
