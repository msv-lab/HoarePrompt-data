Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers:
    distribute_number(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the second element in `numbers`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called. The specific changes depend on the implementation of `distribute_number(num)`, but typically, this function would distribute `num` to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`) and update the corresponding sum (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c`). Without the exact implementation, we cannot specify the exact changes, but we can say that one of the groups and one of the sums will be updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `group_a` is a list containing the third element of `numbers`, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is the third element of `numbers`, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
