### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - The program iterates over the required difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it is missing in the string), it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because `m` problems of that difficulty are needed.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is present but has fewer than `m` occurrences, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to the answer `ans` to make up for the shortfall.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- It correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure each round has one problem of each difficulty level.
- The logic for calculating the number of additional problems is sound and follows the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
