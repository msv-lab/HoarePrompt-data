### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Counter Usage:**
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is a valid and efficient way to count the frequencies of each character.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'` to check for each difficulty level whether it is present in the problem bank `s`. If a difficulty level is not present, it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad will need to create `m` problems of that difficulty level for `m` rounds. This is correct.

4. **Additional Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates over the keys in the `Counter` object `hmp` to check if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the additional problems needed to meet the requirement of `m` problems for each difficulty level. This is also correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. This is consistent with the problem description.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
   - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
   - The program checks for each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
     - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
     - 'F' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
   - Final `ans` is 2, which matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
   - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
   - The program checks for each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
     - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 2`
     - 'F' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 2`
     - 'G' is present but only 1, so `ans += 1`
   - Final `ans` is 5, which matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
   - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
   - The program checks for each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
     - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
   - Final `ans` is 1, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the occurrences of each difficulty level, and calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds. It produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
