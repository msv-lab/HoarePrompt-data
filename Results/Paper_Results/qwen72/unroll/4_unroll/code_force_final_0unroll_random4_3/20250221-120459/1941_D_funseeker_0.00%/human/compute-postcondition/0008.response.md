To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that affect the set `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- If `0` is in the set `ans`:
  - `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding the value `0`.
  - `n` is added to the set `ans`.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check if `0` is in `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, the set `ans` will be updated to include all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding `0`.
   - Additionally, `n` will be added to the set `ans`.

2. **If `0` is not in `ans`**:
   - The set `ans` will be updated to include all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.

3. **Determine the final size of `ans`**:
   - The size of `ans` will depend on the initial values in `ans` and the values returned by `func_1()`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, the size will be the number of unique values generated by the operations, excluding `0`, plus the value `n`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, the size will be the number of unique values generated by the operations.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and the initial set `ans` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical size of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of the set `ans` after the described operations.

Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding `0` if `0` is in `ans` and including `n` if `0` is in `ans`)**
