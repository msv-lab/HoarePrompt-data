Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on the integers `n`, `m`, and `x` which are obtained from the function `func_3`. The function computes a set `ans` that contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during `m` iterations. If `0` is in the final set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the length of the set `ans` and the elements of the set `ans`. The integers `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
