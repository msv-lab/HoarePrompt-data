### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line from the input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is used to read individual lines of input.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - `func_4` is the main function that simulates the game for each test case.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?'.
   - The set `ans` is updated by adding the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the current set `ans`.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because the player numbered `n` is the same as player `0` in a circular arrangement.
   - The function then prints the number of players in the set `ans` and the players themselves in increasing order.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Reading Input**:
  - `func_1` and `func_3` correctly handle reading and parsing the input.
  - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases.

- **Game Logic**:
  - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.
  - The loop iterates `m` times, correctly simulating each throw.
  - The conditions for updating the set `ans` are correct:
    - If `c` is '0', the ball is thrown clockwise, and `(q + r) % n` is added to the set.
    - If `c` is '1', the ball is thrown counterclockwise, and `(q - r) % n` is added to the set.
    - If `c` is '?', both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are added to the set to account for both possible directions.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The check to replace `0` with `n` is necessary because player `0` and player `n` are the same in a circular arrangement.
  - The final output correctly prints the number of players who could have the ball and the players themselves in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game and handles all the edge cases and input constraints as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
