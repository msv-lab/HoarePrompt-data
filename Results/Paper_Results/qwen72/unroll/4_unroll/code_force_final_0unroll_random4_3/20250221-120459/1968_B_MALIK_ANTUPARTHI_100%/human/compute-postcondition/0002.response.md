Output State: **The loop will print the index `k` for each test case, where `k` is the position in string `d` up to which a matching substring from `e` has been found. The state of `t`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are updated for each iteration of the loop, but their final values after the loop depends on the input provided during each test case.**
