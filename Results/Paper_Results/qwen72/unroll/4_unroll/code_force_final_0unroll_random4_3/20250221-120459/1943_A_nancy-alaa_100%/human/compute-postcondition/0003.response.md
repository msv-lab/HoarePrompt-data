Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of size `n`. It then finds and prints the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or, if all integers from 0 to `n` are present, the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, and the program state is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed. **
