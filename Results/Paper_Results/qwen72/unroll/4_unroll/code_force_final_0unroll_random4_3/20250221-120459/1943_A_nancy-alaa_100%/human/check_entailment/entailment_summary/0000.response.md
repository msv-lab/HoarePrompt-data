Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX of an array `c` that is constructed during the game between Alice and Bob, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players.

1. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should try to include the smallest integers that are not yet in `c` and are available in `a`.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to remove the smallest integers that are not yet in `c` and are available in `a`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - If an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not appear in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is the MEX of the array `c` if `i` is the smallest integer not present in `arr`.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n` are present in `arr`, it looks for the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once. This is because Alice and Bob will play optimally, and the first integer that appears exactly once will be the MEX if all smaller integers are present.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - The smallest integer not in `arr` is 2.
     - The program correctly prints 2.
   - **Example 2**: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - The smallest integer not in `arr` is 4.
     - However, since all integers from 0 to 3 are present, the program looks for the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once.
     - The first integer that appears exactly once is 0, and the next smallest integer that appears exactly once is 1.
     - The program correctly prints 1.
   - **Example 3**: `arr = [1, 1]`
     - The smallest integer not in `arr` is 0.
     - The program correctly prints 0.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` by finding the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first such integer.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where some integers are missing from `arr`.

Given the above reasoning and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
