You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` where the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`. It checks whether it is possible to balance the water levels in the containers represented by the list `a` such that each container has the same amount of water. If it is possible to balance the water levels without any container having a negative amount of water during the process, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the function returns either 'Yes' or 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then assumes the first element is the number of test cases, `n`, and the rest are the elements of the array `a`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases properly. The input format specifies that each test case has its own `n` and `a` values, and these should be processed separately.

2. **Sum and Target Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - The target amount of water in each container is correctly calculated as `total_water // n`.

3. **Container Balancing**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and keeps a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is based on the idea that if the running total becomes negative, it means that the current container cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the first test case only. It does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and it incorrectly processes the input. The logic for determining if the containers can be balanced is correct, but the implementation is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
