The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The variable `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition, but it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
