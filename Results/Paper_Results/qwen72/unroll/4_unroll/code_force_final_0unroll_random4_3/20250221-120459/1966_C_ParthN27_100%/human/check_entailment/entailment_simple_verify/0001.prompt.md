You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: The loop will have finished executing, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will retain their initial values, but the variables `s` and `ans` will have been modified and reset for each test case. After the loop, `s` will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last test case, with a 0 prepended, and `ans` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the last test case's result.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves \( n \) piles of stones.
   - On each turn, a player can choose a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice can always win by choosing \( k \) such that the smallest pile size is reduced to zero on her turn, leaving Bob with an even number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves, ensuring that the number of distinct pile sizes remains even until Alice is forced to make the last move.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It then creates a set of the pile sizes to get the distinct pile sizes.
   - The set is converted to a list and sorted.
   - A zero is prepended to the list to handle edge cases.
   - The program checks if the number of distinct pile sizes is 2 (i.e., all piles have the same size). If so, Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted list of distinct pile sizes and checks if there is a gap greater than 1 between consecutive sizes. If such a gap is found, it breaks the loop.
   - The variable `ans` is used to track the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. It is initialized to 1 (odd).
   - The loop toggles `ans` with each iteration, effectively counting the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `ans` is 1 (odd) and "Bob" if `ans` is 0 (even).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - It correctly handles the case where all piles have the same size (i.e., the set has only one distinct size, and the list has two elements after prepending zero).
   - The loop and the parity check are correctly implemented to determine the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
