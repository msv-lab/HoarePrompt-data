Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case based on the number of stones in the piles. It does not return any value. For each test case, the function determines if the piles of stones can be manipulated such that Alice wins the game, and if so, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. The function modifies and resets internal variables for each test case, but the input variables `t` and the list of lists are not altered. **
