Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `pair_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'.
- `max_item_idx` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

### Explanation:
- `max_item_idx` is a variable that remains unchanged from its initial value. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `max_item_idx`, we can only describe it as the value it had before the print statement was executed.
- `pair_idx` is a variable that is determined based on the results of `func_1`. Specifically, it is the highest index `i` where `func_1` returned '<' or the highest index `i` where `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'. Again, the initial state does not provide specific values for the results of `func_1`, so we can only describe `pair_idx` in terms of these conditions.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string with the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` as described in the initial state.
Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where [max_item_idx] is the unchanged value of `max_item_idx` and [pair_idx] is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>')**
