Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor. It takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query in the format `? a b c d`. It then reads the response from the interactor and returns it. This function is correctly implemented as per the problem's interaction rules.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is the main logic of the solution. It aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries.

   - **First Loop**: The function starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` of the element in the permutation `p` that is the largest when compared to all other elements using the bitwise OR operation. This is done by comparing `p[max_item_idx] | p[max_item_idx]` with `p[i] | p[i]` for all `i` in the range `[1, n)`. If `p[i] | p[i]` is greater, `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`. This loop ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

   - **Second Loop**: The function then tries to find a `pair_idx` such that the XOR of `p[max_item_idx]` and `p[pair_idx]` is maximized. It does this by comparing `p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx]` with `p[max_item_idx] | p[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`. If `p[max_item_idx] | p[i]` is greater, `pair_idx` is updated to `i`. If they are equal, it further checks if `p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx]` is less than `p[i] | p[i]` to ensure that `pair_idx` is the index of the element that maximizes the XOR with `p[max_item_idx]`.

   - **Output**: Finally, the function prints the result in the format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`.

3. **Query Count**: The function `func_2` uses at most `2n` queries in the worst case (one query for each comparison in both loops). Since the problem allows up to `3n` queries, the function is within the allowed limit.

4. **Correctness of XOR Maximization**: The approach used in `func_2` is correct for finding the maximum XOR. By first finding the index of the maximum element in the permutation, the function ensures that one of the elements in the pair is the largest possible. Then, by comparing the OR results and ensuring the XOR is maximized, it correctly identifies the pair of indices that yield the maximum XOR.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly, as it will always find the pair `(0, 1)` which is the only possible pair and will yield the maximum XOR.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
