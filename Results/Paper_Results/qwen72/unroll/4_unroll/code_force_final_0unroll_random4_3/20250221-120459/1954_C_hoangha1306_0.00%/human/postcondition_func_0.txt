The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from input, each containing digits from 1 to 9. It then constructs two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` by comparing the corresponding digits of `a` and `b`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first difference encountered, and then the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit is added to `kq2` for all subsequent differences. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
