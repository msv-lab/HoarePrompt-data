Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of substrings. It then processes each test case by parsing the necessary integers from the list. This approach is efficient for the given constraints, as it avoids multiple calls to input() which can be slow.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `pf`. This is a crucial step because it allows for the quick computation of the XOR of any subarray using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this prefix XOR occurs. This helps in efficiently checking if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XORs. If the XOR of the subarray is 0, it means the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. If the XOR is not 0, the program checks if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i < j <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[j]`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results of all queries, each on a new line, which matches the required output format.

However, there is a critical issue in the function definition and the initial call to `func_1()`:

- The function `func_1()` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing the necessary data for each test case.
- The initial call to `func_1()` is incorrect because it should pass the parsed input data to the function. The correct call should be something like `func_1(t, test_cases)` where `test_cases` is a list of parsed test cases.

Given these issues, the program as written will not function correctly. The function `func_1()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, and the initial call to `func_1()` is missing the required parameters.

Correctness: **False**
