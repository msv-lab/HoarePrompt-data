You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description.

Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the query. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling large inputs.
   - The program uses an index to traverse the input list, which is a common approach for parsing input in this format.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows for quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part's XOR is `0`, making it interesting.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - If such indices exist and are valid, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part's XOR is the same, making it interesting.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for all queries are collected in a list and printed at the end.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated. For each element `a[i]`, `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.

- **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
  - The dictionary `mp` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value. This helps in quickly finding if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value within a given range.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query, the program correctly calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
  - If the XOR is `0`, the subarray is interesting, and the program correctly appends "YES" to the results.
  - If the XOR is not `0`, the program uses binary search to find if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value. This is a correct approach because if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value within the range, it means the subarray can be divided into parts with the same XOR.

- **Binary Search:**
  - The binary search is correctly used to find the first index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the last index in `mp[pf[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
  - The conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` ensure that the indices are valid.
  - The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that the indices are within the range and can be used to divide the subarray into parts with the same XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the input, constructs the necessary data structures, and processes the queries to determine if the subarrays are interesting.
