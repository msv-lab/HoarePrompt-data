The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, but it does not guarantee that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of substrings from the input string, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
