Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `data` is a list of substrings from the input string.
   - `index` is the index after all loop iterations.
   - `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains a series of strings, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each element in the `results` list will be printed on a new line.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact content of the `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values.
   - However, we know that the output will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' values, each on a new line.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' for each query, each on a new line (where the exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values depends on the content of the `results` list)**
