Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**: The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of substrings. This is a common technique used in competitive programming to optimize input reading. The function then iterates over the input data to parse the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the number of queries, the array elements, and the query ranges.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**: The function constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This is a crucial step because it allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l] to a[r]` in constant time using `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping XOR Values to Indices**: The function uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding if there are any subarrays within the query range that have the same prefix XOR value, which is necessary for determining if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the function computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using the prefix XOR array. If the XOR is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values, and the function appends 'YES' to the results. If the XOR is not zero, the function checks if there exists a subarray within the query range that has a zero XOR by comparing the indices stored in `mp`.

5. **Output**: After processing all queries for all test cases, the function prints the results, which are a series of 'YES' and 'NO' values, each on a new line.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing the necessary data for each test case.

- **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which will result in an error. The function should be called with the appropriate arguments, such as `func_1(t, test_cases)`.

- **Input Handling**: The function reads the entire input at once and processes it, which is generally fine for the given constraints. However, the input handling should be more robust to ensure that the input is correctly parsed and used.

Given these issues, the program as it stands is not correct. However, if these issues are fixed, the logic and the approach used in the function are correct and should work for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**

To make the program correct, the function definition and call should be fixed, and the input handling should be more robust. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, q, a, queries in test_cases:
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for l, r in queries:
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
    
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input_data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input_data[index])
        q = int(input_data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = [int(input_data[index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        index += n
        queries = [(int(input_data[index + 2 * i]), int(input_data[index + 2 * i + 1])) for i in range(q)]
        index += 2 * q
        test_cases.append((n, q, a, queries))
    
    func_1(t, test_cases)
```

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem.
