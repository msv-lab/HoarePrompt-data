Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `costs` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` becomes `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - Since `0 // any_non_zero_number` is 0, `0 // (1 - k)` is 0.
   - `n // 1`:
     - `0 // 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition:**
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - From the calculation, `h` is 0.
   - The condition `0 >= k` must be true for the print statement to execute.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `h` is 0, the condition `0 >= k` implies that `k` must be 0 or less.
   - If `k` is 0 or less, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Given the initial state and the condition, the print statement will execute and print 'YES' if `k` is 0 or less. However, since the value of `k` is not explicitly provided, we can only state that the print statement will execute if the condition `0 >= k` is true.

Output: **YES (if k is 0 or less)**
