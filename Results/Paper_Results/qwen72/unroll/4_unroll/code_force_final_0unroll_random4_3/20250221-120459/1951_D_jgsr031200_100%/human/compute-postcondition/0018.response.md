Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
- `costs` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
- `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 - k + 1` which is `1 - k`.
   - `n // (1 - k)` is `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `0` divided by any non-zero number is `0`, `0 // (1 - k)` is `0`.

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` is `0 // 1`.
   - Since `0` divided by `1` is `0`, `0 // 1` is `0`.

3. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1`.
   - Both `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1` are `0`.
   - Therefore, `h` is `0 + 0` which is `0`.

4. **Check the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`**:
   - `h` is `0`.
   - The condition `0 >= k` must be true.
   - This implies that `k` must be `0` or a negative integer.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(2)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(2)` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
