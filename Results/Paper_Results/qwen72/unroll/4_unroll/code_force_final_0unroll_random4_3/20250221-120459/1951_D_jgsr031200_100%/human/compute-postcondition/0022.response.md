Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by two '1's and returns `None`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates a series of values and prints 'YES' followed by '2' and the elements of the `costs` list if the sum of certain divisions (`h`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. In all cases, the function modifies `n` to 0 and does not return any value. **
