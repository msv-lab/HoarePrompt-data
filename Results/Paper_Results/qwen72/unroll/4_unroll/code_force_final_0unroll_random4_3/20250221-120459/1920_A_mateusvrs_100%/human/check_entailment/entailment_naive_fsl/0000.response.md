Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all the constraints as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Handling Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `ax` to a very large number and `bx` to a very small number to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`, respectively.
   - It reads the constraints and updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
3. **Checking Valid Range**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the program correctly appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.
4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the required output format.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
- When there are no constraints of type 3.
- When the range `[bx, ax]` is empty.
- When the set `cx` contains values that are outside the range `[bx, ax]`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
