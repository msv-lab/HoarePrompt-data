### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values of `k` that must be not equal to some integer.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1,000,000,007) to represent the upper bound of `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound of `k`.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - The program reads each constraint and updates the bounds and the set `cx` accordingly:
     - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`.

4. **Validation of Bounds**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If the bounds are valid (`bx <= ax`), the program initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:

- **Initialization of `ax` and `bx`**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a large number (1,000,000,007) to ensure it starts as an upper bound that can be reduced.
  - `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure it starts as a lower bound that can be increased.
  - These initializations are appropriate given the problem constraints.

- **Updating Bounds**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` and `ax` based on the type of constraint.
  - For `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `bx` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least `x`.
  - For `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `ax` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at most `x`.

- **Handling Not Equal Constraints**:
  - The program adds `x` to the set `cx` for `a == 3`, ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`.
  - Using a set for `cx` is efficient and ensures that duplicate values are not added.

- **Validation and Counting**:
  - The program correctly checks if `bx > ax` and appends 0 to `r` if this condition is true.
  - The program correctly counts the number of invalid values in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range to get the number of valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation align with the problem description and the guarantees provided.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
