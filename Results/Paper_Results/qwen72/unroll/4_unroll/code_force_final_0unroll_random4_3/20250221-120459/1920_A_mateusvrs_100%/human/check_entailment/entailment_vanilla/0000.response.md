### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values of `k` that must be not equal to some integer.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1,000,000,007) to represent the upper bound of `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound of `k`.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least `x`.
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at most `x`.
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`.

4. **Validation of Bounds**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so the program appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If the bounds are valid (`bx <= ax`), the program initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and updates the bounds `bx` and `ax` based on the type of constraint.
- It ensures that the bounds are valid before counting the number of valid integers.
- The use of a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to is appropriate, as it ensures uniqueness and efficient look-up.
- The final calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly accounts for the range of valid integers and subtracts the invalid values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints, updates the bounds, and counts the valid integers appropriately.
