Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, and then reads `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)` where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The function calculates and returns a list `r` of integers, each representing the number of valid values for `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0. The function prints each element of `r` on a new line. **
