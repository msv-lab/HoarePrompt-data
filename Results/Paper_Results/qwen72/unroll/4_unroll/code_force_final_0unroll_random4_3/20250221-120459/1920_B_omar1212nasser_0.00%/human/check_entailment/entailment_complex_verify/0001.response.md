### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good approach because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which minimizes the impact on the sum) and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1 (which maximizes the impact on the sum).

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the initial sum `s` of the array elements.
   - It also calculates the sum `n` of the last `x` elements of the array (which are the largest elements after sorting).

4. **Optimal Removals:**
   - The function `func_2` iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each possible number of removals, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest elements (since Alice wants to maximize the sum, removing the smallest elements is optimal).
   - It also updates the sum `n` by adding the next largest elements that Bob can multiply by -1 and subtracting the elements that were removed.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` includes a special case where if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, it returns 0. This is a hardcoded edge case and does not seem to be a general solution. It might be a specific test case that the author is trying to handle, but it is not a robust solution for all cases.
   - The `try`-`except` block is used to handle cases where the index might go out of bounds. This is a reasonable approach to avoid errors when the number of elements to be multiplied by -1 exceeds the length of the array.

6. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the largest elements by -1 and appends it to the list `pos`.
   - It returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Issues:
- **Hardcoded Edge Case:**
  - The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is a specific edge case and does not handle all possible inputs. This could lead to incorrect results for other inputs. For example, if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` but the array elements are such that the optimal sum is not 0, the function will return an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct in its logic for handling the game between Alice and Bob. However, the hardcoded edge case is a significant issue that could cause incorrect results for other inputs. This specific condition should be removed or replaced with a more general solution to ensure the program works correctly for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the hardcoded edge case, which does not generalize to all possible inputs. This could lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

Final: **False**
