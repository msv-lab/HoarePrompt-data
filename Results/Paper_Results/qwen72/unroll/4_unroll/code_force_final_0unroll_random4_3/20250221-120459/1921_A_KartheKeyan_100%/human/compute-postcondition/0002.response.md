The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The function should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. `n` must be greater than 0.**
