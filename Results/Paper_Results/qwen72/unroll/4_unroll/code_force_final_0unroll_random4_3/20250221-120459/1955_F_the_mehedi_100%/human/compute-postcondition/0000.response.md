The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution. The state of `func` and its parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
