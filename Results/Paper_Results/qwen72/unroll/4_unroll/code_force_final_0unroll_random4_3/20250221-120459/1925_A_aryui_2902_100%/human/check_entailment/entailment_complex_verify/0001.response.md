### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `s`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This means `s` will be of the form `abc...` repeated `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `ababc`.
   - **Subsequence Check:**
     - To check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, consider the structure of `s`.
     - The string `s` will contain each of the first `k` alphabets at least `n` times.
     - However, the way the string is constructed (repeating the first `k` characters `n` times) does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` is `ababc`. The subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc` are not all present in `s`. Specifically, `cc` cannot be formed as a subsequence from `ababc`.

4. **Optimality:**
   - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, which is not necessarily the minimum length required to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences.
   - The optimal length should be the length of the shortest string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. This is a more complex problem and typically requires a different approach, such as constructing a de Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly construct a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The length of `s` is not optimal, and it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
