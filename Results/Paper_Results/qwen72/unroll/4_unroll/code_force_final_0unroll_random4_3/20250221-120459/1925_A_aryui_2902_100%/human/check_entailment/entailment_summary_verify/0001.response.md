### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `s`.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads `n` and `k` from user input.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The function returns this constructed string `s`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This means `s` will be of the form `abc...` repeated `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `ababc`.
   - **Subsequence Check:**
     - To check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, consider the structure of `s`.
     - The string `s` will contain each of the first `k` alphabets at least `n` times.
     - However, the order in which these characters appear in `s` is important. The current construction `s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n` does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s = 'ababc'` does not contain the subsequence `cc` (which is a valid string of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets).
   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, which is not necessarily the minimum length required to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences.
     - The optimal solution should ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the shortest possible string.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly construct a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The length of `s` is not optimal, and it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment is inaccurate because the constructed string `s` does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are present. The program needs a more sophisticated approach to ensure the correct and optimal construction of the string `s`.
