The function `func` operates in an environment where a secret permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 is provided. The function does not accept any parameters directly. The function is allowed to make at most 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The goal of the function is to find and return a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, with the constraint that 0 ≤ i, j < n. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an environment with a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. It makes at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation and returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, with 0 ≤ i, j < n.**
