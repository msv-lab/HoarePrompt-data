### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The goal is to use these queries to identify the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize the XOR operation.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\), which is the length of the permutation \(p\).

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index \(v1\) of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \((p_i \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\), it updates \(v1\) to \(i\).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index \(prev\) of the element that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum value.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), it updates \(prev\) to \(i\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), it further checks \((p_i \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{prev} \mid p_{prev})\) to ensure the correct index is chosen.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - After the loops, it prints the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the answer.
   - It flushes the output after each query and the final answer to ensure the interactor receives the input correctly.

### Correctness:

- **Finding the Maximum Element**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index \(v1\) of the maximum element in the permutation. This is because \((p_i \mid p_i) = p_i\), and the loop updates \(v1\) to the index of the maximum element.

- **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index \(prev\) of the element that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum value. This is because the loop compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) and updates \(prev\) accordingly. The additional check ensures that the correct index is chosen when the OR values are equal.

- **Query Count**:
  - The program uses \(n-1\) queries in the first loop and \(n-1\) queries in the second loop, totaling \(2n-2\) queries, which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly prints the answer in the required format and flushes the output.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
