### Reasoning:

1. **func_1()**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` (the number of elements, the number of elements Alice can remove, and the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1).
   - It reads the list of `n` integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation of elements.
   - It calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - It prints the result of `func_2` for each test case.

2. **func_2(removals, negatives, elements)**:
   - This function calculates the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements`.
   - It initializes `pos` as a list to store potential sums after different numbers of removals.
   - It appends the initial sum after negating the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.
   - It iterates over the number of removals from 1 to `removals`:
     - For each removal, it updates `s` by subtracting the element at the current removal position from the end of the list.
     - It updates `s2` by subtracting the element at the current removal position from the end of the list and adding the element that is `negatives` positions before the current removal position, if it exists.
     - It appends the updated sum `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - It returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in identifying the smallest elements that can be negated by Bob and the largest elements that can be removed by Alice.
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `s` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the array.
- **Negation of Elements**: The sum `s2` is calculated as the sum of the last `negatives` elements, which are the smallest elements in the sorted array. Negating these elements minimizes the sum.
- **Removal of Elements**: The loop iterates over the number of removals, updating the sum `s` and `s2` accordingly. The expression `s - 2 * s2` accounts for the sum after removing the largest elements and negating the smallest elements.
- **Optimal Result**: The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players have played optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for both players to play optimally. Alice removes the largest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob negates the smallest elements to minimize the sum. The final result is the maximum possible sum after considering all possible removals and negations.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program meets the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. The logic for both players playing optimally is correctly implemented.
