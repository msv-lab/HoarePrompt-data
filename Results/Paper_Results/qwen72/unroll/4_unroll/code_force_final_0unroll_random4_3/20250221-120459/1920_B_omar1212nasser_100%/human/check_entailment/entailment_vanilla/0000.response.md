### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` (the number of elements, the number of elements Alice can remove, and the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively).
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in ascending order.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest elements from the array because removing the smallest elements will have the least impact on the sum.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the largest elements by -1 because this will have the greatest impact on reducing the sum.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice's and Bob's actions.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums after different numbers of removals.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It then calculates the sum of the largest `x` elements and subtracts twice this sum from `s` to simulate Bob's action of multiplying these elements by -1.
   - The function iterates over the possible number of removals from 1 to `k`:
     - For each removal, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest element (since the array is sorted, the smallest elements are at the beginning).
     - It also updates the sum `s2` of the largest `x` elements to reflect the changes due to removals.
     - It appends the new possible sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
   - It also handles the case where Bob can multiply all remaining elements by -1, which is correctly reflected in the calculations.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program sorts the array, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
   - The subsequent operations are linear, making the overall time complexity \(O(n \log n + n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
