Functionality: ** The function `func_8` accepts a list of lists `l` where each inner list has the same length. It returns a new list of lists `p` where each inner list has `m + 1` elements (where `m` is the length of the inner lists in `l`), and there are `n + 1` such inner lists (where `n` is the number of inner lists in `l`). The element `p[i][j]` in the returned list `p` represents the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1). **
