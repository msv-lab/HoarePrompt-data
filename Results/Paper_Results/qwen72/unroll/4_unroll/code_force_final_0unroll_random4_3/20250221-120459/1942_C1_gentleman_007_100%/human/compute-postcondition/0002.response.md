Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables (`num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
