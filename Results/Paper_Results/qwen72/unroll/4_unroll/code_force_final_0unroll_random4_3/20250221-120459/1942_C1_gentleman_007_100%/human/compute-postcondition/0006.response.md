The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of lists of integers. Each inner list in `l` has the same length. The dimensions of `l` are `n` (the number of inner lists) and `m` (the length of each inner list), such that `n = len(l)` and `m = len(l[0])`.

The function returns `p`, which is a list of lists of integers. Each inner list in `p` has `m + 1` elements, and there are `n + 1` such inner lists. The elements of `p` are calculated such that `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `l` where each inner list has the same length. It returns a new list of lists `p` where each inner list has one more element than the corresponding inner list in `l`, and there is one more inner list in `p` than in `l`. The element `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).**
