You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list has the same length. n and m are the dimensions of the list l, such that n = len(l) and m = len(l[0]).
def func_8(l):
    n = len(l)
    m = len(l[0])
    p = [[(0) for i in range(m + 1)] for j in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            p[i][j] = p[i - 1][j] + p[i][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j - 1] - p[i - 1][j - 1]
        
    #State: `p` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list has `m + 1` elements, and there are `n + 1` such inner lists. The elements of `p` are calculated such that `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).
    return p
    #The program returns `p`, which is a list of lists of integers. Each inner list in `p` has `m + 1` elements, and there are `n + 1` such inner lists. The elements of `p` are calculated such that `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of lists `l` where each inner list has the same length. It returns a new list of lists `p` where each inner list has one more element than the corresponding inner list in `l`, and there is one more inner list in `p` than in `l`. The element `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `p`, which is a list of lists of integers. Each inner list in `p` has `m + 1` elements, and there are `n + 1` such inner lists. The elements of `p` are calculated such that `p[i][j]` is the sum of the elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
