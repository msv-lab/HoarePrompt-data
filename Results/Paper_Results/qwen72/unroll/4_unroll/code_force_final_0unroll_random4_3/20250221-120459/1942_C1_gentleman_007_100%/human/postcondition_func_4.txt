The function `func_5` accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon and `m` is the number of edges or connections to be added, with constraints 4 <= n <= 10^9 and 0 <= m <= n. It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist `l[x]` and `l[y]` has `y` and `x` appended to them, respectively, representing the connections between the indices. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `l` contains the connections added during the function execution.
