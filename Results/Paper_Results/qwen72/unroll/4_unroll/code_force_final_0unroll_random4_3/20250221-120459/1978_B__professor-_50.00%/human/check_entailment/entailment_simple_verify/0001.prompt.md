You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The loop has finished executing t times, and the values of n, a, and b for each test case have been processed according to the conditions in the loop. The output for each test case is printed, and the values of n, a, and b are no longer retained after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The profit in this case is simply `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula \(\frac{n \cdot (2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic sequence from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function prints the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification:

- **Case 1: `b <= a`**
  - Example: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `4 * 4 = 16`
  - Actual Output: `16` (Correct)

- **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
  - Example: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Expected Output: \(\frac{5 \cdot (2 \cdot 9 - 5 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 14}{2} = 35\)
  - Actual Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
  - Example: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Expected Output: \(\frac{(5 - 10) \cdot (5 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \cdot (10 - (5 - 10)) = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} + 10 \cdot 5 = 15 + 50 = 65\)
  - Actual Output: `100` (Incorrect)

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect in the third case. The formula used in the third case is not correct. The correct formula should be:
  - \(\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\)

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - k)))
```
