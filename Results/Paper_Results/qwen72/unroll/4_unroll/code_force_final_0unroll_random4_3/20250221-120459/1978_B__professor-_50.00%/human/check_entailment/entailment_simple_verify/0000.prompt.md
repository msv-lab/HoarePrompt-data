You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The loop has finished executing t times, and the values of n, a, and b for each test case have been processed according to the conditions in the loop. The output for each test case is printed, and the values of n, a, and b are no longer retained after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` and `b - a` is odd correctly. The formula used in the `else` block is incorrect. Specifically, the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` does not correctly calculate the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers when `b - a` is odd. The correct formula should be `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2` to ensure integer division and correct summation.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 3 6
```
Here, `n = 5`, `a = 3`, and `b = 6`. The optimal choice for `k` is 3, which would result in the profit:
```
6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 21
```
However, the program calculates:
```
(6 - 3) / 2 * (6 - 3 + 1) + 3 * 5
= 1.5 * 4 + 15
= 6 + 15
= 21
```
This case happens to work, but for a different input where `b - a` is odd, the program will produce an incorrect result. For example:
```
1
4 2 5
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 2`, and `b = 5`. The optimal choice for `k` is 3, which would result in the profit:
```
5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14
```
However, the program calculates:
```
(5 - 2) / 2 * (5 - 2 + 1) + 2 * 4
= 1.5 * 4 + 8
= 6 + 8
= 14
```
This case also happens to work, but the issue is with the formula used, which can lead to incorrect results for other inputs. For instance, if `n = 4`, `a = 2`, and `b = 7`:
```
1
4 2 7
```
The optimal choice for `k` is 4, which would result in the profit:
```
7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22
```
However, the program calculates:
```
(7 - 2) / 2 * (7 - 2 + 1) + 2 * 4
= 2.5 * 6 + 8
= 15 + 8
= 23
```
This is incorrect, as the profit should be 22. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
