You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the function `func` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration, and the loop prints the minimum number of cells to color for each input pair `(n, k)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from user input, where each pair is on a new line. For each pair, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. Otherwise, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each input pair. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes without retaining any state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \):**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition. This is correct because any single cell will be part of at least one diagonal.

3. **Case for \( k \leq 2n \):**
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells along the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal. Each cell on these diagonals will cover exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti).
   - Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell covers two diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need one extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal.

4. **Case for \( k > 2n \):**
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more than \( 2n \) diagonals. The main and anti-diagonals can cover up to \( 2n \) diagonals.
   - To cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals, we need to color additional cells. Each additional cell will cover exactly two new diagonals.
   - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is used to calculate the number of cells needed. This is because:
     - \( k // 2 \) gives the number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals if each cell covers two diagonals.
     - Adding 1 ensures that we cover the remaining diagonal if \( k \) is odd.

5. **Verification of the Formula:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) is correct.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is correct because it ensures that we cover the remaining diagonals after covering \( 2n \) diagonals with the main and anti-diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and outputs the minimum number of cells needed to be colored for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
