Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored should be \( n \). However, the program prints \( n \) when \( k \) is \( 2n - 1 \), and \( n + 1 \) when \( k \) is \( 2n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 6
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \). The program will output:
```
4
```
But the correct output should be:
```
3
```
This is because when \( k = 6 \), which is exactly \( 2n \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( n \) (which is 3 in this case). The program incorrectly adds 1 to the result, leading to an incorrect output.
