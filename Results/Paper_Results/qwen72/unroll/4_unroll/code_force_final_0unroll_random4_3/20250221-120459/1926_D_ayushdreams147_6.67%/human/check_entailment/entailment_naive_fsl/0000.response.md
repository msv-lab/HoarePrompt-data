Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among the 31 least significant bits. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only checks if the number has been seen before with its 31st bit flipped, which does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from 1 to 31.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The 31 least significant bits of these numbers are:
- 1: `00000000000000000000000000000001`
- 2: `00000000000000000000000000000010`
- 3: `00000000000000000000000000000011`
- 4: `00000000000000000000000000000100`

According to the problem description, these numbers should be placed in different groups because they have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. However, the program will incorrectly place them in the same group, leading to an incorrect result.
