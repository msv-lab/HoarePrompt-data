To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is not empty, meaning it must contain at least one element. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31
- `res` is 0
- `count` is an empty dictionary

We need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Since `n` is already given to be at least 1, `a` should have at least one element. Therefore, `num` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 1 element, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
