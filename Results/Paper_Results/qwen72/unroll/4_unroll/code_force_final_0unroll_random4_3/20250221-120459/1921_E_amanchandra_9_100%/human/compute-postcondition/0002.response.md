Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing input for each test case and printing the result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') based on the conditions specified. The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not retained between iterations, and the loop does not modify any variables outside its scope. Therefore, the initial state of the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remains unchanged.**
