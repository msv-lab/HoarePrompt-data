Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged to maximize this sum. However, the program sorts the array and prints the sorted array, which does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending or descending order.
2. Compute the beauty of the array as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
3. Output the computed beauty for each test case.

The current program only sorts the array and prints it, which does not match the required output of the maximum beauty value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
