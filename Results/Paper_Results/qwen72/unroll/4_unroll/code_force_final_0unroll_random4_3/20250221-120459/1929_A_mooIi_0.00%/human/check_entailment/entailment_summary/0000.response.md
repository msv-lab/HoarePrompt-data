Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, only sorts the array and prints it, which does not compute the maximum beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program does sort the array, but it does not calculate or print the maximum beauty.

Here is the correct approach:
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element.

The provided program fails to perform the second step, and thus it does not output the correct result.

Correctness: **False**
