Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `paths` is a list of strings where each string `s` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*', and the first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty; `s` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `s` is now assigned the value 0.
