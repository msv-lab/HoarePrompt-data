The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `d` (which is not used in the function) and a string `b` representing a path. The function counts the number of '@' characters in the string `b` and stops counting if it encounters a '*' character. After processing each test case, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets the count to 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input integer `a` and the list of strings `b` (one for each test case) are consumed, and the final state of the program is that the counts of '@' characters for each test case have been printed.
