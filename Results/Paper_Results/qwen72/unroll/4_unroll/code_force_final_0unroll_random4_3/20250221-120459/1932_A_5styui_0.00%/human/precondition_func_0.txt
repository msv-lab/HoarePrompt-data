The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings paths where each string s in paths has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*' representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. The first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty.
