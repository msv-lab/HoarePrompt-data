Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to the variable `nums_left`. The value of `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`, and `nums_left` is calculated by subtracting 2 from this last element. All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, and `cur` is still `M1 - 2` with `M1` being greater than 1.
