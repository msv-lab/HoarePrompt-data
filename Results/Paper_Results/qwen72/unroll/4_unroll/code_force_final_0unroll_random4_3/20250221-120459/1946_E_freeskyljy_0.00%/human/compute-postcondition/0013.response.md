Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is assigned the value `M1 - 2`.
- The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The conditions in the initial state (such as `L[0]` being 1, `R[0]` being equal to `N`, and the relationship between the last element of `L` and the first element of `R`) remain valid.
- The condition that either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R` also remains valid.
- The value of `ans` as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` is unchanged.
