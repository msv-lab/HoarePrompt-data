The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the total number of tickets to be bought.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the `n` days.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the price per ticket on each day and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each day. It returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days.**
