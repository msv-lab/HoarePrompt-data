Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the `n` days. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
