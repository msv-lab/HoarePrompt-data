#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v, representing the edges of a tree with exactly two leaves, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node of the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: tree is a defaultdict(list) where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u by an edge, and the initial variables n, edges, and start remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree with exactly two leaves), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and identifies the two leaf nodes. The function then calculates the distances from the starting node to each of the leaf nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. If either of these distances is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters.
