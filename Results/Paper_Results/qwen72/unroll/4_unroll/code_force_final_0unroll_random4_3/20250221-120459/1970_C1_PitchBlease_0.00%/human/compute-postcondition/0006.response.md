Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict(list) where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u by an edge, `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in `tree`, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function, and either `dist1` or `dist2` is even.**
