The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is non-empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` already contains one element, it is non-empty, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and `tree` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the tree, with each key or index corresponding to a node and the value being a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
