Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

While the actual output matches the expected output for the given test cases, the logic in the program is flawed. The program always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and 3 otherwise. This is not a correct approach because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party in all cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints 3 instead of 2. The correct approach would be to find the smallest set of friends such that at least 2 friends can attend the party, which can be done by identifying cycles or pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. The program does not handle this correctly.
