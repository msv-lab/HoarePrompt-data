Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case. This is correct based on the problem description.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The function checks if both `a` and `b` are odd using the condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, as any cut will result in non-integer dimensions. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Exact Half Check**: The function checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other using the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`. If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the only possible cuts will result in two identical rectangles, and no new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, but these cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

4. **Other Cases**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if at least one dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and by rearranging these, he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.

5. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The problem description mentions that the output can be in any case (upper or lower). The function uses 'NO' and 'YES' in uppercase, which is acceptable.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and outputs the correct results for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
