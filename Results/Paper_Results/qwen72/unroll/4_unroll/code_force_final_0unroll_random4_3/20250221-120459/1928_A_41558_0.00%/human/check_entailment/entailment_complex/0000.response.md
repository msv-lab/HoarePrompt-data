Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will always result in non-integer side lengths, which is not allowed.
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other (i.e., `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`), Bob cannot form another rectangle because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original one when combined in any orientation.
   - In all other cases, Bob can form another rectangle.

3. **Output**: The function prints "NO" if either of the above conditions is met, and "YES" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive, so "NO" and "YES" are acceptable.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where both dimensions are 1 (e.g., `1 1`), which is a valid input and should result in "NO".
   - The function correctly handles cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other (e.g., `2 1`), which should also result in "NO".
   - The function correctly handles cases where both dimensions are even or one is even and the other is odd, which should result in "YES" (e.g., `2 6`, `3 2`, `2 2`, `2 4`).

5. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The conditions are logically sound and cover all possible scenarios for the given problem.

6. **Performance**:
   - The function is efficient and should handle the maximum input size (up to \(10^4\) test cases) within reasonable time and space constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
