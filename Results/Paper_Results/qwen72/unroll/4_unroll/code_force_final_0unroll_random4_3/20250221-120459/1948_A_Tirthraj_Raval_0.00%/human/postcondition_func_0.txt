The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a pattern string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
