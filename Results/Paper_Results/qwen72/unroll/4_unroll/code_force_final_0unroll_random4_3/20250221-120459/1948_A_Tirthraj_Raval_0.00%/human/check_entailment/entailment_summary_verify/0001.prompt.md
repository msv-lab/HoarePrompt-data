You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a pattern string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB').

3. **Even `n` Check**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern of length `n` by alternating between 'A' and 'B'. The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times, appending two characters in each iteration:
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends 'A' or 'B' based on the parity of `i`.
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends the opposite character ('B' if the previous was 'A', and vice versa).

4. **Pattern Construction**:
   - The pattern construction ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which satisfies the condition for special characters.
   - The pattern is then joined into a single string and printed.

5. **Output Length**:
   - The length of the constructed string is `n`, which is at most 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the possibility of constructing a valid string, and constructs the string as required. The output is also within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
