The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. If `n - 1` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` will be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0, `n - 1` must be greater than 0**
