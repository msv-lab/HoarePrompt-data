Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of n, f, k, and a are reset for each iteration, so they do not retain any specific values from the previous iterations. The loop prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
