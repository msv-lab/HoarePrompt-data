Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**

The value of `t` is updated to an input integer provided by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 1000. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
