You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m

    #State: The loop reads `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` from the input, and for each pair, it prints a value calculated based on the given logic. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged, but the internal variables `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `a` are reset or modified within each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd numbers, then the numbers that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` which is intended to store the counts of cards laid down in each step.
   - The while loop is supposed to calculate the number of cards laid down in each step, but it does not append any values to `L`, and it does not correctly handle the logic for laying down cards.
   - The `tot` variable is initialized to 0, which is used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The `pow` variable is initialized to 1, which is used to keep track of the current multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L`, which is always empty, so the loop never runs.
   - The program attempts to print the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, but this formula is not correct for the problem's requirements.

3. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The while loop does not correctly populate the list `L` with the counts of cards laid down in each step.
   - The for loop is not necessary and will never run because `L` is always empty.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is incorrect for determining the k-th card laid down.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the number of cards laid down in each step (odd numbers, twice odd numbers, etc.) and keeping track of the cumulative count.
   - For each step, the number of cards laid down is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - Once the cumulative count exceeds or equals `k`, the k-th card can be determined by the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

### Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the k-th card laid down. It fails to populate the list `L` with the counts of cards laid down in each step, and the formula used to determine the k-th card is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
