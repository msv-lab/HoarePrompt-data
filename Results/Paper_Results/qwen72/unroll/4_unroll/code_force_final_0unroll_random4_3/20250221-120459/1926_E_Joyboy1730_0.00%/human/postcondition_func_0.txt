The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. The function then performs a series of calculations and prints a value for each test case based on the logic defined within the loop. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged, but the internal variables `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `a` are reset or modified within each iteration of the loop.
