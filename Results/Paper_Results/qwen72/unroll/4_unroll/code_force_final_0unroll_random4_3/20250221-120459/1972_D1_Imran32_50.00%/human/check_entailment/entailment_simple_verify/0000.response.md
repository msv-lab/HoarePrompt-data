### Reasoning

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the input. However, the variable \(k\) is not used in the function, which suggests a potential issue.
   - The program initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It iterates from 2 to `root` inclusive, and for each \(i\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **State before function call**: The function should take two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) as inputs.
   - **State inside function**:
     - \(n\) and \(k\) are read, but \(k\) is not used.
     - `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
     - `root` is calculated as \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\).
     - The loop iterates from 2 to `root` inclusive, and for each \(i\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - **State after function call**: `ans` is printed, which is the value of \(n\) plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to `root` inclusive.

4. **Validation of Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The program does not implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it calculates a different value, which is not aligned with the problem statement.
   - For example, for the input `2 3`, the correct output should be `3` (pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2)), but the program will not produce this output.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.
   - The original assessment is accurate.
