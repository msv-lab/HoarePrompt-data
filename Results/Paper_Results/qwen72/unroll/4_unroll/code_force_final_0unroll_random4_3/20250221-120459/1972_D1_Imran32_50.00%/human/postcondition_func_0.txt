The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It calculates a new value `ans` by starting with `n` and adding the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The function then prints the final value of `ans`. The input variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value.
