The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `grid`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The `grid` contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The function returns the type of the shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `grid`. It returns 'triangle' if a triangle is found in the grid, and 'square' if a square is found in the grid.**
