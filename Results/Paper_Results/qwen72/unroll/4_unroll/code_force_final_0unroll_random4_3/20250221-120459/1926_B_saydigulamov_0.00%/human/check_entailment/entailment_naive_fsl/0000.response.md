Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks the count of '1's in the first two rows and prints the list of counts if they are equal, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
3
000
011
011
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SQUARE
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[2, 2]
[1, 3]
```

The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description. Instead, it prints the counts of '1's in the rows where '1's are found. This clearly indicates that the program is not following the problem description and is incorrect.
