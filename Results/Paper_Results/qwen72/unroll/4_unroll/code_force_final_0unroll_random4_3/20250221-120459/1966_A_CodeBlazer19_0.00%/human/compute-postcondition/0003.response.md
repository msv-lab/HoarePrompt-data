The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `k`. The list `numbers` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each element `c_i` in `numbers` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The integer `k` should be between 2 and 100 (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `k`. It returns the result of performing operations that exchange `k` cards in the list, with the specific output depending on the operation logic.**
