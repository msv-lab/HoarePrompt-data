To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation.
- `t` is an input integer.

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`numbers`, `k`, and `n`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
