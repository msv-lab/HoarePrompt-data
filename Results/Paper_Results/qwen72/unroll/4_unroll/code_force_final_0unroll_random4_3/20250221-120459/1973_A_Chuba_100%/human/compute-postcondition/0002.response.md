Output State: The function will have printed the result or -1 for each set of inputs provided in the `t` iterations. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop variable `_` will have completed all its iterations from 0 to `t-1`. 

The output state for each iteration is determined by the input values provided during that iteration. If the sum of the input values is odd, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the provided formula.
