The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must be greater than 0. This means that the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts describes the input parameters for the function, but the loop itself only depends on the input value for the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1, as this will generate a range of at least one iteration. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and must be greater than 0**
