Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes the matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It calculates the value `res` as the sum of \( (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - It prints `res` and \( 2n \) (which is `n << 1`).
   - For each value of \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it prints two lines:
     - The first line starts with '1' followed by \( i \) and the range from 1 to \( n \).
     - The second line starts with '2' followed by \( i \) and the range from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Correctness**:
   - **Sum Calculation**:
     - The sum `res` is calculated as \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
     - This formula is derived from the fact that each element in the matrix will be a value from 1 to \( n \), and the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values.
     - The sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
     - However, the program uses a different formula to calculate `res`, which is \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
     - This formula does not match the expected sum of the matrix elements, which should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

   - **Operations**:
     - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
     - Each operation is a valid Type 1 or Type 2 operation, using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum calculation `res` is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The operations are correct and within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation.

Correctness: **False**
