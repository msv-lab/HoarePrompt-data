### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment to understand if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- We can perform up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either:
  - Set the entire \( i \)-th row to a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
  - Set the entire \( i \)-th column to a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with \( n \) rows, each containing the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `res` is initialized to 0.
   - The sum `res` is calculated as the sum of \( (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `res` and \( 2n \) (which is `n << 1`).
   - For each \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it prints two operations:
     - Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect for \( n = 1 \).
- For \( n = 1 \), the maximum sum is 1, and it should be achieved with a single operation.
- The program outputs `1 2` and two operations, which is more than necessary.

#### Verification:
1. **Sum Calculation for \( n = 1 \):**
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum `res` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{res} = (0 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) = 1 \times 1 = 1
     \]
   - This is correct.

2. **Number of Operations for \( n = 1 \):**
   - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \).
   - This is incorrect because the problem specifies that the maximum sum can be achieved with no more than \( 2n \) operations, but it does not imply that \( 2n \) operations are always necessary. For \( n = 1 \), only 1 operation is needed.

3. **Operations for \( n = 1 \):**
   - The program prints:
     ```
     1 1 1
     2 1 1
     ```
   - This is more than necessary. The correct output should be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 1 1
     ```

4. **General Case:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), the program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The operations are valid permutations and will fill the matrix with the maximum possible values.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum sum for any \( n \).
- However, it incorrectly prints more operations than necessary for \( n = 1 \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case \( n = 1 \) optimally, printing more operations than necessary. For \( n = 1 \), the correct output should be `1 1` followed by a single operation.
