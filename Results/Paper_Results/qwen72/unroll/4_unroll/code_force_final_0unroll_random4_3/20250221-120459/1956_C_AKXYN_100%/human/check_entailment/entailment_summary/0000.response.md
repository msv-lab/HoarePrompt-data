Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - For each \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it prints two operations: one for the row and one for the column, both using the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Verification of the Formula**:
   - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - Let's break it down:
     - For \( n = 1 \):
       - \( \sum_{i=0}^{0} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
     - For \( n = 2 \):
       - \( \sum_{i=0}^{1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) = 1 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 = 1 + 6 = 7 \)
   - This matches the expected maximum sums for the given examples.

4. **Verification of Operations**:
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each operation sets a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), which is valid according to the problem description.
   - The operations are printed in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest case \( n = 1 \) correctly by setting \( a_{1,1} = 1 \) and printing the sum as 1.
   - For larger \( n \), the program correctly calculates the sum and prints the operations.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each test case in \( O(n) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints \( 1 \le n \le 500 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by maximizing the sum of the matrix elements and ensuring the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

Correctness: **True**
