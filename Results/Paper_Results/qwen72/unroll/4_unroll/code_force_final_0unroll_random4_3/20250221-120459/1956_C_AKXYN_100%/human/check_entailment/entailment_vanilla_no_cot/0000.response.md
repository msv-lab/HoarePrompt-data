Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with each row being a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to `n` repeated `n` times. The sum of the first `n` integers is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), and each integer appears `n` times in the matrix, so the total sum is \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

4. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations, which is `2n` (i.e., `n << 1`).

5. **Operations**: The program then outputs `2n` operations:
   - For each `i` from `n` to 1, it performs a Type 1 operation on row `i` using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For each `i` from `n` to 1, it performs a Type 2 operation on column `i` using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This approach ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, and the number of operations does not exceed `2n`, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
