The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the size of the matrix `n`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It returns a result for each test case based on the size of the matrix.**
