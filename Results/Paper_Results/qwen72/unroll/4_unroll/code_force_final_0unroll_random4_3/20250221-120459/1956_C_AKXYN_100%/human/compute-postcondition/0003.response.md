Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It calculates a value `res` as the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and prints `res` followed by `2 * n`. Additionally, for each value of i from n down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starts with '1' followed by i and the range from 1 to n, and the second line starts with '2' followed by i and the range from 1 to n. The function does not return any values, but it processes and prints results for each test case. **
