You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The number of test cases t is also an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]

            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations for each of the t test cases. For each test case, the variable `res` holds the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value `n << 1` (which is 2 * n) is printed alongside `res`. Additionally, for each value of i from n down to 1, two lines are printed: the first line starts with '1' followed by i and the range from 1 to n, and the second line starts with '2' followed by i and the range from 1 to n. The variables `t` and `n` retain their values as they were at the start of each test case, but the loop has completed its execution for all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \), then assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \), then assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Each element in the matrix can be set to a value between 1 and \( n \). To maximize the sum, we should use the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column operation.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Sum**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be calculated as follows:
     - For each row, the sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
     - Since we have \( n \) rows, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program uses \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row.
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - However, the program still outputs the correct number of operations and the correct operations themselves, which will fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations, ensuring that each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the incorrect formula for calculating the maximum sum, the operations performed by the program are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
   - The number of operations is within the allowed limit.
