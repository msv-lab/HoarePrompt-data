### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Total Durability**:
   - The function first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`). If so, it returns `n`, which is correct because all ships will be sunk if the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships.

2. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - The function calculates two thresholds: `a` (ceiling of `k / 2`) and `b` (integer division of `k` by 2). This is intended to simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships. However, this approach is flawed.

3. **Loop to Count Sunk Ships**:
   - The loop iterates through the list `nums` and accumulates the durabilities of the first and last ships (`s_a` and `s_b`). It increments `ans` if the accumulated durability of the first ship (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` or if the accumulated durability of the last ship (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b`.
   - The logic here is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the alternating attacks and the removal of sunk ships. The function simply counts how many ships have a durability less than or equal to `a` or `b`, which does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `n=4`, `k=5`, and `nums=[1, 2, 4, 3]`:
     - The function should return 2 because the first and last ships are sunk after 5 attacks.
     - However, the function's logic will count the number of ships with durability less than or equal to `a` and `b`, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the removal of sunk ships. It simply counts the number of ships with durability less than or equal to `a` and `b`, which is not the intended behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
