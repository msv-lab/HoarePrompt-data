The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. 

Case_1: The function returns the positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.

Case_2: The function returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the number of elements in `nums` if the first case is met. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, counted from the end of the list.**
