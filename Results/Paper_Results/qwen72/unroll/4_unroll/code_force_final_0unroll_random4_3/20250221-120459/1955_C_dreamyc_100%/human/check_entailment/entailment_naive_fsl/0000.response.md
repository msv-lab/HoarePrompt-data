Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships in the specified alternating order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and the ships' durability is reduced accordingly. The function `func_1` incorrectly sums the durability of the ships and checks against the number of attacks, which does not simulate the actual attack pattern described in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output `3` because it incorrectly counts the number of ships that could be sunk based on the sum of their durability and the number of attacks, rather than simulating the attack sequence.

The correct approach would involve simulating the attack sequence by using a queue or deque to manage the ships and their durability, and decrementing the durability of the ships in the specified order until the number of attacks is exhausted or all ships have sunk.
