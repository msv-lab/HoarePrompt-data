Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The logic in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed to exchange all `n` cards for `k-1` cards, so the minimum number of cards is `k-1`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k` for each card number. This is because if a card number appears more than `k` times, it can be used in multiple operations, but the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation is `k`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if any card number appears exactly `k` times in the frequency table. If it does, it means you can perform an operation to exchange these `k` cards for `k-1` cards, and the minimum number of cards left is `k-1`.
   - If no card number appears exactly `k` times, the program assumes that no operations can be performed, and the minimum number of cards left is `n`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the main logic. The program should consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards. Specifically, if a card number appears more than `k` times, it can be used in multiple operations to reduce the total number of cards. The current logic does not account for this, and it incorrectly assumes that if no card number appears exactly `k` times, no operations can be performed.

To fix this, the program should calculate the minimum number of cards left by considering the total number of cards that can be exchanged in multiple operations. This can be done by summing the frequencies of all card numbers and then applying the operation logic to reduce the total number of cards.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct minimum number of cards for all test cases.
