### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, no operations can be performed, and the minimum number of cards left is `n`. This is correct.
   - The program also checks if `k` is equal to `n`. If so, one operation can be performed to reduce the number of cards to `k-1`. This is also correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - The function ensures that no frequency exceeds `k` by setting any frequency greater than `k` to `k`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to simply count the frequencies without any capping.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `freq` dictionary is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k-1` because one operation can be performed to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n`, which is incorrect. The program should instead calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

### Analysis of the Final Check:
- The logic in the final check is flawed. The program should not print `n` if no frequency is exactly `k`. Instead, it should determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
- The correct approach would be to calculate the total number of cards that can be removed by repeatedly performing the operation on groups of cards with frequencies greater than or equal to `k`.
- For each card number with a frequency `f`:
  - If `f` is a multiple of `k`, all `f` cards can be removed.
  - If `f` is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining cards after performing the operation as many times as possible will be `f % k`.
- The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders for all card numbers.

### Conclusion:
- The program's final check is incorrect, and it does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
- The suggested fix in the original assessment is correct and should be applied.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

This fix correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
