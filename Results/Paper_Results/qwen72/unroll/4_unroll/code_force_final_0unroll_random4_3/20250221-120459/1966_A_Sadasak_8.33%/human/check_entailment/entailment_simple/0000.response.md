Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. However, the logic in the main part of the program and the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **k > n**: If `k` is greater than `n`, no operations can be performed, so the number of cards remains `n`. This is correctly handled.
   - **k == n**: If `k` is equal to `n`, you can perform one operation to reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`. This is also correctly handled.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of card numbers, but the frequency table is capped at `k` for each number. This is incorrect because the frequency of a number can be more than `k`, and the program should consider the actual frequency.
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`. The correct logic should be to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations, which involves more complex calculations.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly builds a frequency table but caps the frequency at `k` for each number. This is incorrect because the actual frequency of a number can be more than `k`, and the program should use the actual frequency to determine the minimum number of cards left.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the frequency of each card number and then determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The key is to use the frequency to calculate how many operations can be performed and how many cards will remain.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
