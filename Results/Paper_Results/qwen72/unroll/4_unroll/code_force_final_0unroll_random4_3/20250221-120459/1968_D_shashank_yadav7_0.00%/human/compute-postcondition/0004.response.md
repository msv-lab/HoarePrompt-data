Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it simulates a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation `p` and collect scores based on the values in array `a`. The function updates the positions and scores of the players over `k` turns and then determines the winner by comparing their final scores. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state is the set of printed results for each test case. **
