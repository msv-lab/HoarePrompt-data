Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the logic within the `while` loop does not correctly account for the total number of games played and the distribution of points that can result from draws and wins/losses. Here is a more detailed explanation:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points (sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`) is even. This is necessary because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program correctly prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two lower-scoring players have all their points from draws.
   - However, the logic for the case where `p3 < p1 + p2` is flawed. The `while` loop attempts to find a balance between `x` and `y` but does not correctly handle the distribution of points.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points distribution is consistent with the rules of the game. Specifically, the maximum number of draws is the maximum value of `d` such that the points can be distributed as `2g - d` wins and `d` draws, where `g` is the total number of games.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p1 + p2, total_games)
        if p3 - max_draws > total_games - max_draws:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points Check**: Ensures the total points are even.
- **Total Games Calculation**: The total number of games is half the total points.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `p1 + p2` and `total_games`. This ensures that the draws do not exceed the total number of games.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensures that the points distribution is consistent with the rules of the game. Specifically, the highest score `p3` should not exceed the total points from wins and draws.

This corrected version should handle all the test cases correctly.
