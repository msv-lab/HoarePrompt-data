Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2` is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
8
```

**Explanation:**
- The total points are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which is even, so the scores are potentially valid.
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by distributing the points in such a way that the total number of draws is maximized. In this case, the maximum number of draws is 6, which can be achieved if all games ended in draws.

However, the program outputs 8, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is not handling this case correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
