Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. It then prints a result based on the following conditions: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it adjusts the scores by decrementing `p3` and incrementing `p1` until a condition is met, and prints the adjusted sum of `p1` and `p3`. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it prints `p3`. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not modified outside the loop. **
