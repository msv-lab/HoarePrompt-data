The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that the function takes three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. This state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as input, where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. `t` is an input integer.**
