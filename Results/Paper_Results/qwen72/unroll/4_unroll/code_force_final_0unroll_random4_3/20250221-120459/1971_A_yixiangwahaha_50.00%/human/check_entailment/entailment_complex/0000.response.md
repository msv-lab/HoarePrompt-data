Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `t` which is supposed to represent the number of test cases. However, the program does not use `t` in any way. Instead, it always reads 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should be dynamic based on the input `t`.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The program uses a fixed loop that iterates 10 times to read the pairs of integers. This is incorrect because the number of iterations should be based on the value of `t`.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers. However, due to the incorrect handling of the number of test cases, it will always print 10 pairs, even if `t` is less than 10 or more than 10. This is a logical error.

4. **Functionality**: The function `func` does not accept any parameters, which is fine for this problem. However, it should handle the number of test cases dynamically based on the input `t`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
