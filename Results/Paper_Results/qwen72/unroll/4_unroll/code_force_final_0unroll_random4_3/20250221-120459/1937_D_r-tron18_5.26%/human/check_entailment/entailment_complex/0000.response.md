### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the cell's character and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - It is used to compute the difference between the cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters in the grid.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the cumulative sums and calculating the time for each cell.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in the string.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices in `pre`, with an initial 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0 to keep track of the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0 to store the results.

   - **Iteration**:
     - The function iterates over the string `s1` from the last character to the first.
     - For each character:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

   - **Time Calculation**:
     - The time calculation involves comparing the cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters.
     - The function uses `func_1` to compute these differences and adjusts the time based on the current state of the grid.

   - **Final State**:
     - After processing all characters, `s1` remains unchanged.
     - `totalOne` is 0 because all '>' characters have been processed.
     - `preOne` is empty because all elements have been popped.
     - `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of all '<' characters, plus the initial 0.
     - The list `ans` contains the calculated times for each cell.

5. **Validation**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the movement and time calculation for the pinball based on the problem description.
   - The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function ensures that the time calculations are efficient and accurate.
   - The function processes each test case independently and prints the results for each cell.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell, as described in the problem. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate. The final state of the program is as expected, and the results are printed correctly for each test case.
