Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
3
>><
```

### Expected Output:
```
3 2 1
```

### Actual Output:
The program will produce an incorrect output. The logic in `func_2` does not correctly account for the movement and inversion of the pinball, leading to incorrect results.

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
- For the first cell (index 0), the pinball moves right to the second cell (index 1), then left to the first cell (index 0), and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 3 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1), the pinball moves left to the first cell (index 0) and then left to leave the grid. This takes 2 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2), the pinball moves left to the second cell (index 1) and then left to leave the grid. This takes 1 second.

The program's logic for calculating these movements and inversions is not correct, leading to the incorrect output.
