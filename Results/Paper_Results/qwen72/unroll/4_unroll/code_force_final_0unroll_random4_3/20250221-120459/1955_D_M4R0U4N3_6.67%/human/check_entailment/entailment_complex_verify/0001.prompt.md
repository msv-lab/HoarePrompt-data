You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the lists `a` and `b` to determine the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in `b`. The variable `ans` holds the count of such valid subarrays for each test case, and it is printed after each iteration. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset at the beginning of each iteration, so their values are not carried over between test cases. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the output of the program will be the printed values of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in the set `todo`, which is derived from user input. The function prints the count of such valid subarrays for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution, but the output of the program will be the printed values of `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is a set containing the elements of array `b`.
   - `done` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that match elements in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.
   - `extra` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that are not in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.

3. **First Subsegment**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - If an element from `a` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element from `a` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]`, it updates the sets by removing the element `a[r-m]` (the element that is no longer part of the current subsegment) and adding the new element `a[r]`.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the initialization of the first subsegment.
- It correctly updates the sets as it slides the window over the array `a`.
- The logic for counting good subsegments is sound and follows the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, which is efficient for the operations it performs (add, remove, and check membership).
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the subsegment length `m` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it implements.

### Correctness:
**True**
