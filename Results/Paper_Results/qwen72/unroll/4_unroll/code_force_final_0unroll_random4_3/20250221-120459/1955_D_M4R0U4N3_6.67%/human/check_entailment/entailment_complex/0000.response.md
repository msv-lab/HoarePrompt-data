### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `todo` as a set containing all elements of `b`.
   - It also initializes `done` and `extra` as empty sets to keep track of elements that have been matched and those that have not, respectively.

3. **First Subsegment Check:**
   - The function checks the first subsegment of length `m` in `a` by iterating over the first `m` elements.
   - If an element in `a` is in `todo`, it is moved to `done` and removed from `todo`.
   - If an element in `a` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - The initial count `ans` is set to 1 if the number of matched elements (`len(done)`) is at least `k`, otherwise it is set to 0.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent subsegments of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`:
     - If the element being removed from the window (`old`) is in `extra`, it is simply removed from `extra`.
     - If the element being removed from the window (`old`) is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - If the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved to `done` and removed from `todo`.
     - If the new element `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - The function increments `ans` if the number of matched elements (`len(done)`) is at least `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, the function prints the count `ans` of good subsegments.
   - The function then moves on to the next test case.

### Correctness:

The function correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subsegments in `a` for each test case. It ensures that the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated correctly as the window slides over the array. The logic for determining if a subsegment is good is also correct, as it checks if the number of matched elements is at least `k`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
