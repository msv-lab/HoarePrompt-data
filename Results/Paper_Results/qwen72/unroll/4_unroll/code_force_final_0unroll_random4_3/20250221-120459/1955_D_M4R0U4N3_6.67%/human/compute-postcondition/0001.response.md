Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the lists `a` and `b` to determine the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in `b`. The variable `ans` holds the count of such valid subarrays for each test case, and it is printed after each iteration. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset at the beginning of each iteration, so their values are not carried over between test cases. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the output of the program will be the printed values of `ans` for each test case.**
