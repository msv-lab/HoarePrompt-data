Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a binary string `s` from the input. It then calculates the number of transitions between different bits in `s` (i.e., '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'). If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', it prints the number of transitions plus one; otherwise, it prints the number of transitions. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
