Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and represent the range of indices in the arrays `arr` and `cliques`. `clique` is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the vertices in the specified range. `small_element` is `left + 1`. `big_element` is `right + 1`.**

The code snippet assigns the value `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` <= `right`, and that `small_element` is `left + 1`, are still valid.
