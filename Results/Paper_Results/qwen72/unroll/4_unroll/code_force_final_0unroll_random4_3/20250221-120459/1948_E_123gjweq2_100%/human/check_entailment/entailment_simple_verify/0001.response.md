### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to the vertices of a graph and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining the clique for each vertex.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This correctly calculates the number of cliques needed. Each clique can cover up to \( k \) vertices, so dividing \( n \) by \( k \) and taking the ceiling gives the minimum number of cliques.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques, calling `make_array` for each clique to assign values and determine the clique for the vertices.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables represent the smallest and largest values to be assigned in the current segment.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the segment.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements not in the midpoint.
   - The first loop assigns the smallest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop assigns the largest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is implicitly handled by the way the values are assigned in `make_array`. By assigning values in a specific pattern, the program ensures that the edge condition is satisfied for the vertices within each clique.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the `cliquess` array. The array `cliquess` is not being updated correctly in the `make_array` function. The annotations show that `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros, which is incorrect.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial State**:
  - `n` and `k` are valid integers within the specified range.
  - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to lists of `n` zeros.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This correctly calculates the number of cliques.
  - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized correctly.
  - The loop iterates over the number of cliques, calling `make_array` with the appropriate parameters.

- **Function `make_array`**:
  - `small_element` and `big_element` are correctly calculated.
  - `mid` and `not_mid` are correctly calculated.
  - The first loop assigns values to `arr` correctly, but it also updates `cliquess` for the first half of the segment.
  - The second loop assigns values to `arr` correctly, but it also updates `cliquess` for the second half of the segment.

- **Output State**:
  - `print(*arr)`: This prints the assigned values, which are distinct and within the range 1 to \( n \).
  - `print(cliques)`: This prints the number of cliques, which is correct.
  - `print(*cliquess)`: This should print the clique assignments, but the annotations show that `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros. This is incorrect because `cliquess` should be updated in `make_array` to reflect the clique assignments.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the number of cliques and assigns values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. However, the `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect clique assignments being printed.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to update the `cliquess` array properly, resulting in incorrect clique assignments being printed. This is a critical flaw that affects the correctness of the solution.
