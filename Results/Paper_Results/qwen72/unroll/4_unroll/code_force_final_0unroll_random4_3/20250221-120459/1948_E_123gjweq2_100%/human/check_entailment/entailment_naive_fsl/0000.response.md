Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k \) is larger than \( n \). According to the problem description, \( k \) can be up to \( 2n \). However, the function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which will always be 1 when \( k \geq n \). This means that the program will always try to form a single clique, regardless of the value of \( k \), which is not necessarily the correct approach.

For example, consider the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \). The expected output should be a single clique, but the program will not correctly form the cliques because it does not handle the edge case where \( k \) is very large relative to \( n \). The function `make_array` will be called with `left = 0`, `right = 7`, and `clique = 1`, but the logic inside `make_array` will not correctly assign the elements to form a valid clique.

To verify this, let's run the program with the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique

# Test case
func_1(8, 16)
```

The output will be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is very large, leading to incorrect partitioning of the graph into cliques. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
