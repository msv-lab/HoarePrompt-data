### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to \( n \) vertices.
   - We need to add edges between vertices \( i \) and \( j \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as \( \text{ceil}(n / k) \).
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length \( n \).
   - It then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate range and clique number.
   - After all calls to `make_array`, it prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function is responsible for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a specific range of indices.
   - It divides the range into two parts: one for smaller elements and one for larger elements.
   - It fills the `arr` array with a sequence of integers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`.
   - It sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the given `clique` number.

4. **Edge Addition Condition**:
   - The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) ensures that vertices are connected if they are close enough in both their indices and the assigned values.
   - The way `make_array` fills the `arr` array ensures that the values are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of edges within each clique.

5. **Clique Partition**:
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques by dividing the vertices into segments of length \( k \).
   - Each segment is filled with a unique value, ensuring that vertices within the same segment form a clique.

6. **Output**:
   - The `arr` array is printed, which contains the assigned values to the vertices.
   - The number of cliques is printed.
   - The `cliquess` array is printed, which contains the clique number for each vertex.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cliques and divides the vertices into segments.
- The function `make_array` correctly fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays to ensure that the vertices within each segment form a clique.
- The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied by the way the values are assigned in `make_array`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
