### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices \( i \) and \( j \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining the clique for each vertex.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques needed. The idea is that each clique can cover up to \( k \) vertices.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques, calling `make_array` for each clique to assign values and determine the clique for the vertices.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables represent the smallest and largest values to be assigned in the current segment.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the segment.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements not in the midpoint.
   - The first loop assigns the smallest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop assigns the largest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is implicitly handled by the way the values are assigned in `make_array`. By assigning values in a specific pattern, the program ensures that the edge condition is satisfied for the vertices within each clique.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Validation**:
   - **Distinct Values**: The values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range 1 to \( n \). This is ensured by the way `make_array` assigns values.
   - **Clique Assignments**: Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique, as `make_array` assigns the same clique number to all vertices in the current segment.
   - **Edge Condition**: The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied within each clique because the values are assigned in a way that minimizes the difference between \( a_i \) and \( a_j \) for vertices \( i \) and \( j \) within the same segment.

8. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state and behavior of the program.
   - The `cliquess` array is correctly updated to reflect the clique assignments.
   - The `arr` array is correctly updated to reflect the assigned values.
   - The number of cliques is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem by assigning values to vertices in a way that ensures the edge condition is met and by partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques. The logic in `make_array` ensures that the values are assigned in a pattern that satisfies the edge condition, and the overall structure of `func_1` ensures that the graph is partitioned correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
