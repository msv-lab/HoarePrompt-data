### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined without parameters, but it reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) within the function itself. This is appropriate for the problem since the function is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases.

2. **Input Reading**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b` respectively, and then reads the strings `a` and `b`. This matches the problem's input format.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `k` and `j` are initialized to 0. `k` will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to track the position in `b`.

4. **Loop through `a`**: The function iterates through each character in `a` using the index `i`.

5. **Finding Matches in `b`**: For each character `a[i]`, the function uses a while loop to find the next matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`. If a match is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position. If no match is found, the loop breaks, and the function moves to the next test case.

6. **Output**: The function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

7. **Return Statement**: The function includes a `return` statement, but it does not return any value. This is not necessary and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. The input and output handling is also correct, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
