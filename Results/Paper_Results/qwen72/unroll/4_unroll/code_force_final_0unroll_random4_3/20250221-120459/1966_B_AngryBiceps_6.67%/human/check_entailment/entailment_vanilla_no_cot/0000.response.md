Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. The program checks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing the allowed operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid, followed by the grid itself.

2. **Grid Analysis**:
   - **First Row and Last Row Check**: The program constructs the first row and the last row of the grid by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
   - **Single Row Check**: It checks if the first row of the grid is all the same color (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and if the first row is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`). If this condition is true, it prints "NO" because it would be impossible to make all squares the same color if the first row is already uniform but different from the last row.
   - **First Column and Last Column Check**: Similarly, it checks if the first column (constructed from the first characters of each row) is all the same color (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and if the first column is different from the last column (constructed from the last characters of each row). If this condition is true, it also prints "NO" for the same reason as above.

3. **Output**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES" because it is possible to make all squares the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles for the operations.

The logic is sound and covers the necessary conditions to determine if the grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.
