#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described but lacks the necessary parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the grid and its dimensions, such as `def func(t, n, m, grid):`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid, and `grid` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid, with each string containing 'W' and 'B' characters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and checks if the first row or the first and last columns are entirely the same character ('W' or 'B') but differ from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of a grid, and then reads `n` rows of the grid, where each row is a string of 'W' and 'B' characters. It checks if the first row or the first and last columns are entirely the same character ('W' or 'B') but differ from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output.
