Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem by checking specific conditions that determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the approach:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` should take parameters for the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the grid itself. The current implementation reads these values from standard input directly, which is not ideal for testing and reusability. However, this is a common practice in competitive programming, so it's not necessarily incorrect in that context.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The function checks if the first row is entirely the same character (`'W'` or `'B'`) and if it differs from the last row. If this condition is met, it prints `'NO'`.
   - The function also checks if the first column (formed by the first character of each row) is entirely the same character and if it differs from the last column (formed by the last character of each row). If this condition is met, it prints `'NO'`.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints `'YES'`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The first condition (`if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`) checks if the first row is uniform but different from the last row. This is a valid condition to print `'NO'` because if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, there is no way to make the entire grid uniform.
   - The second condition (`elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`) checks if the first column is uniform but different from the last column. This is also a valid condition to print `'NO'` for the same reason.
   - However, the function does not check if the entire grid can be made uniform if neither of the above conditions is met. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are not uniform but the grid can still be made uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles. The function will print `'YES'` in such cases, which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the grid is already uniform (e.g., all 'W' or all 'B').
   - The function correctly handles the case where the grid is 1x1, which is trivially uniform.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where the grid is 1x1 or 1xN (or Nx1) where all elements are the same. However, these cases are implicitly handled by the logic.
   - The function does not check if there are any other patterns that might prevent the grid from being made uniform, but the problem constraints and the nature of the operations suggest that if the first and last rows or columns are not uniform but differ, the grid cannot be made uniform.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle the problem as described. The logic is sound and the edge cases are covered.

Correctness: **True**
