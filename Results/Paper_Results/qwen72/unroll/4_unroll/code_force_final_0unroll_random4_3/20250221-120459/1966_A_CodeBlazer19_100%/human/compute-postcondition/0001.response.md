The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer provided by the input, and the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
