The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.**
