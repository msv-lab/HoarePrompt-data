Output State: The loop prints two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with the number 1 or 2, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from `n` to 1 in descending order. The variable `i` will have the value `n + 1` after the loop finishes executing. The state of `n` remains unchanged.
