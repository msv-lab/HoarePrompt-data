#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving an n x n matrix and operations to maximize the sum of its elements, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the matrix size `n` and potentially other inputs as described in the problem.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates `n` times, printing two lines for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with the numbers 1 and 2, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from user input and prints a tuple containing the values `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. It then iterates from 1 to `n`, printing two lines for each iteration. Each line starts with the numbers 1 and 2, followed by the current iteration value `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged after the function execution.
