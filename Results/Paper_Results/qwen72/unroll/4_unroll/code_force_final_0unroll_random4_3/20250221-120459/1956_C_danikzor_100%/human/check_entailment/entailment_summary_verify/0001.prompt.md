You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from user input and prints a tuple containing the values `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. It then iterates from 1 to `n`, printing two lines for each iteration. Each line starts with the numbers 1 and 2, followed by the current iteration value `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene can perform two types of operations on an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - Type 1 operation: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - Type 2 operation: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix, and the solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column can be filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), the sum of each row and each column will be \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - There are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, so the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Verification of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the fact that each element in the matrix will be the sum of the row and column permutations.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 20 \).
   - These values match the expected maximum sums for the given problem.

5. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
