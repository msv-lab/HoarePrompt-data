Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are of two types: assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The program's approach is to use the maximum permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) for both row and column operations, which ensures that the largest possible values are placed in the matrix.

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum sum as \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \). This formula is correct for the sum of the numbers in the matrix when each row and column is filled with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\). This can be derived from the fact that each number from 1 to \( n \) will appear \( 2n - 1 \) times in the matrix, and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum is:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot (2n - 1) = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2} \cdot (2n - 1) = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6}
   \]

2. **Operation Count**: The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit. Each row and each column is assigned the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) exactly once.

3. **Operation Execution**: The operations are correctly formatted and will indeed fill the matrix with the maximum possible values. Each row and each column will be filled with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\), ensuring that the sum of the matrix is maximized.

4. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases. The function reads the input `n` for each test case, which is correct. However, the function `func_1` itself should not be called in a loop that decrements `t` (as in `for t in range(t, 0, -1)`). Instead, it should be called in a loop that processes each test case, such as `for _ in range(t)`.

Given these points, the program is logically correct and will produce the desired output for each test case. However, the loop in the main part of the program should be corrected to properly handle multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True** (with a minor correction in the loop for handling multiple test cases)

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

This correction ensures that the function `func_1` is called the correct number of times for each test case.
