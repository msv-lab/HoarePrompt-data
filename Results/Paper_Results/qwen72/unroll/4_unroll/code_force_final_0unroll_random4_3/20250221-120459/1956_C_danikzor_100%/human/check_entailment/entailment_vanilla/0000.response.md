### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene can perform two types of operations on an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - Type 1 operation: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - Type 2 operation: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix, and the solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column can be filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), the sum of each row and each column will be \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - There are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, so the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Verification of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the fact that each element in the matrix will be the sum of the row and column permutations.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 20 \).
   - These values match the expected maximum sums for the given problem.

5. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
