Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n, and `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.** 

The variable `g` is now a list containing `n + 1` empty lists, where each list corresponds to a vertex in the tree and will be used to store its adjacent vertices. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `edges`) remain unchanged.
