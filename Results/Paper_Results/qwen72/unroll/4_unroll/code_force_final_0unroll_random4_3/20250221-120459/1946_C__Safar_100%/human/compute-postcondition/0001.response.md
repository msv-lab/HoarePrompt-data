The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a`, `b`, and the list `edges`. For the loop to execute, the list `edges` must have at least one tuple. The variables `a` and `b` will take the values of the first tuple in `edges` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `a` and `b` are the first elements of the first tuple in `edges`**
