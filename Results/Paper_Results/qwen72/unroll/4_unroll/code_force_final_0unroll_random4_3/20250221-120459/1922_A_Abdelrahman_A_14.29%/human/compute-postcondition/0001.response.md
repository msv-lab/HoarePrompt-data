The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `tests`. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other parameters (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0**
