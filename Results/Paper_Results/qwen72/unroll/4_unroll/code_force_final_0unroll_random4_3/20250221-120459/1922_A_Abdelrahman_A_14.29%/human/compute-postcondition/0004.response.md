Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` corresponding to the last test case, and the variable `no` will be `False` if any test case printed 'YES', otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `tests` remains unchanged. **
