You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where each test case provides an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times. In each iteration, `n` is read from the input, and the variable `sum` is calculated as the sum of the series `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`. The value of `sum` and `2 * n` are printed. Then, for each `j` from 1 to `n`, two lines are printed: the first line starts with `1` and `n - j + 1` followed by the range from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with `2` and `n - j + 1` followed by the range from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but the output will include the printed values for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. When called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each providing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), it returns a matrix of size `n x n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
