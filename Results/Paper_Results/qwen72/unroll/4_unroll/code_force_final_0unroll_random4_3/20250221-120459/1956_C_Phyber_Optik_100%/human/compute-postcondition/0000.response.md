The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `t`. The `input()` function accepts an input, and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that the function is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where each test case provides an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). However, this code snippet only affects the variable `t` and does not change the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500, representing the size of the matrix.**
