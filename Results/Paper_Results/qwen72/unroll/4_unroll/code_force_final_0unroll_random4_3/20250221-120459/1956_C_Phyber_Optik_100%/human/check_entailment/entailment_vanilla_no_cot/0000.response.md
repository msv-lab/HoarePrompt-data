Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is flawed. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n^3 \). This is because each row and each column can be filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, so the sum of all elements in the matrix is \( n \times (1 + 2 + \ldots + n) = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \). However, since each element is used \( n \) times (once in each row and once in each column), the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = n^3 \).

The program also prints the operations incorrectly. It should print the operations in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values. The correct approach is to fill each row and each column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), which can be done in exactly \( 2n \) operations.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Correct Output:
For the given example input:
```
2
1
2
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 2
1 1 1
2 1 1
7 4
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
```

This output correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides the operations to achieve it.
