The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` after the input is taken and converted to an integer. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The input function will read a value from the user, and this value will determine the number of iterations.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` must be greater than 0 after the input is taken and converted to an integer**
