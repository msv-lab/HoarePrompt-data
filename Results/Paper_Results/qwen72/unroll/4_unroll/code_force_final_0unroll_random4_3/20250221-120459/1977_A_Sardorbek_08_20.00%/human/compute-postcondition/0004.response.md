Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' to the console. The function does not return any value. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop are the values from the last iteration. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` (if they exist outside the function). **
