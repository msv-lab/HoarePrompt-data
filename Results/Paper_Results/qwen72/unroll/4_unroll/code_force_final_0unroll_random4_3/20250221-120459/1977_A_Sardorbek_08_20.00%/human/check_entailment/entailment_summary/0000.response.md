Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. If so, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if `b` equals `c`, Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower `c` times.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If so, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should actually be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`. The current condition checks if the number of test cases `a` has the same parity as the number of moves `b`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should check if the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity. This is because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for Nikita to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - The final condition `else:` prints 'No'. This is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it's impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' for each test case, which matches the problem description. However, the output should be consistent in case (either all uppercase or all lowercase).

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is less than `c` or when `b` equals `c`.

5. **Parity Check**: The parity check is crucial. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. If they have different parities, it is impossible.

Given the above reasoning, the program has a logical error in the parity check condition. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` instead of `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`.

Correctness: **False**
