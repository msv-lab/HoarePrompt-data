The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the integers `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100, and it is designed to operate within a range of 1 to 100 test cases. The specific return value or output for each test case is not provided.**
