Reasoning: 

The original assessment points out two issues with the program:

1. **Handling Equal Digits**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `a == b == c`. However, this is not a problem because the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` will both evaluate to `False` when `a == b == c`. The `else` block will then correctly print "NONE", which is the expected output for this case. Therefore, the program is correct in handling equal digits.

2. **Handling Multiple Conditions**: The original assessment also mentions that the program will print "NONE" for the input `3 4 1` because it does not break out of the loop after finding the first condition that is true. This is a misunderstanding of the program's logic. The `else` block in the program is only executed if neither of the two conditions (`a < b < c` or `a < b > c`) is true. For the input `3 4 1`, the condition `a < b > c` is true, so the program will print "PEAK" and not "NONE". Therefore, the program correctly handles this case.

Given these points, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
