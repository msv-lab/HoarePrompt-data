You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, where `1 <= q <= 1000`. It then processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are left with the values of the last test case. The variable `mn` remains unchanged at 100, and `q` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `q`, from the input. This is correct as per the problem description, which states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is correct for processing each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Data**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct as it matches the problem description, which states that each test case contains three digits (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).

4. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true. This is correct as it matches the definition of a stair in the problem description.

5. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is true. This is correct as it matches the definition of a peak in the problem description.

6. **None Condition**: The program prints "NONE" if neither the stair nor the peak condition is met. However, there is a logical issue here. The `else` block will execute even if the peak condition is true, because the `if` statements are not mutually exclusive. This means that if `a < b > c` is true, "PEAK" will be printed, but the `else` block will also execute, printing "NONE" immediately after "PEAK".

7. **Redundant Variable `mn`**: The variable `mn` is declared but not used in the program. This does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary and can be removed for clarity.

Given the logical issue in the `else` block, the program will produce incorrect output for some test cases. Specifically, it will print "PEAK" and "NONE" for the same test case if the peak condition is met.
