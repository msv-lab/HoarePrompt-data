Output State: **The program returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.** 

This means the program calculates the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` starting from the index `j` in the string `b`, and returns the result of adding `j` to this position. Since `index` is not -1, the character `a[i]` is guaranteed to be found in the substring `b[j:]`.
