Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through the characters of the binary string `a` and checks if they can be found in the binary string `b` in the correct order, which is the definition of a subsequence. The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b` starting from the index `j`. If the character is found, the indices `i` and `j` are updated accordingly, and the count `c` is incremented. If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current value of `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length `k` of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The program handles all the cases correctly, including when the strings are of different lengths and when the subsequence is not found. It also efficiently processes the input constraints, ensuring that it can handle the maximum number of test cases and string lengths as specified.
