You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1

    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'), and i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes three variables: \( i \) (index for string \( a \)), \( j \) (index for string \( b \)), and \( c \) (count of matching characters).
3. **Finding Subsequence**: The `while` loop iterates through both strings, using the `func_1` function to find the next occurrence of \( a[i] \) in \( b \) starting from index \( j \).
4. **Updating Indices and Count**: If `func_1` returns a valid index, it updates \( j \) and \( i \) and increments \( c \). If `func_1` returns -1, it breaks the loop.
5. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the count \( c \).

The `func_1` function correctly finds the next occurrence of \( a[i] \) in \( b \) starting from index \( j \). If the character is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description:
- When \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \) (e.g., \( a = "100" \), \( b = "11010" \)).
- When \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \) (e.g., \( a = "10011" \), \( b = "1110" \)).
- When \( b \) does not contain any character from \( a \) (e.g., \( a = "100" \), \( b = "0" \)).
- When \( a \) or \( b \) are of different lengths (e.g., \( a = "100" \), \( b = "11111" \)).

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs.
