The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
