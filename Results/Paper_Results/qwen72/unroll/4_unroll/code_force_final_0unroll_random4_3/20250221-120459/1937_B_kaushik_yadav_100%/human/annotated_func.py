#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        ans = ''
        
        i = 0
        
        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, `ans` will contain the constructed string, and `counter` will hold the count of consecutive matching characters or the count reset to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `counter` will be the result of the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, and then prints `ans`. It also calculates a `counter` that tracks the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` or resets to 1 if the conditions are not met, and prints `counter`. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
