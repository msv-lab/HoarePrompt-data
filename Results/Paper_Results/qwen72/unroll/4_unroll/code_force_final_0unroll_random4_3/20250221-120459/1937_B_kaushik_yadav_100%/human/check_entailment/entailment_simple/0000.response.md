### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Constructing the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The function initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to determine whether the grasshopper should follow the top row (`a`) or the bottom row (`b`).
   - The loop iterates through each column of the grid:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the character from the top row `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in the bottom row `b` is smaller than the next character in the top row `a`, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If the loop reaches the last column, it appends the character from the bottom row `b` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it moves to the next column by incrementing `i`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The function initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the characters of the strings `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If the characters do not match in any other way, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The grasshopper always tries to stay in the top row until it finds a better option in the bottom row, which ensures that the string is as small as possible.

- **Number of Paths:**
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. The counter is incremented for each matching character, and it is reset when a better option is found in the top row.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the entire string is the same in both rows correctly.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 Â· 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
