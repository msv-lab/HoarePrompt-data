Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string in certain scenarios. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
010
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0001
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0101
1
```

In this case, the lexicographically smallest string should be "0001" and there are 2 paths that yield this string:
1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)
2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)

However, the program outputs "0101" and 1, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the paths. The program does not correctly handle the transition between rows to ensure the smallest string is formed.
