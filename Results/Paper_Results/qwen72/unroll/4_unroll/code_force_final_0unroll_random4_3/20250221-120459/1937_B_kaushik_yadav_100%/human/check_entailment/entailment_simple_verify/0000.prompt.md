You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, `ans` will contain the constructed string, and `counter` will hold the count of consecutive matching characters or the count reset to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `counter` will be the result of the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string in certain scenarios. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
010
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0001
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0101
1
```

In this case, the lexicographically smallest string should be "0001" and there are 2 paths that yield this string:
1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)
2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)

However, the program outputs "0101" and 1, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the paths. The program does not correctly handle the transition between rows to ensure the smallest string is formed.
