Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is the number of test cases read from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
