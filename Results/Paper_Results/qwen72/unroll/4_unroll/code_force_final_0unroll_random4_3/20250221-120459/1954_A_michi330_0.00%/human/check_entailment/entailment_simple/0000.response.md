Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed**:
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors as evenly as possible. If the remaining parts (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) are less than `k`, Bob can repaint those remaining parts to match the color of the most frequent part.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is because Bob will not have enough repaints to cover the parts that Alice has painted with different colors.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. If either condition is true, it prints `NO`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `Yes`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or `m` is 1.
   - It also correctly handles the cases where `n` and `k` are such that Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

6. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that if Alice paints the ribbon with the most even distribution of colors, Bob still cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
