### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - Bob can only succeed if he can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent him from making all parts the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice uses the maximum number of different colors (i.e., `m` colors), Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be the same color if Alice uses `m` colors optimally.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.
   - If `n > k`, there are more parts than Bob can repaint.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can use enough different colors such that Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If true, Bob can repaint all parts, so print 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: If true, Bob can still make all parts the same color, so print 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is true, print 'Yes'.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `1 1 1`
     - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO' (correct).
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `5 1 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true (since `5 - 5 < 1`), so the output is 'NO' (correct).
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `5 2 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false (since `5 - 3 < 1` is false), so the output is 'Yes' (correct).
   - **Example 4:**
     - Input: `5 2 2`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true (since `5 - 3 < 2`), so the output is 'NO' (correct).
   - **Example 5:**
     - Input: `5 5 3`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false (since `5 - 1 < 3` is false), so the output is 'Yes' (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. It handles all the given examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
