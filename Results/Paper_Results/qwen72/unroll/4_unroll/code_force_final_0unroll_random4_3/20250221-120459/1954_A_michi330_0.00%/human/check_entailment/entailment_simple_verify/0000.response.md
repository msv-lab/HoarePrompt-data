Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic of the program and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Here are the key points:
- If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
- If `n > k`, Alice needs to ensure that after Bob repaints `k` parts, there are still parts with different colors. This means that the remaining `n - k` parts must be painted in such a way that they cannot all be the same color.

### Program Logic
The program uses the following condition:
```python
if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('Yes')
```

### Condition Analysis
1. **First Condition: `n <= k`**
   - This condition is correct. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

2. **Second Condition: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition is intended to check if after Bob repaints `k` parts, there are still parts with different colors.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with different colors to ensure that no single color can cover all parts. This is because `n / m` gives the average number of parts per color, and `math.ceil` ensures we round up to the next whole number.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Test Case Analysis
Let's evaluate the test cases mentioned in the original assessment:
- **Test Case: `5 2 2`**
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `math.ceil(5 / 2) = math.ceil(2.5) = 3`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`
  - `2 < 2` is true, so the program prints `NO`.
  - According to the problem description, Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Bob can always repaint 2 parts to match the color of the remaining 3 parts, making all parts the same color.
  - The program's output is correct for this test case.

### Correct Condition
The original assessment suggests the condition `n - k > m` to ensure that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, there are still more than `m` parts left that are of different colors. However, this condition is not correct because it does not account for the distribution of colors. The correct condition should be based on the minimum number of parts that must be painted with different colors to ensure that no single color can cover all parts.

### Conclusion
The program's condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is actually correct. It correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The original assessment incorrectly identified this condition as a logical error.

Final: **True**
