### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input:** A list `a` of positive integers such that `2 <= len(a) <= 50` and `1 <= a[i] <= 10^6` for all `i` in the range `0 <= i < len(a)`.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function first sorts the input array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates the array with itself (`a + a`) to create `concatenated_a`.
     - The function iterates over the first `n` elements of `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no match is found after all iterations, it returns 'No'.

   - **Correctness Analysis:**
     - The logic of `func_1` is based on the idea that if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, then there must be a subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`.
     - This approach is correct because:
       - If the array can be split into two parts `x` and `y` such that `a = x + y` and swapping them results in a sorted array, then `y + x` must be a subarray of `a + a`.
       - The function checks all possible splits by iterating over the first `n` elements of `concatenated_a`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with an array `a` as described in the problem statement.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `a` from the list of strings.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(a)` and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

   - **Correctness Analysis:**
     - The function correctly reads and parses the input data.
     - It processes each test case using `func_1` and collects the results.
     - The results are printed in the correct format as required by the problem statement.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly identifies whether the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - The program's behavior matches the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the array can be checked for the possibility of becoming sorted by splitting and swapping, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases as required.
