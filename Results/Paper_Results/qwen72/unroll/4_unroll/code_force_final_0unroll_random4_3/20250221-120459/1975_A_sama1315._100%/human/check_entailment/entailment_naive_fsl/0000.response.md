Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program provided consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. It does this by creating a concatenated version of the array with itself (`a + a`) and then checking if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array. This approach is correct because if such a subarray exists, it means the original array can be split and swapped to achieve a sorted array.

`func_2` handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads all input data at once, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. This function correctly parses the input and processes each test case as described in the problem statement.

I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected, so the program is considered correct.
