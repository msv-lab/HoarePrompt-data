Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.** 

The initial values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The `input` function reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, and `split()` splits this input into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`.
