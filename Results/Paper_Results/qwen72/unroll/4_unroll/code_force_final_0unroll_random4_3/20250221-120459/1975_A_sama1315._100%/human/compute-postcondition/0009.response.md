Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `n` is the last value of `n` used in the loop.
   - `a` is the last list of integers used in the loop.
   - `data` remains the same list of strings.
   - `idx` is the index after the last element used in the loop.
   - `results` is a list of `t` results from `func_1(a)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains `t` elements, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - Each element in the `results` list is the result of calling `func_1(a)` on the list `a`.
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `data`, `n`, `a`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.
   - The output will be a string where each result from `func_1(a)` is printed on a new line.

Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_t]** (where each `result_i` is the result of calling `func_1(a)` and `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`)
