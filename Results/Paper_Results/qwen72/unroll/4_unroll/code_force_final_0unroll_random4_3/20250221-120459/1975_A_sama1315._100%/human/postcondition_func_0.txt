The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers where the length of `a` is between 2 and 50, and each element is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if the sorted version of `a` is a contiguous subsequence of the list `a` concatenated with itself. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The input list `a` remains unchanged after the function call.
