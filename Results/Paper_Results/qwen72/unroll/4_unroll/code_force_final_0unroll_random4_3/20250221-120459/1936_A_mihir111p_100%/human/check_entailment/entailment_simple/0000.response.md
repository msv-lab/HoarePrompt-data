### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make queries to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to achieve this within 3n queries.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\), which is the length of the permutation \(p\).

3. **Finding the First Maximum:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, `ans1` is updated to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that `ans1` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) is greater, `mx` is updated to \(i\) and `v` is reset to contain only \(i\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) is equal, \(i\) is added to `v`.
   - This step ensures that `v` contains all indices that, when ORed with `ans1`, give the same maximum value.

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The program initializes `mx` and `ans` to the first element in `v`.
   - It iterates through the list `v` and compares \(p_{\text{ans}} \oplus p_{\text{ans1}}\) with \(p_{v[i]} \oplus p_{\text{ans1}}\).
   - If \(p_{v[i]} \oplus p_{\text{ans1}}\) is greater, `ans` is updated to \(v[i]\).
   - This step ensures that `ans` is the index that, when XORed with `ans1`, gives the maximum value.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation and then finds the index that, when XORed with this maximum value, gives the maximum result.
- The number of queries used is within the limit of 3n.
- The program correctly handles the interaction and flushes the output after each query.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
