### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\).
     - For each \(i\), it compares \((p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) using `func_1`.
     - If \((p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `ans1` to \(i\).
   - After finding `ans1`, it initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
     - It then iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\) again.
     - For each \(i\), it compares \((p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}})\) using `func_1`.
     - If \((p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) < (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}})\), it updates `mx` to \(i\) and resets `v` to contain only \(i\).
     - If \((p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) = (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}})\), it appends \(i\) to `v`.
   - Finally, it iterates over the list `v` to find the maximum \(p_i \oplus p_{\text{ans1}}\) and prints the result.

3. **Query Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` prints a query in the required format and returns the user's input.
   - This function is correctly implemented to interact with the problem's constraints.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The first loop finds an index `ans1` such that \(p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) is maximized. This is essentially finding the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop finds all indices `i` such that \(p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}\) is equal to the maximum value found in the first loop.
   - The third loop finds the maximum \(p_i \oplus p_{\text{ans1}}\) among the indices in `v`.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The third loop makes at most \(n-1\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(3(n-1)\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 2\) correctly.
   - The program correctly finds the maximum XOR value and prints the indices.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and follows the problem constraints. It correctly finds the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.

Correctness: **True**
