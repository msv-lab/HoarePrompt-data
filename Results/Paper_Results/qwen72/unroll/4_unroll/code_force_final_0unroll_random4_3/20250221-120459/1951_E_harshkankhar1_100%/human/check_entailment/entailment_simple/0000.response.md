### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input and initializes `n` to the length of `s` and `x` to -1.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `1` and the string `s` itself, and then returns.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]` and sets `x` to the index of this character.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., `x` remains -1), it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, it is a palindrome, and the program will correctly print "NO".
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., "lllllllll"), the program will correctly print "NO" because no partition can be made to avoid palindromes.
   - **Mixed Characters**: If `s` contains mixed characters (e.g., "sinktheyacht"), the program will correctly print "YES" and the string itself as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - **Special Cases**: If `s` is a palindrome but contains a different character at a specific position, the program will attempt to partition the string. The logic for partitioning is correct, as it ensures that the substrings are not palindromes by carefully choosing the split points.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) by using a single pass to find the first different character and then checking the remaining substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the specified cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
