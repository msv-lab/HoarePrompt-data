Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to `func_2()`. Inside the function, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6). `x` is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
        #Output:
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns without any value.
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: [s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the substring from the position immediately after `x` to the end of `s`)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the precondition.
            #   - The integer `2` is printed directly.
            #
            #Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:
            #
            #Output:
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)
        #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` if the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true, otherwise `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `s` from the user input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and has a length `n` (1 <= n <= 10^6). The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions by calling another function `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` returns `False`, the function prints 'YES', followed by the integer `1` and the string `s`, and then returns `None`. If `func_1(s)` returns `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' and returns without any value. If a different character is found at index `x`, the function further checks `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, it prints 'NO' if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, otherwise it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. In all cases, the function either returns `None` or returns without any value.
