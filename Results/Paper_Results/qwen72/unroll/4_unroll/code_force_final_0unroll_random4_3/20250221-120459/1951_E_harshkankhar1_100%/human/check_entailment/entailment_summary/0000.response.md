Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and behaves as expected based on the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and determines if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `1` and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
     - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
         - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
         - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the case where the entire string `s` is not a palindrome.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all characters in `s` are the same, which is a valid scenario for printing 'NO'.
   - The function correctly identifies the first different character and checks the subsequent substring to ensure it is not a palindrome.
   - The logic for handling the cases where `x` is 1 or `n // 2` is also correct, as it ensures that the partition is valid and non-palindromic.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
