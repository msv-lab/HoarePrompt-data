Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem. It only reads a single string and processes it, which is incorrect.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the string is entirely composed of the same character (e.g., "lllllllll"). In such cases, the program should output "NO" because no partition can be made where each part is not a palindrome. However, the program may incorrectly output "YES" in some cases.

3. **Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic parts is flawed. The program attempts to find the first character that is different from the first character and then checks if the remaining substring is a palindrome. This approach is not robust enough to handle all cases, especially when the string has more complex patterns.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not always print the correct number of parts and the parts themselves in the required format. For example, the spaces in the output are not consistent, and the program may print "NO" incorrectly in some cases.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would be to:
- Check if the string is already non-palindromic. If it is, print "YES" and the string itself as a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, check if it can be partitioned into two or more parts where each part is not a palindrome. This can be done by finding the first character that is different from the next character and creating a partition at that point.
- If no such partition can be found (i.e., the string is composed of the same character repeated), print "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve(s):
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i-1]:
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(s[:i], s[i:])
                return
    print('NO')

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        solve(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **is_palindrome(s)**: This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
- **solve(s)**: This function processes a single test case. It first checks if the string is already non-palindromic. If it is, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single part. If the string is a palindrome, it tries to find a partition where both parts are non-palindromic. If such a partition is found, it prints "YES" and the partition. If no such partition is found, it prints "NO".
- **main()**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the `solve` function.

This corrected program should handle all the cases specified in the problem description correctly.
