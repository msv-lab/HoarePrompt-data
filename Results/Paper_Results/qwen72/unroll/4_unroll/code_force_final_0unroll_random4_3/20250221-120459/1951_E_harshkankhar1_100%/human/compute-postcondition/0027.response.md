The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters is used, where the length of `s` (denoted as `n`) is between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive. An integer `x` is initialized to -1. The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function returns without any value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It can either return `None` or return without any value.**
