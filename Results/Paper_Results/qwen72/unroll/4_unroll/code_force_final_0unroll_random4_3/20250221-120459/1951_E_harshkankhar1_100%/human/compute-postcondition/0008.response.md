The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, as `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 1 to produce a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `x` is -1
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns True

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, `i` is 1, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True**
