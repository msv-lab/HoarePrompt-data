The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will certainly execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
