Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
