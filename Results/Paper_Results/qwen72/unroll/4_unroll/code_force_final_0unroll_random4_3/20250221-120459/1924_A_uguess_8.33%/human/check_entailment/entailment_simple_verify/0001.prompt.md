You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, if the count of distinct characters in the string `s` that are part of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is at least `n`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' followed by a string that represents the characters that were not found in `s` and a string of 'a' characters to make up the difference to `n`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not modified by the loop, but the loop prints the results for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. Each test case reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s`.

2. **Bitmask for Tracking Characters**: The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track which of the first `k` characters have been seen in the string `s`. This is done by shifting `1` left by the position of the character in the alphabet and checking if it is already set in `cur`.

3. **Counting Full Sets of Characters**: The program increments `cnt` every time `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, which indicates that all `k` characters have been seen in some subsequence of `s`. This is a correct approach to count the number of times all `k` characters appear in a subsequence.

4. **Checking if All Possible Strings are Subsequences**: The program checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it prints "YES". This is incorrect because `cnt` only counts the number of times all `k` characters appear in a subsequence, not the number of distinct subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` characters.

5. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**: If `cnt` is less than `n`, the program attempts to generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`. It does this by:
   - Creating a string `ans` with `cnt` characters of the last character in the first `k` characters.
   - Finding a character that has not been seen in `cur` and appending it to `ans`.
   - Appending the remaining characters as 'a'.

   This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the generated string is a valid subsequence of length `n` that does not occur in `s`. The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if they are subsequences of `s`.

6. **Output**: The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the incorrect condition and generates a potentially incorrect missing subsequence.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`, and it does not generate a valid missing subsequence.

Correctness: **False**
