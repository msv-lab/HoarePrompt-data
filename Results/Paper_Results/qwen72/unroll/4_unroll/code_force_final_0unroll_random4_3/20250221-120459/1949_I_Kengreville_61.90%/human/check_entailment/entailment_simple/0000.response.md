### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, and other necessary information.
   - The `nodes` list is used to keep track of the disks in the current connected component during the DFS traversal.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connected components of the graph formed by the disks.
   - For each disk `i` that has not been visited, it initializes `coef0[i]` to 0 and `coef1[i]` to 1.
   - It then appends `i` to the `nodes` list and calls the `dfs` function to explore all disks that are tangent to `i`.

3. **Tangency Check:**
   - The `dfs` function checks if the distance between the centers of disks `i` and `j` is exactly equal to the sum of their radii, which means they are tangent.
   - If they are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` and continues the DFS traversal.

4. **Sum of Coefficients:**
   - After the DFS traversal, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the current connected component.
   - It checks if the sum of `coef1` (`c1`) is non-zero. If `c1` is non-zero, it means that there is a way to adjust the radii of the disks in the connected component such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency.

5. **Output:**
   - If any connected component has a non-zero `c1`, the program prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition:** The program correctly identifies tangency by checking if the Euclidean distance between the centers of two disks is equal to the sum of their radii.
- **DFS Traversal:** The DFS traversal ensures that all disks in a connected component are visited and their coefficients are updated accordingly.
- **Coefficient Update:** The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted. The update rules ensure that the tangency condition is maintained.
- **Sum Check:** The program correctly checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero, which is a necessary condition for the radii adjustment to be possible.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks and checks if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
