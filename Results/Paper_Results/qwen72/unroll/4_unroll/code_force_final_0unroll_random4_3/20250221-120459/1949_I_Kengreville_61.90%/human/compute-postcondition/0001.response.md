Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, where `visited[i]` is now `True`, `nodes` is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks being processed, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of numbers representing coefficients used in the DFS algorithm.**
