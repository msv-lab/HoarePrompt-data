You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where len(x) = len(y) = len(r) = n, and for each i, -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False and None respectively. nodes is an empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []

    #State: `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if any of the `c1` values calculated in the loop are non-zero, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `True` if at least one of the `c1` values calculated in the loop is non-zero; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and an empty list `nodes`. It returns a value based on the input lists, but the specific return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
