Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `True` because at least one of the `c1` values calculated in the loop is non-zero.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The value of `ok` being `True` is a precondition that indicates the condition for printing `'YES'` is met, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Output: **YES**
