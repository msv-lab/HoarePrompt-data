The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute if `n` is within this range. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0**
