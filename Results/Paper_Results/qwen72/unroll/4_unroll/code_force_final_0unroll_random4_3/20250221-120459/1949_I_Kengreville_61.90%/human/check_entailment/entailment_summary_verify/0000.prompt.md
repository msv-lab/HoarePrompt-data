You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []

        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited if it has not been visited before and appends `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly `r[i] + r[j]` units away from the center of disk `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates `visited[j]` to `True`, `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`, and appends `j` to the `nodes` list. If the disk at index `i` has already been visited, the function returns without making any changes. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap is flawed.

### Issue:
1. **DFS Logic and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the way coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) are assigned and used to determine if the sum of radii can be decreased is not clear and does not seem to follow a well-defined mathematical or logical approach.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to balance the changes in radii, but the logic for setting these coefficients and the final check `c1 != 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the disks are already in a configuration that cannot be changed to meet the requirements. For example, if all disks are already tangent to each other and their radii are such that any change would cause overlap or break tangency, the program should return `NO`. However, the current logic might incorrectly return `YES`.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
- The disks are arranged in a line, each tangent to the next.
- If we try to decrease the radii of the first and third disks by 0.5 and increase the radius of the second disk by 1.0, the sum of radii would remain the same (1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3).
- The program should return `NO` because it is not possible to strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the current logic might incorrectly return `YES`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
