Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `False` because none of the `c1` values calculated in the loop are non-zero.**
