The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder that is typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body. Before the loop starts, the value of `_` is not relevant, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
