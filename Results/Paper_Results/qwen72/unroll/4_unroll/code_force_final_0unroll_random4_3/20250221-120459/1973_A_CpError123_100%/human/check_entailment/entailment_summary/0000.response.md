### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The first condition checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total number of points in all games (whether won or drawn) must be even. Each game contributes either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (two draws), so an odd sum is impossible.

2. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the total number of points that the two players with the lowest scores could have collectively earned.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `min(x, y)`. This is the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. The reasoning is as follows:
     - If `y` (the sum of the two lowest scores) is less than or equal to `x` (the total number of games), then the maximum number of draws is `y`, because all the points in `y` could have come from draws.
     - If `y` is greater than `x`, then the maximum number of draws is `x`, because the total number of games limits the number of draws.

### Analysis of Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1: (0, 0, 0)**
  - Sum: 0 (even)
  - `x = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - `y = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Output: `min(0, 0) = 0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: (0, 1, 1)**
  - Sum: 2 (even)
  - `x = 2 // 2 = 1`
  - `y = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `min(1, 1) = 1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: (1, 1, 1)**
  - Sum: 3 (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 2)**
  - Sum: 4 (even)
  - `x = 4 // 2 = 2`
  - `y = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(2, 2) = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: (3, 3, 3)**
  - Sum: 9 (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6: (3, 4, 5)**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - `x = 12 // 2 = 6`
  - `y = 3 + 4 = 7`
  - Output: `min(6, 7) = 6` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7: (1, 1, 10)**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - `x = 12 // 2 = 6`
  - `y = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(6, 2) = 2` (Correct)
