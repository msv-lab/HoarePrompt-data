Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the scores are such that they cannot be achieved by any valid set of games and results. For example, consider the input `1 1 10`. The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve scores of 1, 1, and 10 with the given scoring rules.

Let's break down the issue:
- The total points (1 + 1 + 10 = 12) are even, so the program does not immediately return `-1`.
- The program calculates `x = (1 + 1 + 10) // 2 = 6` and `y = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- It then prints `min(6, 2) = 2`.

However, achieving scores of 1, 1, and 10 is impossible because:
- If there are no draws, the points must be multiples of 2 (since each game results in 2 points being distributed).
- If there are draws, the points must be such that the total points minus the number of draws is a multiple of 2.

In this case, the only way to achieve a score of 10 for one player while the others have 1 point each is if the player with 10 points won all their games, but this would mean the other two players should have more than 1 point. Therefore, the program's output of `2` is incorrect, and the correct output should be `-1`.
