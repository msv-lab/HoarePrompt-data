The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l + 1 < r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute at least once, `r` must be greater than 1 (since `l + 1` would be 1, and `r` must be greater than this value).

Given that `r` is the length of `arr`, the list `arr` must have at least 2 elements for `r` to be greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `l`, but `r` must be greater than 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1**
