The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (the number of test cases) and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` (all integers within specified ranges). The function is expected to process these parameters and produce a specific output based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.**
