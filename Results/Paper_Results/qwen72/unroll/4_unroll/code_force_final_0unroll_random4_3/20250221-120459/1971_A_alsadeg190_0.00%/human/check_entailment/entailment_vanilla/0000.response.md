Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The function then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is correct for processing each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the function reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case. This is also correct.
4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The function checks if `x` is greater than `y` using the condition `if x > y:`.
   - If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is not greater than `y` (i.e., `x <= y`), it prints `y` followed by `x`.

However, there is a mistake in the output logic. The problem statement requires the output to be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The current logic prints the maximum followed by the minimum, which is the opposite of what is required.

To fix this, the print statements should be swapped:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly output the minimum followed by the maximum for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
