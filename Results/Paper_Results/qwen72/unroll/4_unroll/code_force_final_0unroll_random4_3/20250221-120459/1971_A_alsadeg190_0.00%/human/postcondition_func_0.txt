The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, it reads an integer `x` from the input, and then for each integer from 0 to `x-1`, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the input. It then prints the pair in ascending order. After all iterations, the last values of `x` and `y` read from the input will be retained, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`. The function does not return any value.
