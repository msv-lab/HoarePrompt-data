The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. `a` and `b` are binary strings, and `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of a specific operation on the binary strings `a` and `b` for each test case. However, the exact nature of the operation and the return value are not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a` and `b` (binary strings), `n` and `m` (integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively), and handles multiple test cases indicated by an integer `t`. For each test case, it performs an operation on the binary strings `a` and `b` and returns a result.**
