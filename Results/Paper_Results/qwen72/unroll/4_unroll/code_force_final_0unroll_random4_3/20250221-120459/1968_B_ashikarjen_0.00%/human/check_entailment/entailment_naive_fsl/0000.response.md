Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple test cases. According to the problem description, the first line of input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The program should be able to process `t` test cases, but the provided function `func_1` only processes a single test case. To correctly handle multiple test cases, the function should be called in a loop that runs `t` times. Here is an example of a failing case:

Input:
```
2
3 3
100
110
5 4
10011
1110
```

Expected Output:
```
2
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

The program only processes the first test case and does not continue to the second one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
