Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (5, 4, '10011', '1110'),
    (3, 3, '100', '110'),
    (1, 3, '1', '111'),
    (4, 4, '1011', '1111'),
    (3, 5, '100', '11010'),
    (3, 1, '100', '0')
]
```

This way, the function can process multiple test cases as described.
