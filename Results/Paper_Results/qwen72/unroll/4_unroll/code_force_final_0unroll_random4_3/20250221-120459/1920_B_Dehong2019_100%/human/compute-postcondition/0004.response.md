The function `func` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, and two integers `k` and `x`. The list `a` should contain at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5 elements, each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The integers `k` and `x` should be non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ len(a). The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of the lengths of the arrays across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns the modified list `a` after Alice has removed `k` elements and Bob has multiplied `x` elements by -1. The specific elements chosen for removal and multiplication are not specified, but the function ensures that the operations are performed within the given constraints.
