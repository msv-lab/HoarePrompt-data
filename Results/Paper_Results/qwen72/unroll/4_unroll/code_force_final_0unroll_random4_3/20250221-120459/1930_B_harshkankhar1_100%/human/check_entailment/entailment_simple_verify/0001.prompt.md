You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [n, 2, n-1, 4, n-2, 6, ..., n%2+1, n-1, n%2] (where the elements at even indices are in descending order from n to 1, and the elements at odd indices are in ascending order from 2 to n-1)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the modified list `a` using `print(*a)`.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The program generates a permutation of length `n` by reversing the elements at even indices.
   - This approach ensures that the elements at even indices are in a different order from the original, which helps in breaking the pattern where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct `i` and `j`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are not in the same order as the original, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. This permutation does not have any `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - For `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`, which is a valid permutation.
   - For larger values of `n`, the same logic applies, ensuring that the permutation is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Correctness: **True**
