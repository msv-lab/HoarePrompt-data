You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Annotated Code:

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is done to determine the minimum cost Kirill would have to pay to move past each person in the queue.
   - The list `suff` is then computed to store the suffix sums of the list `c`. Specifically, `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum cost.
   - It then iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of these positions. For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` if this cost is lower than the current `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Suffix Sum Calculation:**
  - The suffix sum `suff` is correctly calculated in reverse order, which allows the program to efficiently compute the total cost of moving past multiple people in the queue.
  - This ensures that the cost to move from position `i` to any position `j < i` is correctly accounted for.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost to move to position `i` is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which is the cost to bribe the person at position `i` plus the cost to bribe all people between positions `i + 1` and `n`.
  - This approach ensures that the minimum cost is found by considering all possible positions Kirill can move to within the first `k` positions.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `n` (i.e., Kirill can be in any position) correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 1, meaning Kirill can only move to the first position, by correctly calculating the cost to move to the first position.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by efficiently calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions in the queue. The logic and implementation are sound and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
