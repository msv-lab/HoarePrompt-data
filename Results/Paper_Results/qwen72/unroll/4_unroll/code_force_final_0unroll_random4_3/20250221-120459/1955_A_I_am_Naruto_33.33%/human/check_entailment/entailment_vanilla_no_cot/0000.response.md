Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than 1. This is necessary because the promotion price for two yogurts only applies if `n` is at least 2.
4. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion price as much as possible, and the remaining yogurts (if any) are bought at the regular price. This is done by:
     - `b * (n // 2)` which is the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts.
     - `a * (n % 2)` which is the cost for the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.
5. **Output the Minimum Cost**: The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, ensuring that the least amount of burles is spent.

The logic is sound and handles all edge cases, including when `n` is 1. Therefore, the program is correct.
