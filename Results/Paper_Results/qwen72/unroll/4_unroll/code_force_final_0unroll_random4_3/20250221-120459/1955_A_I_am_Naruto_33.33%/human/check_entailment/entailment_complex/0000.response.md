Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. If `n > 1`, it calculates two potential costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
2. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
3. If `n == 1`, it simply prints the regular price `a` since only one yogurt is needed.

Let's analyze the correctness of the logic:
- For `n > 1`, the calculation `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` correctly accounts for the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
- For `n == 1`, the program correctly prints the regular price `a`.

The program handles all specified input ranges and test cases correctly. The example provided in the problem description is also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
