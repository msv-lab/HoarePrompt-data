Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n > 1`, it calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buys the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n == 1`, it prints the regular price `a` because there is only one yogurt to buy, and the promotion does not apply.

**Analysis**:
- The formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` correctly calculates the cost when using the promotion as much as possible. It buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price `b` and buys the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
- The program handles the case where `n == 1` separately, which is correct because the promotion does not apply when buying a single yogurt.
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each test case.

**Example Verification**:
- For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - The minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - The minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - The minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
- For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - The minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for each test case and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
