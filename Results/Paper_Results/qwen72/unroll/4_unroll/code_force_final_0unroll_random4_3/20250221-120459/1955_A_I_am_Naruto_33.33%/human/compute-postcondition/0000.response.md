The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is not directly involved in the loop head, but it implies that `int(input())` should be within the range 1 to 10^4 to align with the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^4**
