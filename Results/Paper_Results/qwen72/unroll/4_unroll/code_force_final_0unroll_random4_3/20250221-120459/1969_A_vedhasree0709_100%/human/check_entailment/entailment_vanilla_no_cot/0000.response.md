Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this approach is not sufficient to handle all possible scenarios.

### Issues:
1. **Pair Detection**: The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` for such cases. However, it does not handle other scenarios where more than one pair might exist or where friends form cycles of length greater than 2.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The program does not detect cycles in the friendship graph. For example, if the friends form a cycle of length 3 (e.g., `p = [2, 3, 1]`), the program will incorrectly print `3` instead of `3`.
3. **General Case**: The program does not correctly handle the general case where the minimum number of invitations needed might be more than 2 or 3.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Identify Pairs**: Check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. **Identify Cycles**: Check for cycles in the friendship graph. The length of the cycle will determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
3. **General Case**: If no pairs or cycles are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is `n` (since each friend needs an invitation to ensure at least 2 friends come).

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def min_invitations():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invites = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_length = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = p[current] - 1
                    cycle_length += 1
                
                if cycle_length == 2:
                    min_invites = 2
                    break
                elif cycle_length > 2:
                    min_invites = min(min_invites, cycle_length)
        
        results.append(min_invites)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

min_invitations()
```

This solution correctly handles all the cases by detecting cycles and pairs, and it ensures that the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately.
