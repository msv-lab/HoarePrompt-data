The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is being iterated over a range determined by the integer input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must be at least 1, meaning the integer input must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value for the range. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, the input value should be `t` to ensure the loop runs for each test case.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `int(input())` must be `t`**
