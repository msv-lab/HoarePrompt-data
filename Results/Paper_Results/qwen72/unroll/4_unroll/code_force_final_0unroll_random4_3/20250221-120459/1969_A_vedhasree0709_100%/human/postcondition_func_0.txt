The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers, each not equal to its index. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a pair `(i, p)` such that `l[p - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any values, and the state of the program after each test case is that the variables `t`, `n`, and `l` retain their values, while `i` and `j` are reset for the next test case.
