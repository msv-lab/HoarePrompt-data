### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s and 3s is even, and the number of 2s and 4s is even.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, the XOR of 2 and 2 is 0, and the XOR of 4 and 4 is 0.
   - Therefore, to make the XOR zero, we need to ensure that the number of 1s and 3s is even, and the number of 2s and 4s is even.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - If the total number of 1s and 3s is odd, removing one 1 or 3 will make it even.
   - Similarly, if the total number of 2s and 4s is odd, removing one 2 or 4 will make it even.
   - The optimal strategy is to remove pairs of numbers that make the XOR zero, and if there are odd counts, remove one to make them even.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
     - Dividing each count by 2 to get the number of pairs that can be removed.
     - Adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3, which indicates that there is one 1, one 2, and one 3 left, and removing one of these will make the XOR zero.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s by adding 1 to the result if the sum of the remainders is 3.
   - However, the program does not consider the count of 4s in the remainder check, which is a critical oversight. The XOR of 4 and 4 is 0, so the presence of an odd number of 4s can also affect the XOR result.

### Detailed Analysis of the Remainder Check:
- The program uses `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` to check if there are exactly three odd numbers among 1s, 2s, and 3s. This is correct for the specific case of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- However, the count of 4s (d) is not included in this check. If `d` is odd, it should also be considered because the XOR of 4 and 4 is 0, and an odd number of 4s can make the XOR non-zero.

### Corrected Remainder Check:
- The correct check should be `int((a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 + d % 2) % 2 == 1)`. This ensures that the total number of odd counts (including 4s) is odd, which means removing one of these will make the XOR zero.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not consider the count of 4s in the remainder check.
- The corrected program should include the count of 4s in the remainder check to ensure the XOR is correctly evaluated.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int((a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 + d % 2) % 2 == 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the oversight in the remainder check. The corrected program should include the count of 4s in the remainder check to ensure the XOR is correctly evaluated.

Final: **False**
