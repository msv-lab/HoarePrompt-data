You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each p_i is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read four integers (a, b, c, d) and print the sum of their integer divisions by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of them are odd. The values of t and each p_i remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, the XOR of 2 and 2 is 0, and the XOR of 4 and 4 is 0.
   - Therefore, to make the XOR zero, we need to ensure that the number of 1s and 3s is even, and the number of 2s and 4s is even.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - If the total number of 1s and 3s is odd, removing one 1 or 3 will make it even.
   - Similarly, if the total number of 2s and 4s is odd, removing one 2 or 4 will make it even.
   - The optimal strategy is to remove pairs of numbers that make the XOR zero, and if there are odd counts, remove one to make them even.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
     - Dividing each count by 2 to get the number of pairs that can be removed.
     - Adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3, which indicates that there is one 1, one 2, and one 3 left, and removing one of these will make the XOR zero.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s by adding 1 to the result if the sum of the remainders is 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
