The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or process a set of parameters `t` and `p_i`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each `p_i` is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of parameters `t` and `p_i`, where `t` is an integer in the range 1 to 10,000, and each `p_i` is an integer in the range 0 to 200. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
