### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, the XOR of 2 and 2 is 0, and the XOR of 4 and 4 is 0.
   - Therefore, to make the XOR zero, we need to ensure that the number of 1s and 3s is even, and the number of 2s and 4s is even.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - If the total number of 1s and 3s is odd, removing one 1 or 3 will make it even.
   - Similarly, if the total number of 2s and 4s is odd, removing one 2 or 4 will make it even.
   - The optimal strategy is to remove pairs of numbers that make the XOR zero, and if there are odd counts, remove one to make them even.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
     - Dividing each count by 2 to get the number of pairs that can be removed.
     - Adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3, which indicates that there is one 1, one 2, and one 3 left, and removing one of these will make the XOR zero.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s by adding 1 to the result if the sum of the remainders is 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

Correctness: **True**
