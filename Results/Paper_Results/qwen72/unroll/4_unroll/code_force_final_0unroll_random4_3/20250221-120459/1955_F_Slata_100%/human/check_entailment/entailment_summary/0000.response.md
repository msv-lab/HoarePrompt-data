### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key observation is that the bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair cancels out the XOR effect.

Given the input \( (a, b, c, d) \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively, the program calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero. Specifically:

- \( a // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 1s.
- \( b // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 2s.
- \( c // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 3s.
- \( d // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 4s.

Each pair of the same number will result in a zero XOR, so removing these pairs will not change the XOR of the remaining numbers. However, if there are exactly three odd counts among \( a, b, \) and \( c \), removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, as the remaining numbers will form pairs that cancel out.

The program's logic is:
1. Calculate the number of pairs for each type of number.
2. Add 1 to the total if exactly three of the counts \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are odd.

This logic is correct because:
- Removing pairs of the same number does not affect the XOR.
- Removing one number when exactly three counts are odd will make the XOR zero.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The execution summary aligns with the problem description and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.
