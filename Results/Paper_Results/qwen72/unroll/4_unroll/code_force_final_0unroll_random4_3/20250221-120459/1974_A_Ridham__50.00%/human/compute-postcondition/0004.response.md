To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case.
- Each screen can accommodate up to 15 cells.
- The total number of test cases is `n`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a list where each element represents the number of screens required for a specific test case.
   - Each screen can hold up to 15 cells, so the number of screens required for a test case is calculated based on the number of cells in that test case divided by 15, rounding up to the nearest whole number.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement**:
   - `map(str, result)` converts each element in the `result` list to a string.
   - `'\n'.join(map(str, result))` joins these string elements with a newline character (`\n`), effectively creating a single string where each element of `result` is on a new line.
   - `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` prints this string to the console.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Each element represents the number of screens required for the corresponding test case.

Since the exact values of the test cases and the `result` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each element represents the number of screens required for the corresponding test case)**
