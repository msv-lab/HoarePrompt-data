The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `t` and the values of `x` and `y` do not affect the loop's execution, and `result` being an empty list also does not impact the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
