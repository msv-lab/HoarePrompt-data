Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a tower with exactly `m` cubes can be built after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove a single cube from the tower. Let's break down the logic and the states provided:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves (`n`) and `c` is the target number of cubes (`m`).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (target number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the target number of cubes, Nikita can simply add a cube in each move to achieve the target.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the parity of the number of moves and the target number of cubes must match for it to be possible to achieve the target. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final number of cubes is even.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because if the parities of `b` and `c` do not match, it is impossible to achieve the target number of cubes.

3. **State of the Program**:
   - The function iterates `a` times, reading a new pair of integers `b` and `c` for each test case.
   - The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop, which is expected and correct for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
