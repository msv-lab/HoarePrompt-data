The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an input integer, and `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. However, for the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100**
