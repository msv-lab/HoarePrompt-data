The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of the number of cards of each type (`a`). It calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins, ensuring that the number of cards of each type does not exceed a calculated value `r`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the initial value of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged.
