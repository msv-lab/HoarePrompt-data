The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `ii` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
