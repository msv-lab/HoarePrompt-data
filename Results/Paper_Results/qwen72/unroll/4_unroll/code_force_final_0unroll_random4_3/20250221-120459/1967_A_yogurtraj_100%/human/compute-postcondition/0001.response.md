Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the output is the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins, k, such that the number of cards of each type is at most the calculated value r. The variables t, n, k, a, r, rem, and y have been updated accordingly for each test case, but the initial value of t (the number of test cases) remains unchanged.**
