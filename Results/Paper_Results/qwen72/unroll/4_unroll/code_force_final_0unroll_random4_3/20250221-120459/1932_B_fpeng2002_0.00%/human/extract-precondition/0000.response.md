Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or another method not defined in the function signature. The input should consist of multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).**
