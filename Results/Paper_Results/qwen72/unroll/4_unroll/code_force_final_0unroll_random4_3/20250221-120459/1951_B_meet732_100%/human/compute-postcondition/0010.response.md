Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `c` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is 1. The first element of `ind` is 0, which means the first element in `a` is greater than `x`.**
