Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal swap position for the cow with index `k` to maximize the number of wins. The function `func_1` does not take into account the possibility of swapping the cow to a position that would allow it to win more matches.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 2
10 12 14 11 8 3
```
Here, `n = 6`, `k = 2`, and the ratings are `[10, 12, 14, 11, 8, 3]`.

- **Expected Output:** 2
- **Actual Output:** 0

**Explanation:**
- Initially, the cow with rating 12 (index 1) will win the first match against the cow with rating 10 (index 0).
- The cow with rating 12 will then face the cow with rating 14 (index 2) and lose.
- However, if we swap the cow with rating 12 to position 3 (index 2), the sequence becomes `[10, 14, 12, 11, 8, 3]`.
- The cow with rating 14 will win the first match.
- The cow with rating 14 will then face the cow with rating 12 and lose.
- The cow with rating 12 will then face the cow with rating 11 and win.
- The cow with rating 12 will then face the cow with rating 8 and win.
- The cow with rating 12 will then face the cow with rating 3 and win.

In this scenario, the cow with rating 12 can win 2 matches, but the program incorrectly returns 0. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the optimal swap position to maximize the number of wins for the cow with index `k`.
