You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the number of additional vertices that can be chosen to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, under the constraint that at most `y` additional vertices can be selected. The function prints the total number of ways to choose these additional vertices. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices, along with the calculated and printed value of `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen.
   - It then adjusts the vertices to be zero-indexed and sorts them.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because the minimum number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices is `x - 2` (since a triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle).

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices `a` and checks if the next vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` and the vertex after that `(a[i] + 2) % n` are present in the set of chosen vertices.
   - If `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not present and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is present, it increments the answer `ans` by 1. This step is intended to count additional triangles that can be formed by adding a single vertex between two existing chosen vertices.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices in the sorted list `a`. The gaps are the number of vertices between two chosen vertices.
   - It appends these gaps to a list `gaps` and sorts the list in ascending order.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to add vertices to form more triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If the number of available additional vertices `y` is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, it adds the entire gap to the answer and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds `2 * y` to the answer and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final answer `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `x - 2` is correct because it represents the minimum number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices.

- **Additional Triangles:**
  - The logic for checking if `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not present and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is present is correct. This ensures that adding a single vertex between two existing chosen vertices can form an additional triangle.

- **Gaps Calculation:**
  - The gaps are correctly calculated and sorted. This helps in efficiently using the additional vertices to form the maximum number of triangles.

- **Maximizing Triangles:**
  - The logic for adding vertices to gaps is correct. It ensures that the maximum number of triangles is formed by adding vertices to the smallest gaps first, which is a valid greedy approach.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by following the steps outlined in the problem description. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
