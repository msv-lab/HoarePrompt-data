The only objects in the loop head are `gap` and `gaps`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `gaps`. If `gaps` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The initial state provided does not guarantee that `gaps` has elements, so we need to ensure that `gaps` is a non-empty list.

State: **`n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged, `gaps` is a sorted list containing at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`**
