### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - This sorting is done to maximize the difference between elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and the first `n` elements of `b` (since `m >= n`).
   - For each element, it calculates the difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimal Difference Calculation:**
   - The program checks if there is a point where the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - If such a point is found, it sets `temp` to the index `i` and breaks the loop.
   - This is done to ensure that the program can switch to using the largest possible differences from the end of the sorted `b` array.

5. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If `temp` is set to a valid index, the program iterates from `temp` to `n` and calculates the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` instead of `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - This adjustment ensures that the program uses the largest possible differences to maximize `D`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program's approach is to sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, which is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
- The initial loop calculates the differences using the first `n` elements of `b` in descending order.
- The program checks for a point where switching to the end of the sorted `b` array would yield a larger difference and makes the necessary adjustments.
- This approach ensures that the program always uses the largest possible differences to maximize `D`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
