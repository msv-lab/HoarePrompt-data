You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reversed sorted list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop uses their values to compute the result for each test case. After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution, and the final output state is the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is the length of list `b`, and two lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
