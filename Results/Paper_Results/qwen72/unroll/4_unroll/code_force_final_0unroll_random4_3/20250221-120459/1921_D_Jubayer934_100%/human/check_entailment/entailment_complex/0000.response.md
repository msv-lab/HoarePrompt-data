### Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The function sorts the list `a` in ascending order and the list `b` in descending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Vasya to maximize the difference between the elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It also initializes a variable `temp` to -1, which will be used to determine if a better difference can be achieved by using the reverse order of `b`.
   - The function then iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute differences.
   - If at any point, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the element from the end of the reversed `b`) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks the loop. This indicates that using the reverse order of `b` from this point onwards will yield a larger total difference.
   - If `temp` is not -1, the function continues to append the differences using the reverse order of `b` from the `temp` index onwards.

4. **Output**: The function prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic
- **Sorting and Reversing**: Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
- **Breaking the Loop**: The loop breaks when a better difference is found by using the reverse order of `b`. This is a valid approach because it allows the function to switch to the reverse order if it results in a higher total difference.
- **Summing the Differences**: The function correctly sums the differences and prints the result for each test case.

### Potential Issues
- **Indexing in `b`**: The indexing `b[-(n - i)]` is correct because it accesses the elements from the end of the list `b` in reverse order.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when all elements in `b` are the same as in the second test case, where the output is 0.

### Conclusion
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for maximizing the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). The approach of sorting and reversing the lists, and then calculating the differences, is sound and should produce the correct results for the given problem description.
