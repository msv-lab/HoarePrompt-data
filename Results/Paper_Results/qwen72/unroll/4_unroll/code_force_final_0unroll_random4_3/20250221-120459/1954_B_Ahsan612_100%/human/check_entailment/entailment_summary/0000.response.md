Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The key points to consider are:
1. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same using the specified operation.
2. The program should output -1 if it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, or the minimum number of elements to remove otherwise.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
- It initializes `same` to 1 (to count the length of consecutive segments of the same number), `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
- It iterates through the array, counting the length of consecutive segments of the same number.
- When it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` with the minimum length of the consecutive segments found so far and resets `same` to 1.
- After the loop, it updates `minn` with the last segment length.
- Finally, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or if it equals the length of the array. If either condition is true, it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array not beautiful). Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is uniform (all elements are the same). It should output -1 in this case.
2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform but can still be made beautiful by removing elements. It should find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made beautiful.

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Check if all elements in the array are the same and output -1 if they are.
2. Correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle the uniform array case and may not always find the correct minimum number of elements to remove. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
