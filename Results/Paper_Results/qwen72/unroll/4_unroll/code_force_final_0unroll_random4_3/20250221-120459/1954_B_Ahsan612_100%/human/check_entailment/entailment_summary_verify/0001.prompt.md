You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `a`. If the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or if no such segment exists, it outputs -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are read from input and retain their values for the next test case, while internal variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows operations where an element at index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) can be replaced by `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no such operation can be performed.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The output should be the minimum number of elements to remove, or `-1` if it is impossible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements.
   - If the entire array is made up of the same element, it outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Code Walkthrough**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array:
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the value of `same`.
   - Finally, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make it non-beautiful, but the problem specifies that the array is beautiful, so this case should not occur.
   - **Array with All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - **Array with Mixed Elements**: The program correctly identifies the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements and outputs it.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It handles the edge case where all elements are the same by outputting `-1`.
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements is sound.
