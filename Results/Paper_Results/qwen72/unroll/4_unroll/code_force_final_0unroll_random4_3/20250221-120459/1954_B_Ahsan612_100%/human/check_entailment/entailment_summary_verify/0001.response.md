### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows operations where an element at index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) can be replaced by `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no such operation can be performed.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The output should be the minimum number of elements to remove, or `-1` if it is impossible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements.
   - If the entire array is made up of the same element, it outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Code Walkthrough**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array:
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the value of `same`.
   - Finally, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make it non-beautiful, but the problem specifies that the array is beautiful, so this case should not occur.
   - **Array with All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - **Array with Mixed Elements**: The program correctly identifies the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements and outputs it.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It handles the edge case where all elements are the same by outputting `-1`.
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements is sound.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Logic for Finding Minimum Length**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same elements.
  - However, the logic for updating `minn` and `num` is flawed. When the current element is different, it should not increment `i` before updating `num` and `minn`. This can lead to skipping elements and incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment was mostly correct but missed a critical flaw in the logic for updating `minn` and `num`.
- The corrected code addresses this issue and should now produce the correct results for all test cases.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the logic can be fixed as shown above.)
