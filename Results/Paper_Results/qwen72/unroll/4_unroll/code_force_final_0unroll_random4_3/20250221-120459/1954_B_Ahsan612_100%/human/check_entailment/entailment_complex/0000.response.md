Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by choosing an index \( i \) (2 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, `minn` to infinity, and `i` to 1.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or if no such segment exists, it outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the consecutive segments.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive segments is flawed. The program increments `i` by 1 in both branches of the `if-else` statement, which means it will skip elements that are part of the same segment.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is uniform. It should check if all elements are the same and output -1 if they are.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform but can still be made beautiful by removing elements.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To determine if the array is uniform, you can check if all elements are the same.
   - To find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful, you need to find the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve:
     - Checking if all elements are the same.
     - Finding the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
     - Ensuring that the segment found can indeed break the beautiful property when removed.

Given the issues identified, the current program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
