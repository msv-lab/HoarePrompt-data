### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. Let's break down the issues and verify the program's behavior:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows operations where `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It updates `minn` with the minimum length of these segments.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly updates `minn` and `same`.
   - Specifically, the logic for updating `num` and `i` is flawed. The program increments `i` twice in some cases, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect segment lengths.
   - The program should correctly identify the minimum segment length that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `1 2 1 2 1`, the program should output `1` because removing any one of the middle elements (index 1, 2, or 3) will make the array non-beautiful.
   - However, the program outputs `2` because it incorrectly calculates the minimum segment length.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - The program should correctly identify the minimum segment length that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It should handle the case where the array is uniform (all elements are the same) and output -1.
   - It should also handle the case where the array is not uniform and find the minimum segment length to remove.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        minn = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)
            else:
                minn = min(minn, 2)
        
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Uniform Array Check:**
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program outputs `-1`.
- **Segment Length Calculation:**
  - The program iterates through the array and checks for the condition `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
  - If the condition is met, it updates `minn` to 1 (since removing one element can make the array non-beautiful).
  - If the condition is not met, it updates `minn` to 2 (since removing two elements can make the array non-beautiful).
- **Output:**
  - If `minn` remains infinity, it means the array cannot be made non-beautiful, so the program outputs `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the program. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and we need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful.

Final: **False**
