The function `func` is expected to take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
