You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either `-1`, `p1 + p2`, or a value calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated for each iteration based on the input provided, but these variables will not retain any specific value after the loop completes. The variable `t` will be unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that satisfies certain conditions within a loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not retained. The variable `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the scores are `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws that could have happened is 2. However, the program outputs 10, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the issue:
- The scores are `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`.
- The total points are `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`, which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
- The program then calculates `low` and `high` as `min(10 - 1, 10 - 1) = 9` and `max(10 - 1, 10 - 1) = 9`.
- It initializes `cur` to 9 and enters the while loop.
- The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes `1 - 9 <= 1 - (10 - 9)`, which simplifies to `-8 <= -8`, which is true.
- The program then prints `p1 - cur + p3`, which is `1 - 9 + 10 = 2`.

However, the program should print 2 directly without entering the while loop, as the maximum number of draws is 2. The logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not correctly handle this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
