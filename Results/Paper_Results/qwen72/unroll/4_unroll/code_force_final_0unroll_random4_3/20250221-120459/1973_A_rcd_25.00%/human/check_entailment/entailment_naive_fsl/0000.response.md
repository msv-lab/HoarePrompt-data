Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the scores are `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws that could have happened is 2. However, the program outputs 10, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the issue:
- The scores are `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`.
- The total points are `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`, which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
- The program then calculates `low` and `high` as `min(10 - 1, 10 - 1) = 9` and `max(10 - 1, 10 - 1) = 9`.
- It initializes `cur` to 9 and enters the while loop.
- The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes `1 - 9 <= 1 - (10 - 9)`, which simplifies to `-8 <= -8`, which is true.
- The program then prints `p1 - cur + p3`, which is `1 - 9 + 10 = 2`.

However, the program should print 2 directly without entering the while loop, as the maximum number of draws is 2. The logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not correctly handle this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
