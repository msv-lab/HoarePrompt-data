### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct.

3. **Checking for Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score could be achieved entirely by draws, and the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - This condition is correct because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, all games could have ended in draws.

4. **Complex Logic for Draws**:
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores: `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the remaining points after `cur` draws can be distributed in a valid way.
   - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed without violating the non-decreasing order of scores.
   - However, the logic for printing the result `p1 - cur + p3` is incorrect. The correct result should be `cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Sum Check**: The sum of the scores must be even, which is correctly checked.
- **Maximum Draws for `p3 >= p1 + p2`**: This condition is correct because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, all games could have ended in draws.
- **Complex Logic for `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
  - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is more complex and involves iterating through possible values of `cur`.
  - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of scores.
  - However, the logic for printing the result `p1 - cur + p3` is incorrect. The correct result should be `cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- The corrected program should print `cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` instead of `p1 - cur + p3`.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
