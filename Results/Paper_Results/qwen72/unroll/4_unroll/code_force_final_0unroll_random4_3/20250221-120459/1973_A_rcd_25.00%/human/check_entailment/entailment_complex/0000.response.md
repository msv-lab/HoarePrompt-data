### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - It prints the result for each test case, which is either `-1` or the maximum number of draws.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **High Score Check**:
   - The function checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws is the sum of the points of the two lower-scoring players. This is correct because if `p3` is at least as large as `p1 + p2`, it's possible that all games ended in draws, and the highest score could be achieved by winning some games.

4. **Complex Calculation**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - The loop iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of the Complex Calculation:
- The loop is designed to find a value `cur` such that the remaining points after `cur` draws can be distributed in a way that satisfies the given scores.
- The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed without violating the non-decreasing order of scores.
- However, the logic inside the loop is not straightforward and might not always produce the correct result. Specifically, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not seem to correctly account for the total number of draws.

### Correctness Check:
- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0` - No games were played, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1` - One game ended in a draw. Correct output: `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1` - This is impossible because the total points (3) are odd. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2` - Two games, both ending in draws. Correct output: `2`.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3` - This is impossible because the total points (9) are odd. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5` - Six games, with the maximum number of draws being 6. Correct output: `6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10` - Two games, with the maximum number of draws being 2. Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:
The function is mostly correct, but the logic inside the loop for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not correctly account for the total number of draws. A more straightforward approach would be to directly calculate the maximum number of draws based on the total points and the constraints.

### Correctness: **False**
