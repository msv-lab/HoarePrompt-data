The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games, and they must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraint 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. It returns a result based on the scores provided.**
