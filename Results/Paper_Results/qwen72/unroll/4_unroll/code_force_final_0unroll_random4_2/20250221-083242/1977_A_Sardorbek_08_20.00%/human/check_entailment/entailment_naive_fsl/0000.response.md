Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition is incorrect because it checks if the parity of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to check if the parity of the number of moves `b` is the same as the parity of the desired number of cubes `c`.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. According to the problem, this should output "Yes" because after 5 moves, it is possible to have exactly 3 cubes in the tower. However, the program will incorrectly output "No" because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is equal to `m`, the answer is "Yes".
- If `n` is less than `m`, the answer is "No".
- If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), the answer is "Yes".
- Otherwise, the answer is "No".
