Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the initial input parameters `n` and `m`, and it does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` are in the state they were in after the last iteration of the loop, but their specific final values depend on the last input provided. **
