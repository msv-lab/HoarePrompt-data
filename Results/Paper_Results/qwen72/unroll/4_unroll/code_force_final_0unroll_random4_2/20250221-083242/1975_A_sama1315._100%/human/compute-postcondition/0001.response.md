Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

The initial state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `a`. The `input` function, now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, reads the entire input and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `data`.
