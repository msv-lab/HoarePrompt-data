Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the `input` variable now references the `sys.stdin.read` function. This means that any subsequent calls to `input` will read from the standard input until the end of the file or input stream.
