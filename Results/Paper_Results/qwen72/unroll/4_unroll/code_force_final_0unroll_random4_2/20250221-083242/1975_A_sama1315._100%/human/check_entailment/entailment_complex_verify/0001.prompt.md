You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^6 for all 0 <= i < len(a).
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: If the loop finds a segment in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it completes all iterations without returning anything. The variables `a`, `n`, `sorted_a`, and `concatenated_a` remain unchanged.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers where the length of the list is between 2 and 50, and each element is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of the list `a` concatenated with itself matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function does not modify the input list `a` or any other variables.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1

        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop, `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is the index after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result_1]  
    #[result_2]  
    #[result_3]  
    #...  
    #[result_t] (where each result_i is the result of func_1 applied to the corresponding list a, and t is the integer value of the first element in data)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them in batches, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs where each set starts with an integer `n` and is followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. For each set, the function applies `func_1` to the list `a` and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` equal to the first integer in the input, `n` equal to the last processed `n`, `a` equal to the last processed list of integers, `data` as the list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` as the index after the last processed element in `data`, and `results` as a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array, then the array can be sorted using the given operation.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Function Definition:**
     ```python
     def func_1(a):
         n = len(a)
         sorted_a = sorted(a)
         concatenated_a = a + a
         for i in range(n):
             if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
                 return 'Yes'
         return 'No'
     ```
   - **Steps:**
     - `n = len(a)`: Calculate the length of the array.
     - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: Create a sorted version of the array.
     - `concatenated_a = a + a`: Concatenate the array with itself. This helps in checking all possible splits and swaps.
     - `for i in range(n)`: Iterate through all possible starting points for the suffix.
     - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a`: Check if the subarray starting at index `i` and of length `n` (the length of the original array) is equal to the sorted array.
     - If a match is found, return 'Yes'.
     - If no match is found after all iterations, return 'No'.

   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly checks if any cyclic permutation of the array can be sorted by comparing it to the sorted version of the array.
     - The use of `concatenated_a` ensures that all possible splits and swaps are considered.
     - The function returns 'Yes' if any such permutation is found, and 'No' otherwise.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Function Definition:**
     ```python
     def func_2():
         import sys
         input = sys.stdin.read
         data = input().split()
         idx = 0
         t = int(data[idx])
         idx += 1
         results = []
         for _ in range(t):
             n = int(data[idx])
             idx += 1
             a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
             idx += n
             result = func_1(a)
             results.append(result)
         print('\n'.join(results))
     ```
   - **Steps:**
     - `import sys`: Import the `sys` module to read input from standard input.
     - `input = sys.stdin.read`: Read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.
     - `idx = 0`: Initialize an index to keep track of the current position in the input data.
     - `t = int(data[idx])`: Read the number of test cases.
     - `idx += 1`: Move the index to the next position.
     - `results = []`: Initialize a list to store the results of each test case.
     - `for _ in range(t)`: Iterate through each test case.
     - `n = int(data[idx])`: Read the length of the array for the current test case.
     - `idx += 1`: Move the index to the next position.
     - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`: Read the array elements and convert them to integers.
     - `idx += n`: Move the index to the next position.
     - `result = func_1(a)`: Call `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted.
     - `results.append(result)`: Store the result.
     - `print('\n'.join(results))`: Print all results separated by newlines.

   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will solve the problem as described. The program will correctly determine if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.

### Correctness:
**True**
