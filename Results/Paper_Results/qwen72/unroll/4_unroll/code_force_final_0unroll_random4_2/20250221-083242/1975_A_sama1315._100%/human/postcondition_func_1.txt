The function reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them in batches, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs where each set starts with an integer `n` and is followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. For each set, the function applies `func_1` to the list `a` and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` equal to the first integer in the input, `n` equal to the last processed `n`, `a` equal to the last processed list of integers, `data` as the list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` as the index after the last processed element in `data`, and `results` as a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a`.
