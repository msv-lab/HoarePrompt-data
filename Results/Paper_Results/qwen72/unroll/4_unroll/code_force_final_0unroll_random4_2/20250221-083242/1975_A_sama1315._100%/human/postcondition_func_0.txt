The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers where the length of the list is between 2 and 50, and each element is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of the list `a` concatenated with itself matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function does not modify the input list `a` or any other variables.
