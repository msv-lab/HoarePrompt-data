Output State: **The program returns -1.** 

The function is expected to return a list of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, where X is an integer input by the user. Given that the current value of `x` is 2, and there is no list of integers within the specified constraints that can have exactly 2 increasing subsequences, the program returns -1.
