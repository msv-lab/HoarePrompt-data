Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case. Specifically, the program initializes the matrix with permutations `[1, 2, ..., n]` and then applies both row and column operations using the same permutation. This approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`. The program will initialize the matrix as follows:
```
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
Then it will apply the operations:
```
1 3 1 2 3
2 3 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
2 2 1 2 3
1 1 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
```
After these operations, the matrix will be:
```
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
The sum of this matrix is `18`, but the maximum possible sum for a 3x3 matrix using the allowed operations is `27`. 

The correct approach should involve using permutations that maximize the sum of the matrix, such as filling the matrix with the largest possible values in each row and column. For example, for `n = 3`, the matrix should be:
```
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```
This would give a sum of `27`, which is the maximum possible sum. The program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
