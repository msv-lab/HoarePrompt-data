Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It calculates the sum `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it performs a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

3. **Evaluating the Formula:**
   - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - This formula simplifies to \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1) \).
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \).
   - Therefore, the formula can be expanded and simplified to:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1) = 2 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i^2 + 3 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} \right) + 3 \left( \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \right) + n
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{3} + \frac{3(n-1)n}{2} + n
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{2(n-1)n(2n-1) + 9(n-1)n + 6n}{6}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{(n-1)n(4n-2 + 9) + 6n}{6}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{(n-1)n(4n + 7) + 6n}{6}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{4n^3 + 7n^2 - 4n^2 - 7n + 6n}{6}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{4n^3 + 3n^2 - n}{6}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

4. **Evaluating the Operations:**
   - The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, totaling \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each Type 1 operation sets a row to the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - Each Type 2 operation sets a column to the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - These operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a value from 1 to \( n \), and the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - The operations used are valid and within the limit of \( 2n \).
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
