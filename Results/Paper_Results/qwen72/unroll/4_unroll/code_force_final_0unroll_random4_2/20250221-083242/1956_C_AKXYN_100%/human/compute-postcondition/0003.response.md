Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it prints the result of the formula `res = sum((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(n))` followed by `n * 2`. Additionally, it prints two lines for each integer `i` from `n` down to `1`: the first line is '1 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line is '2 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
