Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to count the number of unique XOR results with `2^31 - 1` (2147483647) that are not already in a dictionary. After processing, it prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are consumed during the function execution, and `check` is reset to `2^31 - 1` for each test case. **
