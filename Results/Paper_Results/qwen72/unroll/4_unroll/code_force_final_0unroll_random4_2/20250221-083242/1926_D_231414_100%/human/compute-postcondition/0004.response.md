The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but the actual parameters and the return value are not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, we can infer that the function likely accepts parameters related to these constraints. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_1, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

We can infer that the function might accept `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the number of integers in each test case), and a list of integers `a` (where `a` contains `n` integers).

However, since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. But typically, such functions would return a result based on the input parameters, such as a list of results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the number of integers in each test case, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided.**
