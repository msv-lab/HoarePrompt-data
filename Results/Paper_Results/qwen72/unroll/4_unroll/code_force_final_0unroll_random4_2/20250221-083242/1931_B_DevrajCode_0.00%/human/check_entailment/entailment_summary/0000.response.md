Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container must have a lower index than the destination container. The key insight is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, then the target amount of water in each container is the average of the total water.

The provided program reads the input, processes it, and calls the function `func_1` to determine if the water can be equally distributed. The function `func_1` works as follows:

1. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant.
2. It calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
3. It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running sum (`container`) of the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
4. If at any point the running sum (`container`) becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and there is no way to pour water from a container with a lower index to make up this deficit. Therefore, the function returns 'No'.
5. If the loop completes without the running sum becoming negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and the function returns 'Yes'.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program: it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is incorrect. The input should be processed one test case at a time.

Additionally, the function `func_1` should be called for each test case, and the results should be collected and printed for all test cases at the end.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
