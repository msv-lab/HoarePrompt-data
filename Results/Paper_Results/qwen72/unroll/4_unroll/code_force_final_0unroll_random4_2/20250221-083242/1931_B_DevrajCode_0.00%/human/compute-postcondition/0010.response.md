Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if it is not possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that no container (element in `a`) ever has less than the target amount of water (the average sum of elements in `a` divided by `n`), and 'Yes' if such a redistribution is possible. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged, and `container` is 0. **
