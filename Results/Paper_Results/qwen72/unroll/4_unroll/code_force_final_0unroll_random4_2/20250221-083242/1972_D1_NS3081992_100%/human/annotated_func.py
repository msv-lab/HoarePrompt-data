#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it. It does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer has been read from the user and is available as the return value of the function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input (stdin) and returns an iterator that yields each integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

    #State: `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), where the elements at the indices `di - 1` (for each `di` in `d[da]`) have been temporarily set to 1 and then reset to 0. `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` for each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. This value is also stored in `rank[da - 1]`. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` remain unchanged except for the value stored in `rank[da - 1]`. The list `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the function.

    #State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and b is not equal to 0.
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `y` is the second value returned by `func_13`, `x - a // b * y` is calculated using the first value returned by `func_13` (which is `x`), and `g` is the third value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified bounds. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The function is designed to compute and return values related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and, for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
