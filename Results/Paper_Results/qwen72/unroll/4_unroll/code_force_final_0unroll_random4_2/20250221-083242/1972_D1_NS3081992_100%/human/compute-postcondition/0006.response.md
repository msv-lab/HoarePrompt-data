The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer. The function returns 1 in one case and -1 in another case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 in one case and -1 in another case.**
