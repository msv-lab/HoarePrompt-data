You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' and stops further checks for that test case. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will retain their final values from the last test case, and `tests` will remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if there is any character in `c` that is not present in `a` or `b`, and if so, it prints "YES". This logic is flawed because it does not consider the conditions for matching the template as described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

According to the problem description, there should be a template that `a` and `b` match, but `c` does not. However, the program will print "NO" because there is no character in `c` that is not present in `a` or `b`. This is incorrect because a valid template could be "ABC", where all characters in `a` and `b` are different from their uppercase counterparts, and all characters in `c` are different from their uppercase counterparts, thus `c` does not match the template.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if for each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are the same.
2. For each position `i`, ensure that the character in `c` is different from the character in `a` and `b` if the template character at that position is uppercase.
3. Ensure that the template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.

The provided program does not perform these checks and thus is incorrect.
