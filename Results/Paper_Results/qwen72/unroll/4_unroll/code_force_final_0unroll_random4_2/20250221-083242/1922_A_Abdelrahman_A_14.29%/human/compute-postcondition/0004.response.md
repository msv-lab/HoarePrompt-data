Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' and stops further checks for that test case. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will retain their final values from the last test case, and `tests` will remain unchanged. **
