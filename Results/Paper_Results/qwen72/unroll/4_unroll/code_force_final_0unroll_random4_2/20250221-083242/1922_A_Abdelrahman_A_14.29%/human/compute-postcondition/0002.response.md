Output State: **The loop will execute `tests` times, and for each iteration, it will read `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will check if any character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it will print 'YES' and break out of the inner loop. If no such character is found, it will print 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will have their final values based on the last test case, and `tests` will remain unchanged.**
