The only variables in the loop head are `t` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state of `t` is not specified, but it must be adjusted to start from 0 for the loop to iterate correctly.

State: **`t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
