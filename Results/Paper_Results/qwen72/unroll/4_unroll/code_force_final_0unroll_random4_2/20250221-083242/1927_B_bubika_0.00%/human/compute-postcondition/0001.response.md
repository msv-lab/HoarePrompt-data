Output State: **The function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a`, where each inner list contains `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. Each inner list `a` corresponds to a test case, and the length `n` of each trace satisfies (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the variable `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The variable `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**
