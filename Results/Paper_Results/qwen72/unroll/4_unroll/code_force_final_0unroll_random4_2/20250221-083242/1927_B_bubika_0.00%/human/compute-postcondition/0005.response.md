Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. The function constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a character in the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') based on the current count of each character stored in the list `b`. The constructed string `r` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the list `b` contains the counts of how many times each character in the alphabet was used to construct the output strings, and the string `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The function does not return any value. **
