The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists a, where each inner list contains n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. Each inner list a corresponds to a test case, and the length n of each trace satisfies (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
