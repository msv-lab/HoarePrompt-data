Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. The function checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and moves to the next test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `l`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
