Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost by sorting the prices and then selecting the first `q` days to buy tickets. However, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed.
   - The program assumes that the cost for the first `q` days is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which is incorrect. The second term `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is meant to account for the increase in prices due to purchasing tickets, but it does not correctly handle the dynamic price increases.

2. **Handling Remaining Tickets**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining tickets (`mu`) after purchasing `m` tickets on each of the first `q-1` days. The cost calculation for the remaining tickets is also flawed.

3. **Price Increase Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic for increasing the prices of subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on a given day. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, but the program does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use a more dynamic approach to account for the price increases. One effective way is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy the cheapest available tickets while keeping track of the price increases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def minimum_cost(t, cases):
    results = []
    for n, m, k, prices in cases:
        m = min(m, k)
        prices = [(-p, 0) for p in prices]  # Use negative prices to simulate a min-heap
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        total_cost = 0
        while k > 0:
            p, x = heapq.heappop(prices)
            buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += -p * buy
            k -= buy
            x += buy
            if x < m:
                heapq.heappush(prices, (p - x, x))
        results.append(total_cost)
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, prices))

# Solving and printing results
for result in minimum_cost(t, cases):
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - We initialize a min-heap with the prices and a zero increase counter for each day.
   - We use negative prices to simulate a min-heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min-heap by default.

2. **Buying Tickets**:
   - We repeatedly buy the cheapest available tickets (up to `m` tickets per day) and update the total cost.
   - We also update the price increase for the day and push it back into the heap if there are still tickets to be bought on that day.

3. **Output**:
   - After all tickets are bought, we print the total cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the price increases and finds the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.
