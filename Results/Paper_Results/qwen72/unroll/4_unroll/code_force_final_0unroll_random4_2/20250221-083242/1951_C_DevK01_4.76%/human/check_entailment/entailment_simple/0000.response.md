### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and stores them in the list `L`.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `M` for the `n` days.

2. **Adjusting `m` to be at most `k`:**
   - The line `m = min(m, k)` ensures that `m` does not exceed `k`, which is necessary because you cannot buy more tickets per day than you need.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The variable `q` is calculated as `math.ceil(k / m)`, which represents the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given that you can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The list `N` is created by taking the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M`. These are the days with the lowest ticket prices.

6. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days (i.e., `n * m`) is exactly equal to `k`, then the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase after each purchase.
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, it means that the last day will have a different number of tickets bought (`mu`).
     - `w` is the price on the last day, which is removed from `N`.
     - `mu` is the number of tickets bought on the last day, calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` for the last day, plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining days, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.

7. **Output and Continuation:**
   - The calculated cost is printed for each test case.
   - The `continue` statement is unnecessary and can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints and the price increase after each purchase. The sorting of the prices and the calculation of the cost are both done in a way that ensures the minimum possible expenditure.

**Correctness: **True****

However, there is a minor issue with the variable `n` being reused, which might cause confusion. The variable `n` is initially the number of days, but it is later reassigned to the length of `N`. This is not incorrect, but it could be more clear if a different variable name was used for the length of `N`.

Additionally, the `continue` statement is redundant and can be removed to make the code cleaner.

### Improved Version:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        prices.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        cheapest_days = prices[:q]
        
        if q * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(cheapest_days) + m * m * ((q - 1) * q // 2)
        else:
            last_day_price = cheapest_days.pop()
            remaining_tickets = k - (q - 1) * m
            cost = remaining_tickets * last_day_price
            cost += m * sum(cheapest_days) + m * m * ((q - 1) * (q - 2) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * remaining_tickets
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

This version is more readable and avoids the reuse of the variable `n`.
