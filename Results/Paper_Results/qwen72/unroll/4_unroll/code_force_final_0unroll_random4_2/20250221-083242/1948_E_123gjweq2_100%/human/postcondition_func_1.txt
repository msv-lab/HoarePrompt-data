The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies two external arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the subarray `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with values in a specific pattern. The first half of the subarray (from `left` to `left + mid - 1`) is filled with values starting from `left + 1` and increasing by 1, while the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) is filled with values starting from `right + 1` and decreasing by 1. The subarray `cliquess[left:right + 1]` is filled entirely with the value `clique`. The function does not return any value.
