### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because the maximum number of vertices that can be in a single clique is `k`, and the minimum number of cliques required is the ceiling of `n / k`.
   - **Array Initialization:**
     - Two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to store the assigned integers and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - **Segment Filling:**
     - The program divides the vertices into segments of size `k` and assigns each segment a different integer starting from 1.
     - The function `make_array` is called to fill the segments.

3. **Function `make_array`:**
   - **Subarray Bounds:**
     - The function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
     - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` as the starting and ending values for the segment.
   - **Mid Calculation:**
     - `mid` is calculated as the length of the first half of the segment.
   - **Filling the Subarray:**
     - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
     - The second half of the segment is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
     - Both halves are assigned the same clique number.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each test case.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the output: the `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly. The `cliquess` array is supposed to store the clique assignments, but it is initialized to all zeros and remains unchanged.

### Issues:
- **Clique Assignment:**
  - The `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly. The function `make_array` should update the `cliquess` array to reflect the correct clique assignments for each vertex.

### Correctness:
- **False** because the `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect clique assignments being printed.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, the `cliquess` array should be updated within the `make_array` function to reflect the correct clique assignments.

```python
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
    
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + mid - i - 1] = clique
    
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

### Correctness:
- **True** after the correction, the program will correctly update the `cliquess` array and print the correct clique assignments.
