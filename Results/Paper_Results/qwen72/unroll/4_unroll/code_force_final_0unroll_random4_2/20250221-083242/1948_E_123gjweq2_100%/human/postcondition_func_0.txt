The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k` and divides the array `arr` of length `n` into segments of size `k`, filling each segment with a different integer starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each subsequent segment. If the last segment is smaller than `k`, it will be filled with the last integer value. The function prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` is modified as described, and `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros.
