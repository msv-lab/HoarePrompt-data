### Reasoning:

1. **Overall Structure and Flow**:
   - The program reads a number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, k)`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques required and then calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - Finally, `func_1` prints the results: the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because each clique can contain at most `k` vertices, and if `n` is not divisible by `k`, an additional clique is needed.
   - **Array Initialization**: `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to lists of zeros of length `n`.
   - **Segment Filling**: The function iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - **Segment Definition**: The function defines the segment from `left` to `right` and calculates the middle point `mid`.
   - **Filling Pattern**:
     - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
     - The second half of the segment is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
     - The `cliquess` array is filled with the `clique` value for the entire segment.
   - **Output**: The function modifies the global arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not return any value.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - **Array `arr`**: The array `arr` is filled with distinct integers from 1 to `n` in a pattern that ensures the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is met for vertices within the same clique.
   - **Number of Cliques**: The number of cliques is correctly calculated and printed.
   - **Array `cliquess`**: The array `cliquess` correctly assigns each vertex to a clique, ensuring that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is not divisible by `k` by using the ceiling function to ensure the correct number of cliques.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is larger than `n` by creating a single clique for all vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement. The logic and output are consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
