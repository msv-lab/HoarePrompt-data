The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[left:left + mid]` is filled with values starting from `small_element` and increasing by 1 for each subsequent element, and the subarray `cliques[left:left + mid]` is filled with the value `clique`. However, these details do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr[left:left + mid]` is filled with values starting from `small_element` and increasing by 1 for each subsequent element, `cliquess[left:left + mid]` is filled with the value `clique`, `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged, `i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**
