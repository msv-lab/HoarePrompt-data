### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\), which is the length of the permutation.

3. **First Loop**:
   - The variable `v1` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it compares \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, `v1` is updated to \(i\).
   - This loop effectively finds the index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation.

4. **Second Loop**:
   - The variable `prev` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it compares \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\).
   - If \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) is greater, `prev` is updated to \(i\).
   - If the results are equal, it makes an additional query to compare \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_{prev} \mid p_{prev}\) to ensure the correct update of `prev`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loops, the function outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

6. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes at most \(2(n-1)\) queries (one for each comparison and potentially one additional comparison if the results are equal).
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is at most \(3(n-1)\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The first loop ensures that `v1` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop ensures that `prev` is the index of the value that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum result.
   - The additional query in the second loop ensures that the correct index is chosen even if the bitwise OR results are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds a pair of indices \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries. The logic and the number of queries are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
