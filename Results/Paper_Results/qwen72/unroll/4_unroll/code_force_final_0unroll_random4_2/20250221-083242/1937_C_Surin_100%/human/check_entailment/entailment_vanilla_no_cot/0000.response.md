Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the size of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` and `p[v1]` with the bitwise OR of `p[i]` and `p[i]` using the query `? {v1} {v1} {i} {i}`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`, meaning `p[i]` has a higher value than `p[v1]`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` and `p[i]` with the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` and `p[prev]` using the query `? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`, meaning `p[i]` has a higher value when ORed with `p[v1]` than `p[prev]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further checks the bitwise OR of `p[i]` and `p[i]` with the bitwise OR of `p[prev]` and `p[prev]` using the query `? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}` to ensure `prev` is updated correctly.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After the iterations, the program outputs the pair of indices `! {prev} {v1}` which should maximize the bitwise XOR `p[prev] \oplus p[v1]`.

The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of `3n` by making at most `2n` queries (one for finding `v1` and another for finding `prev`). The logic for updating `v1` and `prev` is sound and should correctly identify the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
