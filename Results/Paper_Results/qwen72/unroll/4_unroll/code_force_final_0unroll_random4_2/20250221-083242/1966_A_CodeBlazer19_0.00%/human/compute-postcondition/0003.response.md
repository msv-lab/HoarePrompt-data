The function `func` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `numbers`, an integer `n`, and an integer `k`. The list `numbers` represents the numbers on the cards, `n` represents the number of cards, and `k` represents the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each element in `numbers` should satisfy 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.

The function returns the maximum possible sum of the numbers on the cards after performing the exchange operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`, an integer `n`, and an integer `k`. It returns the maximum possible sum of the numbers on the cards after performing the specified number of exchange operations.**
