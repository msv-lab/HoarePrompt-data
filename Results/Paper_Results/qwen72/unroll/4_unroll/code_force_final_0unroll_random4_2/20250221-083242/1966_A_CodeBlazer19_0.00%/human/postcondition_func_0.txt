The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `n` and `l` (the list of integers) are read but not used in the function's operations.
