Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where Kirill is already in the first m positions. In such a case, the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend should be 0, but the program does not account for this scenario. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 4
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Here, Kirill is already in the 4th position, which is within the first 4 positions (m = 4). Therefore, the expected output should be 0, but the program will output a non-zero value because it always tries to move Kirill to a position within the first m, even if he is already there.
