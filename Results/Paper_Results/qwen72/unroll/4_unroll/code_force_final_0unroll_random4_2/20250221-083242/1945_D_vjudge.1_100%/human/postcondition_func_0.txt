The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` with each element between 1 and 10^9. The function computes the minimum value of the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` and the suffix sums of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. It prints this minimum value, which represents the smallest possible sum of `a[i]` and the sum of the minimum values from `a[i+1]` to `a[n-1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. The function does not return any value.
