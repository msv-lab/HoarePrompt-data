### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, a list `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct because it ensures that Kirill will pay the minimum possible cost to move to any position `j` where `j < i`.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - A suffix sum array `suff` is created to store the cumulative sum of the elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is done using a loop that iterates from `n-1` to `0`. The suffix sum is correctly calculated and stored in `suff`.

4. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to ensure that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The program then iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any of these positions. The cost is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which represents the cost to move to position `i` plus the cost to move past all positions from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - The minimum value of these costs is stored in `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `k` people in the queue.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and follows the problem description.
- The use of suffix sums and the minimum cost calculation ensures that the program finds the optimal solution efficiently.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
