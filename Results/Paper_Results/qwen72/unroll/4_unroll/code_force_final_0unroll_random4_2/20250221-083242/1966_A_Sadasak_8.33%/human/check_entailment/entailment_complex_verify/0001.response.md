### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation). This is correct.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange all `k` cards for `k - 1` new cards, leaving you with `k - 1` cards. This is also correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` and updates the frequency of each number.
   - If the frequency of a number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k` (this is to ensure that the frequency table only contains counts up to `k`). This is correct.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program checks if any value in the frequency table is exactly `k`.
   - If a value is `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to reduce the number of cards by 1. This is correct.
   - If no value is `k`, it prints `n` (this is incorrect).

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of cards can be reduced further even if no single number has a frequency of exactly `k`.
- The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. It should consider the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing operations on groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, the program should:
  - Calculate the frequency of each card number.
  - Determine the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing operations on groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.
  - The minimum number of cards left can be calculated by repeatedly performing the operation until no more groups of `k` cards with the same number are available.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `5 3`, `4 1 1 4 4`
  - Frequency Table: `{4: 3, 1: 2}`
  - The program correctly identifies that there are 3 cards with the number 4 and prints `2` (since 3 cards can be exchanged for 2 new cards).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 10`, `7`
  - Frequency Table: `{7: 1}`
  - The program correctly prints `1` because no operations can be performed.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `7 2`, `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
  - Frequency Table: `{4: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 100: 1, 5: 1, 3: 1}`
  - The program correctly identifies that there are 2 cards with the number 2 and prints `1` (since 2 cards can be exchanged for 1 new card).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `10 4`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Frequency Table: `{1: 4}`
  - The program correctly identifies that there are 4 cards with the number 1 and prints `3` (since 4 cards can be exchanged for 3 new cards).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `5 2`, `3 8 1 48 7`
  - Frequency Table: `{3: 1, 8: 1, 1: 1, 48: 1, 7: 1}`
  - The program incorrectly prints `5` because it does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations. The correct output should be `1` (since 2 cards can be exchanged for 1 new card, and this can be done multiple times).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `6 2`, `10 20 30 10 20 40`
  - Frequency Table: `{10: 2, 20: 2, 30: 1, 40: 1}`
  - The program correctly identifies that there are 2 cards with the number 10 and 2 cards with the number 20, and prints `1` (since 2 cards can be exchanged for 1 new card, and this can be done twice).

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `10 20 30 10 20 40`
  - Frequency Table: `{10: 2, 20: 2, 30: 1, 40: 1}`
  - The program incorrectly prints `6` because it does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations. The correct output should be `6` (since no group of 3 cards with the same number is available).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the reduction of cards in all possible scenarios, especially when multiple operations can be performed on different groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.

### Final:
Final: **False**
