The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100; and `k`, which is an integer between 2 and 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but capped at `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but capped at `k`.**
