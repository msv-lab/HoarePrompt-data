The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of `u2vs` being a list of `n` empty lists is already sufficient for the loop to start, as it does not directly affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
