Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, both consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then compares the digits of `a` and `b` at each position. If the digits are the same, they are included in both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits differ, the lexicographically smaller digit is included in `kq1` and the lexicographically larger digit is included in `kq2`. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
