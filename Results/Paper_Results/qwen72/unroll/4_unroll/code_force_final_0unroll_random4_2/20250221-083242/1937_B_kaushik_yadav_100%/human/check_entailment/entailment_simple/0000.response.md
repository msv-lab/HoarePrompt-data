### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses a variable `work` to determine whether the grasshopper should prefer moving right along the top row or switch to the bottom row.
   - The loop iterates through each character in the string `a`:
     - If `work` is `True`, the program appends the current character of `a` to `ans`.
     - It checks if the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`. If so, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If it reaches the end of the string `a`, it appends the last character of `b` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it moves to the next character in `a`.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, indicating that there is at least one path.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If the next character in `a` is equal to the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If the next character in `a` is not equal to the current character in `b` and the conditions for incrementing or resetting the counter are not met, it breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Path Construction:**
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program ensures that the grasshopper moves to the bottom row only when it is lexicographically beneficial to do so.
  - The condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` ensures that the grasshopper switches to the bottom row if the next character in `b` is smaller than the next character in `a`.

- **Path Counting:**
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. The program correctly identifies the positions where the grasshopper can switch between rows without changing the lexicographical order of the string.
  - The counter is incremented when the next character in `a` is equal to the current character in `b`, and it is reset when the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', which ensures that the count is accurate for the lexicographically smallest string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string. The input handling, path construction, and path counting are all done correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
