Reasoning:

1. **Path Construction**:
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by starting from the top-left cell and moving right or down. It prioritizes moving right along the top row (`a`) until it finds a point where the next cell in `a` is greater than the current cell in `b`. At this point, it switches to moving down and then continues moving right along the bottom row (`b`).
   - This approach ensures that the program always takes the smallest possible value at each step, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The program counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by checking the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'.
   - This is correct because the grasshopper can switch rows at any point where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` without changing the lexicographical order. Additionally, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the grasshopper must switch to the bottom row to maintain the smallest string, and the counter resets.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` by adding the last character from `b` to the result string `ans` and breaking out of the loop.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the grasshopper can switch rows at the last column.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
