Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0101
0011
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00001
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
00011
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string should be "00001" because the grasshopper can take the path (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) or (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4).
- The program incorrectly outputs "00011" because it does not correctly handle the transition between the two rows to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.

The issue lies in the condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:` which does not always ensure the lexicographically smallest string. Additionally, the counter logic does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the smallest string.
