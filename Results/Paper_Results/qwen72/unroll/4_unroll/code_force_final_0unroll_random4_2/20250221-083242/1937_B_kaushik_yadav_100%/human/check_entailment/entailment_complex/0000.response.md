### Reasoning:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction:**
   - The function constructs the lexicographically smallest string by iterating through the grid and choosing the minimum value between the current cell in the top row and the next cell in the bottom row.
   - The variable `work` is used to decide whether to continue taking characters from the top row (`a`) or switch to the bottom row (`b`).
   - The loop ensures that the grasshopper takes the smallest possible value at each step, which is correct for finding the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Path Count Calculation:**
   - The path count is calculated by checking how many times the grasshopper can switch between the top and bottom rows while still maintaining the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The variable `counter` is incremented for each position where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'.
   - This logic is correct because it counts the number of valid positions where the grasshopper can switch rows without changing the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the grid is of size \(2 \times n\) and \(n\) can be as large as \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper reaches the end of the grid and ensures that the final character is added correctly.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the lexicographically smallest string followed by the number of paths that yield this string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
