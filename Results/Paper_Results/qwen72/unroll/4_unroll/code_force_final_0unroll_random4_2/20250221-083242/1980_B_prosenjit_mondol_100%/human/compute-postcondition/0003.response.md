Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, and two indices `f` and `k` (both 1-based), followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the element at index `f` (0-based) in the original list is greater than, less than, or equal to the element at index `k` (0-based) in the sorted list (in descending order). If the element at `f` is greater than the element at `k` in the sorted list, it prints 'NO'. If it is less, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' if `k` is the last index of the sorted list or the next element in the sorted list is less than the element at `f`, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value. **
