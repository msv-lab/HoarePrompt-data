Output State: **The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` retain their initial values for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `cnt` is reset to 0 and `cur` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations of the outer loop, the final values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a string `ans` for each test case.**
