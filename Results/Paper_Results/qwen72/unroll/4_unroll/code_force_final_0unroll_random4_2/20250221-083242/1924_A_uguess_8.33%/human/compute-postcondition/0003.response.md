The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it implies that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The constraints also indicate that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. Additionally, the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Since the function does not explicitly accept any parameters and the output is not provided, we can only infer that the function likely processes these internally generated or predefined values and returns some result based on them. However, without further details on the output, we cannot specify what the function returns.
