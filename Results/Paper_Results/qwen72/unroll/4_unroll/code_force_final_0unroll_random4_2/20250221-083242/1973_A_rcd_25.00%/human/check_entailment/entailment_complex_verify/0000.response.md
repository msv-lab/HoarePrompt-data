Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine if the assessment is accurate.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Validation**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \).

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - If the sum of the scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules (since each game results in an even number of points being distributed).
   - The program correctly prints `-1` in this case.

3. **High Score Check**:
   - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the highest score \( p_3 \) can be achieved by having all the draws between the two lower-scoring players.
   - The program correctly prints \( p_1 + p_2 \) in this case.

4. **Complex Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions holds, the program enters a more complex logic to calculate the maximum number of draws.
   - The program calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between \( p_3 \) and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that \( p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p_3 - cur) \).
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints \( p_1 - cur + p_3 \).
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints \( p_3 \).

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where the scores are `1 2 3`. The correct output for this case should be `2`, but the program outputs `3`.

### Analysis of the Case `1 2 3`
- **Sum Check**:
  - \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \), which is even. The scores are consistent with the rules.
- **High Score Check**:
  - \( p_3 = 3 \) and \( p_1 + p_2 = 3 \), so \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \) is true.
  - According to the program, it should print \( p_1 + p_2 = 3 \).

However, the correct output for `1 2 3` should indeed be `2`, not `3`. Let's see why:

- **Possible Games**:
  - Two draws: `1 1 2` (both players get 1 point each in each draw).
  - One win/loss game: `1 2 3` (the third player wins against the second player).

### Correcting the Logic
The program's logic for the complex case is flawed. It should not print \( p_1 + p_2 \) directly when \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \). Instead, it should calculate the maximum number of draws that can be achieved while ensuring the scores are consistent.

### Corrected Program
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p_3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            draws = (p1 + p2) // 2
            if p3 - draws * 2 >= 0:
                print(draws)
            else:
                print(-1)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
            max_wins = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
            draws = (total_points - 2 * max_wins) // 2
            if max_wins * 2 + draws * 2 == total_points:
                print(draws)
            else:
                print(-1)
```

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case `1 2 3` correctly. The program outputs `3` instead of `2`, which is the maximum number of draws that can be achieved.

Final: **False**
