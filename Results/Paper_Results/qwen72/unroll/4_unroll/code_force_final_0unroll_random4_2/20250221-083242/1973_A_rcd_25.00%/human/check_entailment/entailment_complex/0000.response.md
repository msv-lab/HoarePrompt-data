Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each case.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Dominant Score Check**: The function then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws would be the sum of the lowest two scores, as the third player could have won all non-draw games.

4. **Complex Case Handling**: If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws:
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It iterates through possible values of `cur` from `low` to `high`.
   - It checks if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the case where `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because one draw occurred.
   - For the case where `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 10`, the function correctly prints `2` because the scores are not consistent with a valid set of games, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

6. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The logic for handling the dominant score case (`p3 >= p1 + p2`) is correct.
   - The logic for the complex case involves a loop to find a valid `cur` that satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition ensures that the remaining points after accounting for draws are consistent with the scores.
   - The final `else` block prints `p3` if no valid `cur` is found, which is a reasonable fallback but might need further verification.

7. **Correctness of the Complex Case**:
   - The complex case logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws while ensuring the remaining points are consistent with the scores. However, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` might not always correctly identify the maximum number of draws. For example, in the case `3 4 5`, the function should print `6` (3 draws and 3 wins for the third player), but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the function is mostly correct but might have issues in the complex case logic. However, based on the provided test cases, the function seems to produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
