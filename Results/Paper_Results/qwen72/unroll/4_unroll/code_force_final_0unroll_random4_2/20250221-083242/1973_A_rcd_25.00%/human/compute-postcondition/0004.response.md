Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players, with the constraint that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30. The function then checks the following conditions for each test case:
- If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`.
- If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
- Otherwise, it calculates a value that satisfies certain conditions and prints either `p1 - cur + p3` or `p3`, where `cur` is a calculated value that ensures the conditions are met. The function does not modify the input scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed. **
