You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue

            print(p1 + p2)

            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players after all games have been played.

    t = int(input())

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())

            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 remain unchanged, and t is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players, with the constraint that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30. The function then checks the following conditions for each test case:
- If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`.
- If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
- Otherwise, it calculates a value that satisfies certain conditions and prints either `p1 - cur + p3` or `p3`, where `cur` is a calculated value that ensures the conditions are met. The function does not modify the input scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws is less than the sum of the minimum scores. For example, consider the input `1 2 3`. The correct output should be `2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

Let's break down the issue with the input `1 2 3`:
- The total points are `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is even, so the scores are consistent with the rules.
- The maximum number of draws should be the sum of the minimum scores, which is `1 + 2 = 3` (since each draw gives 1 point to each player).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as `3`, which is not the maximum possible number of draws.

The correct output for `1 2 3` should be `2`, because the only way to achieve these scores is with 2 draws and 1 win/loss game:
- Two draws: `1 1 2` (both players get 1 point each in each draw).
- One win/loss game: `1 2 3` (the third player wins against the second player).

Thus, the program is incorrect.
