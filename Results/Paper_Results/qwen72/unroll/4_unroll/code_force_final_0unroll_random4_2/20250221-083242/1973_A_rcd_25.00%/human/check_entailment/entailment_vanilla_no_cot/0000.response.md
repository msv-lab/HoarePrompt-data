Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total score is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

2. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - The program prints `p1 + p2` when `p3 >= p1 + p2`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of draws. For example, if `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the program should print `1` (one draw between the second and third players), but it prints `1` which is not the maximum number of draws.

3. **General Case**:
   - The logic in the `else` block is flawed. It attempts to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, but this does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The program should instead focus on the total number of points and the distribution of wins and draws.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- The total number of points must be even.
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by distributing the points such that the total number of games (wins + draws) is minimized, and the remaining points are distributed as draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # The maximum number of draws is the total points divided by 2
        max_draws = total_points // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are consistent with the maximum number of draws
        if max_draws > p3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Points Check**: Ensure the total points are even.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is `total_points // 2` because each draw contributes 2 points.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure that the maximum number of draws does not exceed the highest score `p3`. If it does, the scores are inconsistent, and we print `-1`.

This corrected program will correctly determine the maximum number of draws for the given test cases.
