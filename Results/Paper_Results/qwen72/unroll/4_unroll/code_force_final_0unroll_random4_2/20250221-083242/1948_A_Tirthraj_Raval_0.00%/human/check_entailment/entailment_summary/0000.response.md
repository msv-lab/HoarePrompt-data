Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the problem by checking if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by alternating 'A' and 'B'. This ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, thus making all `n` characters special. The length of the constructed string is `n`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
