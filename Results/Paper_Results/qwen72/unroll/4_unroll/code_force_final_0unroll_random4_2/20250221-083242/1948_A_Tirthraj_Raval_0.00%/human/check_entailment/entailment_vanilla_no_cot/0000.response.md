Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, there is no string that can satisfy the condition of having exactly `n` special characters. This is because special characters must come in pairs (each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, so they must be in pairs like "AA", "BB", etc.). Therefore, the program prints "NO" for odd `n`.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the program constructs a string that satisfies the condition. It does this by creating a pattern of alternating pairs of characters "A" and "B". For example, if `n` is 6, the pattern will be "ABABAB". Each "A" is followed by a "B" and each "B" is followed by an "A", ensuring that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times. In each iteration, it appends two characters to the pattern: the first character is "A" or "B" based on `i % 2`, and the second character is the opposite of the first (using `i % 2 ^ 1` to flip the bit).

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for even `n`.

6. **String Length**: The constructed string has a length of `n`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
