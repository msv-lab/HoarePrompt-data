### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Special characters always come in pairs (e.g., AA, BB).

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`.
   - The pattern is generated using a loop that appends 'A' and 'B' alternately to the `pattern` list.
   - The loop runs `n // 2` times, ensuring that the resulting string has exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Pattern Generation**:
   - The pattern generation logic is correct. For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be `ABABAB`, which has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6).

5. **Output Constraints**:
   - The function ensures that the output string is of length at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and generates the required output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
