Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This matches the problem description.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: For `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buys the remaining yogurt(s) at the regular price.
     - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the pairs of yogurts.
     - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for the remaining yogurt(s) if `n` is odd.

4. **Output**: The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`. This ensures that Maxim spends the least amount of burles.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, so `ans2` will be `b * n // 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, so `ans2` will be `b * n // 2 + a`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
     - Output: `9` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 2 = 14`
     - Output: `14` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 2 = 18`
     - Output: `15` (Correct)
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
     - Output: `20` (Correct)

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
