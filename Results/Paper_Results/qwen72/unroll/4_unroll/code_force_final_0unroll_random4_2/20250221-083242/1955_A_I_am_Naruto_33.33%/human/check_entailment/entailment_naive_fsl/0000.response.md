Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It first checks if the number of yogurts `n` is greater than 1. If so, it calculates two possible costs: buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1`) and buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2`). It then prints the minimum of these two costs. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`). This logic ensures that the program always finds the minimum cost for any valid input within the specified constraints.
