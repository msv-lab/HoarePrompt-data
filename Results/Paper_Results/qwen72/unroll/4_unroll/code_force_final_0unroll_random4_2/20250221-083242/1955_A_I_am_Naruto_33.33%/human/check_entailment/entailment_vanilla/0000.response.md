### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price.
   - This is correct because the promotion price `b` is only applicable when buying two or more yogurts.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Cost:**
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n > 1`, it ensures that the promotion price is used optimally by buying pairs of yogurts and then any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - `min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - `min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - `min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - `min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound for the problem description. It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.
