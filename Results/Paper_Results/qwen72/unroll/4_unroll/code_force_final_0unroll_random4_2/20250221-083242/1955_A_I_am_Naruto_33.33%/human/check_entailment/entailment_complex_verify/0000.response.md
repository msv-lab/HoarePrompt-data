Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **When `n == 1`**: The program prints `a`, which is the correct cost for buying one yogurt. This is straightforward and matches the problem's requirement.
   - **When `n > 1`**: The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
     - It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

3. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` is correct:
     - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
     - Multiplying `b` by the number of pairs and `a` by the number of remaining yogurts ensures that the total cost is calculated correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` by directly printing `a`.
   - For other values of `n`, the program correctly computes the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

5. **Example Validation**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - The minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - The minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - The minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - The minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

Given the above reasoning and validation, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given constraints and conditions.

Final: **True**
