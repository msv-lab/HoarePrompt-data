### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is composed of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is composed of the last character of each row.
   - These strings are used to check if the first and last columns are consistent in color.

3. **Consistency Checks:**
   - The function checks if the first row is entirely one color (using `len(set(a[0])) == 1`).
   - If the first row is entirely one color and it is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`), it prints "NO" because it would be impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column (represented by `first_row`) is entirely one color.
   - If the first column is entirely one color and it is different from the last column (`first_row != last_row`), it prints "NO" for the same reason.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES" because it is possible to make all squares the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The function correctly identifies that if the first row or the first column is entirely one color and different from the last row or the last column, respectively, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
  - However, the function does not check the entire grid for consistency. It only checks the first and last rows and columns.
  - This approach is sufficient because if the first and last rows or columns are not consistent, it is impossible to make the entire grid consistent. Conversely, if they are consistent, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where the grid is already entirely one color (e.g., a 1x1 grid or a grid where all rows and columns are consistent).
  - It also handles the case where the grid is not entirely one color but can be made consistent by the operations described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints. It correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by checking the consistency of the first and last rows and columns.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
