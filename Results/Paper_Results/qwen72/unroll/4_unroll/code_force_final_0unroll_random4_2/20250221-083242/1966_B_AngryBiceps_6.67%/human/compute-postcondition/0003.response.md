Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to stdout for each test case. Each test case consists of a grid of dimensions `n` x `m` with cells colored 'W' or 'B'. The function checks if the first row and the first column of the grid are uniform in color and if they are different from the last row and the last column, respectively. If these conditions are met, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will hold the values corresponding to the last test case processed. **
