Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of elements in array `b` is exactly equal to `n`. In such a case, the program incorrectly uses `b[-(n - i)]` which will access elements out of the valid range of `b`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 4
1 2 3 4
10 9 8 7
```
The program will attempt to access `b[-(4 - 0)]` which is `b[-4]`, but since `b` has only 4 elements, this will access the first element of `b` (which is 10), not the last element as intended. This will lead to incorrect calculations of the differences.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it correctly accesses the elements of `b` when `m == n`. The correct approach would be to use `b[i]` instead of `b[-(n - i)]` when `m == n`.
