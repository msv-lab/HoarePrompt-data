You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process game scenarios, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). Each of these parameters should be integers, with h and w representing the height and width of the board, respectively, and (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9 must be satisfied, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing input scenarios for Alice's and Bob's chips on a board of dimensions (r, w) with initial positions (a, b) and (c, d). For each iteration, if `a` is greater than `c`, the output is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the loop calculates the positions and determines the winner based on the conditions provided. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are reset for each iteration, and the variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The initial values of `h`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` which represent the height of the board, width of the board, Alice's initial position, and Bob's initial position respectively.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The function checks if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If `a > c`, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet if Alice starts below Bob.

3. **Move Calculation:**
   - If `a <= c`, the function calculates the number of moves `x` required for Alice and Bob to potentially meet. This is done using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The function then checks if the number of moves is odd or even to determine the player who will make the final move.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), Alice will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's initial column `b` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `b` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If so, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is even, Bob will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's initial column `d` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `d` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x`. If so, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for determining the number of moves and the range of possible meeting columns is correct.
- The conditions for checking if Alice or Bob can win are also correct. Alice can win if she can move to a column where Bob is or will be, and Bob can win if he can move to a column where Alice is or will be.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that they cannot meet within the board boundaries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and conditions as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
