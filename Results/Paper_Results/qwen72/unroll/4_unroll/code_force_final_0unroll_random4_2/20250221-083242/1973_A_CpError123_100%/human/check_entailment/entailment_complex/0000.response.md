Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The key points to consider are:

1. **Sum of Scores**: The total points (sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`) must be even because each game either results in 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated as the minimum of two values:
   - `(a + b + c) // 2`: This represents the total number of games played, assuming all games were draws. Since each draw awards 2 points, the total number of draws is half the total points.
   - `a + b`: This represents the maximum number of draws that can occur without exceeding the scores of the two lower-scoring players. If the sum of the scores of the two lower-scoring players is less than the total number of games, then the maximum number of draws is limited by `a + b`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no games were played, the scores are all zero, and the function correctly prints `0`.
   - If the scores are such that no valid set of games can achieve them, the function correctly prints `-1`.

Let's analyze the function step-by-step:

- **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
- **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws as the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`.

The function's logic aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements. However, there is a subtle issue that needs to be addressed:

- **Invalid Score Combinations**: The function does not explicitly check if the scores are achievable with a valid set of games. For example, the scores `1 1 1` are impossible because the total points (3) are odd, and the function correctly prints `-1`. However, the scores `3 3 3` are also impossible because the total points (9) are odd, and the function correctly prints `-1`. But for scores like `1 1 2`, the function prints `2`, which is incorrect because the total points (4) are even, but the maximum number of draws should be `1` (since the sum of the two lower scores is `2`).

To ensure correctness, we need to add an additional check to ensure that the scores are achievable with a valid set of games. Specifically, the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores should not exceed the number of games that could have been played.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        total_points = a + b + c
        max_draws = total_points // 2
        
        if c > max_draws:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        possible_draws = min(max_draws, a + b)
        
        if possible_draws > c - a:
            print(c - a)
        else:
            print(possible_draws)
```

However, the original function does not include this additional check, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**

The original function does not handle all edge cases correctly, specifically when the scores are not achievable with a valid set of games. The function should include additional checks to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
