### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Validity of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it is a draw). Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of points that could have been distributed if all games were draws.
   - The program then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned if all their games were draws.
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the result. This is because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the total number of points distributed (`x`) or the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

4. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by ensuring the sum of scores is even and then calculating the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The logic and calculations are sound and match the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
