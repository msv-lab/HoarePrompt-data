Reasoning:

The problem requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The provided function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

To understand why, consider the following:

1. **Subsequence Requirement**: A string `a` is a subsequence of another string `b` if `a` can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from `b` without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "ab" is a subsequence of "abc" and "acb", but not of "cba".

2. **All Possible Strings of Length `n`**: There are `k^n` possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc".

3. **Function Output**: The function `func_1` returns a string of length `k * n` by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function returns "abcabc".

4. **Subsequence Check**: The string "abcabc" does not contain all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences. For instance, "ca" is not a subsequence of "abcabc".

5. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would be to generate a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` are included. One such approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once. However, generating a de Bruijn sequence is more complex than the current function.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function `func_1` does not satisfy the requirement of the problem, as it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
