You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers from the input, which are expected to be in non-decreasing order. It then calculates a result based on these integers and prints either `-1` if the sum of the integers is odd, or a calculated value if the sum is even. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed in a win/loss or 2 points being distributed in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculate Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have earned without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all the games, and any additional points would have to come from draws.
     - Subtracting this value from the total points gives the number of points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 (since each draw results in 2 points) gives the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), which results in `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the total points are 0, and there are no draws, so the output is `0`.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the total points are 2, and the maximum number of draws is 1 (one game ended in a draw), so the output is `1`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the total points are 3, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total points are 4, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total points are 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 6 (six games ended in draws), so the output is `6`.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`.
