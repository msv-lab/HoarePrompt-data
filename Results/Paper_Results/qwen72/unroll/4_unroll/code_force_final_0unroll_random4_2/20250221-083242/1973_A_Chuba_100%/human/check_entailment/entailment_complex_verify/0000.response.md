Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` which represent the scores of the three players. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the total score of all three players is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw). This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - **Explanation of the Formula**:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the number of games played. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score is not achievable without invalid results.
     - The result is then divided by 2 to account for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - **Correctness of the Formula**:
     - The formula correctly handles the case where the scores are such that the highest score is achievable with the given rules.
     - However, the formula does not correctly handle the case where the scores are equal (e.g., `3 3 3`). In this case, the formula calculates the result as `(3 + 3 + 3 - max(0, 3 - 3 - 3)) // 2 = 9 // 2 = 4.5`, which is then truncated to `4`. This is incorrect because it is impossible to achieve equal scores of 3 for all players with 4 draws. The correct output should be `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If the scores are `0 0 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **Single Draw**: If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw is possible.
   - **Invalid Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Equal Scores**: If the scores are `3 3 3`, the program incorrectly prints `4` instead of `-1`. This is a critical error.
   - **Valid Draws**: If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - **Large Difference in Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the maximum number of draws is 2.

Given the error in handling the case where all scores are equal, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Final: **False**
