The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the initial state and should be mentioned. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0**
