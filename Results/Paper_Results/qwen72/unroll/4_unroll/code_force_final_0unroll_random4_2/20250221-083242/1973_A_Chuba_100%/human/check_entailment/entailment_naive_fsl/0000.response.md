Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the total score of all three players is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - This formula works as follows:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the number of games played. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score is not achievable without invalid results.
     - The result is then divided by 2 to account for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If the scores are `0 0 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **Single Draw**: If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw is possible.
   - **Invalid Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Equal Scores**: If the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Valid Draws**: If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - **Large Difference in Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the maximum number of draws is 2.

The program handles all these cases and more, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly or `-1` is printed when the scores are invalid. Therefore, the program is correct.
