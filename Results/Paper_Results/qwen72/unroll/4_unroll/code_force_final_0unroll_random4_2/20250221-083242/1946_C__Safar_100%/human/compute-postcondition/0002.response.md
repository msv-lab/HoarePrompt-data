Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and each list at index `b` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `b` by an edge. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.**
