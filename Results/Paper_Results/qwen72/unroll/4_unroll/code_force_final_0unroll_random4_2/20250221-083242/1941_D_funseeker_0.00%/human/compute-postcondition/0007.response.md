Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` set, after `m` iterations of the loop. If `0` is in the initial `ans` set, `0` is excluded, and `n` is included in the final `ans` set. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.***
