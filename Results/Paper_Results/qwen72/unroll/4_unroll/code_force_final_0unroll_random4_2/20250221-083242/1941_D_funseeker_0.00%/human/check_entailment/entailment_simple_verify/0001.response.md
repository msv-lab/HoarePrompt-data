### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()`, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It uses helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to parse the input. These functions are correctly implemented to handle different types of input lines. Specifically:
     - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips leading and trailing whitespace.
     - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
     - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over each throw and updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each throw, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic is correct because it accounts for both possible directions when `c` is '?'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is necessary because player `n` is represented as `0` in the modulo operation, and the output should be in the range `[1, n]`.
   - The check and replacement are correctly implemented.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the players' numbers in increasing order. This is done using `print(len(ans))` and `print(*ans)`, which is correct.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is efficient and correctly parses the input as described in the problem statement.
  - The use of `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and the helper functions ensures that the input is read and processed correctly.

- **Initialization:**
  - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`, which is correct.

- **Processing Throws:**
  - The loop iterates `m` times, correctly processing each throw.
  - The conditions for adding positions to the set `temp` are correct:
    - `(q + r) % n` for clockwise throws or unknown directions.
    - `(q - r) % n` for counterclockwise throws or unknown directions.
  - The use of a temporary set `temp` to collect all possible positions and then updating `ans` with `temp` ensures that the set `ans` always contains the current possible positions of the ball.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` by checking if `0` is in the set `ans` and replacing it with `n`.
  - This ensures that the output is always in the range `[1, n]`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the number of possible players and the players' numbers in increasing order.
  - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and meets all the problem requirements. It efficiently processes the input, correctly updates the possible positions of the ball, handles edge cases, and produces the correct output format.

Final: **True**
