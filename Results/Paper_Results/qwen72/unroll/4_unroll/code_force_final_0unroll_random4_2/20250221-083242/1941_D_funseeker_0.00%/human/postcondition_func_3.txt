The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the output of `func_3` to initialize `n`, `m`, and `x`. It computes a set `ans` that contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` after `m` iterations, where `r` and `c` are obtained from the output of `func_1`. If `0` is in the final set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the size of the set `ans` and all elements in the set. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.
