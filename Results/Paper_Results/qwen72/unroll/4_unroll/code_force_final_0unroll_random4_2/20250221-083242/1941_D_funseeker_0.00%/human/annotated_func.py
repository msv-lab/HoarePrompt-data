def func_1():

    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players in the game, m is an integer representing the number of throws made, x is an integer representing the starting player, and throws is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a string c_i ('0', '1', or '?') representing the distance and direction of each throw, respectively.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The specific value depends on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` implicitly uses parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws` but does not directly manipulate them. It calls another function `func_1` and returns the integer result of that call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. From the user's perspective, `func_2` returns an integer. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged with respect to the input parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any input parameters.
def func_3():

    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers by splitting the string returned from `func_1()` and converting each substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` set, after `m` iterations of the loop.

        ans.discard(0)

    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` set, after `m` iterations of the loop. If `0` is in the initial `ans` set, `0` is excluded, and `n` is included in the final `ans` set. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` set after `m` iterations, with `0` excluded and `n` included if `0` was initially in the set)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` and `r` in the initial set `ans` after `m` iterations, with `0` excluded if present, and `n` included if `0` was present
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the output of `func_3` to initialize `n`, `m`, and `x`. It computes a set `ans` that contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` after `m` iterations, where `r` and `c` are obtained from the output of `func_1`. If `0` is in the final set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the size of the set `ans` and all elements in the set. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.
