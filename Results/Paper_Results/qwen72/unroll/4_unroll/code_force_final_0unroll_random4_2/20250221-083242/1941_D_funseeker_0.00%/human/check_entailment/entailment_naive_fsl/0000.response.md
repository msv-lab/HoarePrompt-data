Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial player number `x` is `n`. According to the problem description, the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and the ball starts with player `x`. If `x` is `n`, the program should correctly handle this case, but the current implementation does not.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 1 5
2 0
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
2
```
However, the program will output:
```
1
1
```
This is because the program uses modulo `n` directly, which can result in a value of 0 when the ball is thrown from player `n`. The program should adjust the modulo operation to ensure that the player numbers are always in the range from 1 to `n`.
