### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function initializes `todo` as a set containing all elements of `b`.
   - It initializes `done` and `extra` as empty sets.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` to populate `done` and `extra` based on whether the elements are in `todo`.

3. **Counting Initial Good Subsegment:**
   - The function checks if the initial subsegment of length `m` is good by verifying if the size of `done` is at least `k`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial subsegment is good, otherwise 0.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the oldest element `a[r - m]` from the window.
     - It updates the sets `done` and `todo` based on the removal of `a[r - m]`.
     - It updates the sets `done` and `todo` based on the addition of `a[r]`.
     - It increments `ans` if the current subsegment is good (i.e., `len(done) >= k`).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `ans` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Set Operations:**
  - The use of sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` is not efficient for this problem. Sets do not keep track of the count of elements, which is necessary to handle duplicates in `b`.
  - For example, if `b` contains duplicates, removing an element from `todo` and adding it to `done` might not correctly reflect the number of matches.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - A more appropriate approach would be to use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the counts of elements in `b` and the current window in `a`.
  - This would allow for correct handling of duplicates and efficient counting.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the set operations and the need to handle duplicates correctly, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
