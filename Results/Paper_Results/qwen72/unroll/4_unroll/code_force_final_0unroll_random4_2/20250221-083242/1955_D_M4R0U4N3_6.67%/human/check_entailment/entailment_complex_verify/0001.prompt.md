You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of integers: a (length n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and b (length m, 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` where at least `k` elements from the list `b` are present. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset and reinitialized for each test case, so they do not retain their values between test cases. After the loop, the program has finished executing and there are no more test cases to process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` where at least `k` elements from the list `b` are present. The function prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset and reinitialized for each test case, so they do not retain their values between test cases. After processing all test cases, the program has finished executing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It also initializes two sets: `done` to keep track of elements that match `b` and `extra` to keep track of elements that do not match `b`.

3. **First Subsegment Check:**
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` to check how many of them match the elements in `todo`.
   - If an element matches, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
   - If an element does not match, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`. If so, it initializes `ans` to 1, otherwise to 0.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window, it updates the sets `done` and `extra`:
     - If the element being removed from the window (`a[r - m]`) was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If the element being removed was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - If the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved to `done`.
   - If the new element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`. If so, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly handles the transition from one subsegment to the next.
  - The sets `done` and `extra` are used to keep track of the elements that match and do not match the elements in `b`, respectively.
  - The program correctly updates these sets as the window slides over the array `a`.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `m == n` by correctly processing the entire array `a` in the first subsegment check.
  - It also handles the case where `k == m` by ensuring that all elements in the subsegment must match the elements in `b`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n \log m)\) due to the set operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the problem description. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
