The function should accept three parameters: n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of integers: a (length n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and b (length m, 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
