The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. The number of iterations is determined by the value read from the input, which is converted to an integer. For the loop to execute, the input value must be at least 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **The input value for the range must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
