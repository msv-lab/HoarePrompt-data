The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it processes and prints the results for `t` test cases. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the output for each case is the result of `func_2` applied to the sorted list `a` and the integers `k` and `x`.
