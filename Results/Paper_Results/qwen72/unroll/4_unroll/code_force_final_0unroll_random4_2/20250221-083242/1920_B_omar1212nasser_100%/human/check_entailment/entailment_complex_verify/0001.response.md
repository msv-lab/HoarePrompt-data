### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the most beneficial to remove to maximize the sum) and Bob to multiply the smallest elements by -1 (which are the most beneficial to minimize the sum).

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.

4. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob will try to minimize the sum by multiplying the smallest `x` elements by -1. The effect of this is to subtract twice the sum of these `x` elements from the total sum.
   - The initial sum after Bob's operation is stored in `pos[0]`.

5. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The program iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove, from 1 to `k`.
   - For each possible number of removals `i`, the program updates the sum `s` by subtracting the `i`-th smallest element (which is the `i`-th element from the end of the sorted array).
   - It also updates `s2` to reflect the sum of the smallest `x` elements after the removal of `i` elements.
   - The new sum after Alice's removal and Bob's multiplication is calculated and appended to the list `pos`.

6. **Optimal Result**:
   - The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum Alice can achieve after her removals and Bob's multiplications.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining which elements to remove and which to multiply by -1.
- **Bob's Multiplication**: The program correctly calculates the effect of Bob's multiplication by subtracting twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements.
- **Alice's Removals**: The program correctly iterates over the possible number of removals and updates the sum accordingly.
- **Combining Strategies**: The program combines both strategies by calculating the sum for each possible number of removals and selecting the maximum.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element and Alice can remove it, the sum will be 0, which is correctly handled.
- **All Elements Removed**: If Alice can remove all elements, the sum will be 0, which is also correctly handled.
- **No Removals**: If Alice does not remove any elements, the program correctly calculates the sum after Bob's operations.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Correctness of Initial Sum and Bob's Operation**:
  - The initial sum `s` is correctly calculated.
  - The initial sum after Bob's operation is correctly calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.

- **Correctness of Alice's Removals**:
  - The loop iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive).
  - For each removal, the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the `i`-th smallest element.
  - The sum `s2` is updated to reflect the sum of the smallest `x` elements after the removal of `i` elements.
  - The new sum after Alice's removal and Bob's multiplication is correctly calculated and appended to the list `pos`.

- **Combining Strategies**:
  - The program correctly combines both strategies by calculating the sum for each possible number of removals and selecting the maximum.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice and Bob's strategies and handles the edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
