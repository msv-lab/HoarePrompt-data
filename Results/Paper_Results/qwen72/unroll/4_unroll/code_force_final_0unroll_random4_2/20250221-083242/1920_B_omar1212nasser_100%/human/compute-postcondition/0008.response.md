Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that has `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` represents the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `i` elements (for `i` ranging from 0 to `removals`), adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the modified list. The function does not modify the input list `elements`. **
