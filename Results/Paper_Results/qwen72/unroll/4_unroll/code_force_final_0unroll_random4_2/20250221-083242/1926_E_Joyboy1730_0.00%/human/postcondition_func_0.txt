The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000`. The function calculates a value based on `n` and `k` and prints it if a certain condition is met. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the input variables `n` and `k` are not defined outside the loop. The list `L` is empty at the end of each iteration, and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each test case.
