You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and the number of cities `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the nearest neighboring city (either the previous or the next city in the `cities` list), with a special value of 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` to store the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to store the cumulative costs of traveling to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the respective indices.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the unique closest city condition.
   - The prefix sums are calculated efficiently, and the queries are processed in O(1) time using these prefix sums.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` has a logical error. It should only consider the distance to the next city if it exists, and the distance to the previous city if it exists.
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly sets `forward` to `999999999999999999` and `back` to `-99999999999999999999` for all cities, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The function should correctly handle the edge cases where `i` is 0 or `i` is `n-1`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the `func_1` function, which incorrectly calculates the cost of traveling to the closest city. Specifically, the conditions for setting `forward` and `back` should be more carefully handled to avoid incorrect results. The correct approach should be to only consider the next city if `i < n-1` and the previous city if `i > 0`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999 if i == 0 else cities[i - 1]
        forward = 999999999999999999 if i == n - 1 else cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly.
