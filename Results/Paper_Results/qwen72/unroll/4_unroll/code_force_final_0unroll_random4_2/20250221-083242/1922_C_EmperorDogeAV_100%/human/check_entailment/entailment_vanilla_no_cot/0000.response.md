Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost for the first and last cities.
   - For the first city, the closest city should be the second city, but the function sets `back` to `-99999999999999999999`, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons.
   - For the last city, the function should set `forward` to `999999999999999999`, but it incorrectly checks `i < n - 1` instead of `i < n - 2`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city. However, the program incorrectly calculates these prefix sums.
   - The prefix sum should be built based on the cost of traveling to the closest city, but the program incorrectly uses the `prog_cities` array, which contains incorrect values.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program assumes that the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1, which is not true for all cities. The cost should be the minimum distance to the closest city, which is not always 1.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Determine the closest city for each city.
- Calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
- Use prefix sums to efficiently answer the queries.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):
            closest_cities[i] = i + 1
        else:
            closest_cities[i] = i - 1
    closest_cities[0] = 1
    closest_cities[n - 1] = n - 2
    
    # Calculate the cost to travel to the closest city
    costs = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            costs[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i + 1])
        elif i == n - 1:
            costs[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
        else:
            costs[i] = min(abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]), abs(cities[i] - cities[i + 1]))
    
    # Calculate prefix sums for forward and backward travel
    pref_sum_f = [0] * n
    pref_sum_b = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        pref_sum_f[i] = pref_sum_f[i - 1] + costs[i - 1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        pref_sum_b[i] = pref_sum_b[i + 1] + costs[i + 1]
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1])
```

### Key Changes:
- **Closest City Calculation**: Correctly determine the closest city for each city.
- **Cost Calculation**: Correctly calculate the cost to travel to the closest city.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Correctly build the prefix sums for both forward and backward travel.

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly and efficiently.
