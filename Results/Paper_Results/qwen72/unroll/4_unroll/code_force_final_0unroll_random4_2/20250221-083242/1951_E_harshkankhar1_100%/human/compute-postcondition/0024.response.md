Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string that contains at least one character different from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character.
   - The values of `n` (length of `s`) and `s` remain unchanged.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `s` is a string with at least one character different from the first character.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, but we don't need to know the exact implementation of `func_1` to determine the output of the `print` statement.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is: `print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])`.
   - `s[:x + 2]` is a substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` is a substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, `s[:x + 2]` will include the first `x + 2` characters of `s`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` will include the characters from `x + 2` to the end of the string.

5. **Example**:
   - Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"`.
   - The first character different from `s[0]` is `b` at index `3`.
   - Therefore, `x = 3`.
   - `s[:x + 2]` will be `s[:5]`, which is `"aaabb"`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` will be `s[5:]`, which is `"bbccc"`.

6. **General Case**:
   - The exact value of `s` is not provided, but we know that `s[:x + 2]` will include the first `x + 2` characters of `s`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` will include the characters from `x + 2` to the end of the string.

Given the initial state and the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **[s[:x + 2]] ' ' [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of s from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of s starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)**
