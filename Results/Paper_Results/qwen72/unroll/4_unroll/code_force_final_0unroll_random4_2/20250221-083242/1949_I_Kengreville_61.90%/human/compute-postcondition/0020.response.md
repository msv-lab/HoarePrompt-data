The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is a constraint on an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 1000. Since `n` is not a parameter of the function, it is likely a local variable or a constant within the function. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It likely involves an integer `n` within the range 1 to 1000, but the specific return value is not provided.**
