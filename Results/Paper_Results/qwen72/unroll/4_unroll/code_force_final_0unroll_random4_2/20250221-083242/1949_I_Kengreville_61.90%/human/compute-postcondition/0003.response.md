The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be initialized to 0. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state (such as `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the purpose of ensuring the loop executes.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `visited[i]` is `True`, `i` has been appended to the list `nodes`**
