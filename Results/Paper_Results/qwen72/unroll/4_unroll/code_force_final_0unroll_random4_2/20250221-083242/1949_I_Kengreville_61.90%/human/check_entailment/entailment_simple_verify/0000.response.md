### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a set of disks with integer coordinates and integer radii.
   - The task is to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks.
   - For each connected component, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the requirements.
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent a linear equation that, if solvable, would allow the radii to be adjusted.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `n` is read from input.
     - Lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized.
     - `nodes` is an empty list used to store the indices of disks in the current connected component.
   - **DFS Function**:
     - The `dfs` function marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
     - It iterates through all other disks to find those that are tangent to the current disk.
     - For each tangent disk, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` and recursively calls `dfs` on the tangent disk.
   - **Main Function**:
     - The main function `func_1` initializes `ok` to `False`.
     - It iterates through all disks, and for each unvisited disk, it initializes `coef0` and `coef1` and calls `dfs`.
     - After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the connected component.
     - If `c1` (sum of `coef1` for the connected component) is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.
     - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other and the radii cannot be changed to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency.
   - The provided example input:
     ```
     3
     0 0 1
     2 0 1
     1 1 1
     ```
     - In this example, the three disks are tangent to each other, forming a triangle.
     - The program's logic is based on the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to determine if the radii can be adjusted.
     - The original assessment suggests that the program might output `YES` incorrectly for this case.

5. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - **DFS and Coefficients**:
     - The `dfs` function correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
     - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent a linear equation that, if solvable, would allow the radii to be adjusted.
     - The key condition is whether `c1` (sum of `coef1` for the connected component) is zero. If `c1` is zero, it means that the linear equation has no solution that strictly decreases the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency.
   - **Example Input**:
     - For the input:
       ```
       3
       0 0 1
       2 0 1
       1 1 1
       ```
       - The program will correctly identify the connected component of the three disks.
       - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` will be calculated for each disk.
       - The sum of `coef1` for the connected component will be zero, indicating that the radii cannot be adjusted to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.
       - Therefore, the program will output `NO`, which is the correct output for this case.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is sound and correctly handles the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other.
   - The original assessment was based on an incorrect assumption that the program might output `YES` for the given example input.
   - The program correctly identifies that the radii cannot be adjusted to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency in the provided example.
