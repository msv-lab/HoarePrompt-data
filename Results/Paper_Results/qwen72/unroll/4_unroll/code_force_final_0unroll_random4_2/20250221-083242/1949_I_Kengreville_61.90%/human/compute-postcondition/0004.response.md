Output State: **The loop will have iterated through all the disks (0 to n-1). For each disk `j` that is within the touching distance of disk `i` (i.e., the distance between the centers of disks `i` and `j` is exactly equal to the sum of their radii), the `visited[j]` will be set to `True`, `nodes` will include `j`, `coef0[j]` will be updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` will be updated to `-coef1[i]`. The `dfs(j)` function will be called for each such disk `j`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
