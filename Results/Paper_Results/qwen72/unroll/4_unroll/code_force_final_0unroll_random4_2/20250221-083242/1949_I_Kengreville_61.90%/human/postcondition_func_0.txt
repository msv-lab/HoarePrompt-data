The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 1000`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers. It initializes several lists of length `n` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the elements. After the search, it checks if there is at least one element in the `nodes` list for which the sum of `coef1` values is not zero. If such an element exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited` remain unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `1`, and `nodes` is an empty list.
