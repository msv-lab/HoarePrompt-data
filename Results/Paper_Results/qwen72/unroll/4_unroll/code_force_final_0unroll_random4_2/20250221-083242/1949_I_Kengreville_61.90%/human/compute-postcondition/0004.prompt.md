Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers, and their lengths are all equal to n. The elements of x and y represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of r represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The lists visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are used to track the state of the disks during the depth-first search (DFS) process, with visited indicating whether a disk has been visited, nodes storing the sequence of visited disks, and coef0 and coef1 used to store coefficients related to the radii adjustments. The current value of `visited[i]` is `True`, indicating that the disk at index `i` has been visited. The value of `i` has been appended to the list `nodes`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
