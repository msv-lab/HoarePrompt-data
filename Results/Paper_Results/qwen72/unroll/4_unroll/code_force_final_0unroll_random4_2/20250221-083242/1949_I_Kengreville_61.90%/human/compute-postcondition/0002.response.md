Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers, and their lengths are all equal to n. The elements of x and y represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of r represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The lists visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are used to track the state of the disks during the depth-first search (DFS) process, with visited indicating whether a disk has been visited, nodes storing the sequence of visited disks, and coef0 and coef1 used to store coefficients related to the radii adjustments. The current value of `visited[i]` is `True`, indicating that the disk at index `i` has been visited. The value of `i` has been appended to the list `nodes`.**
