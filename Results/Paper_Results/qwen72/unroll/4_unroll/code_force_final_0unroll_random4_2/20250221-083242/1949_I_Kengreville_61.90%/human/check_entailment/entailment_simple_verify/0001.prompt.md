You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It then reads the coordinates and radii for each disk and stores them in the respective arrays.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The problem can be thought of as a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and determine the coefficients for each disk.

3. **DFS and Coefficients:**
   - The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk. It marks the disk as visited and appends it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each disk, it checks all other disks to see if they are tangent. If they are, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the tangent disk and recursively calls `dfs` on it.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the linear relationship between the radii of the disks in a connected component. Specifically, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` represent the equation `r[j] = coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r[i]` where `r[i]` is the radius of the starting disk in the DFS.

4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - After performing the DFS for each connected component, the function calculates the sum of the coefficients `c0` and `c1` for the disks in that component.
   - If `c1` is non-zero for any component, it means that the radii can be adjusted in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. This is because a non-zero `c1` indicates that the radii are not all the same, and thus there is room to adjust them.

5. **Output:**
   - If any connected component has a non-zero `c1`, the function prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of DFS:**
  - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are part of the same connected component (i.e., disks that are tangent to each other directly or indirectly).
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are correctly updated to maintain the tangency relationship.

- **Sum of Radii Adjustment:**
  - The key insight is that if `c1` is non-zero for any connected component, it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
  - This is because a non-zero `c1` implies that the radii of the disks in the component are not all the same, and thus there is a way to decrease the sum by adjusting the radii.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no tangent disks by correctly setting `c1` to zero and printing `NO`.
  - It also handles the case where all disks are tangent to each other in a way that allows for a decrease in the sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The use of DFS to identify connected components and the calculation of coefficients to check for the possibility of decreasing the sum of radii are both sound.

Correctness: **True**
