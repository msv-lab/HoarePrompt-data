Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk. This is in line with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes several lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`). The `visited` list is used to track which disks have been processed, `coef0` and `coef1` are used to store coefficients for the radii adjustments, and `nodes` is used to store the sequence of visited disks during the DFS.

3. **DFS Logic**: The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk. It marks the disk as visited, appends its index to the `nodes` list, and then iterates through all other disks to find those that are tangent to the current disk. If a tangent disk is found, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on the tangent disk. This ensures that all disks in a connected component (a set of disks that are tangent to each other) are processed.

4. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the radii and positions of the disks. Specifically, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. This is intended to ensure that the sum of the radii of the disks in a connected component can be adjusted while maintaining tangency.

5. **Check for Feasibility**: After processing all disks, the function checks if there is at least one connected component where the sum of the `coef1` values is not zero. If such a component exists, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Output**: The output is correct based on the problem's requirements. If there is at least one connected component with a non-zero sum of `coef1` values, it means that the radii can be adjusted to strictly decrease the total sum while maintaining tangency. If all components have a zero sum of `coef1` values, it means that no such adjustment is possible.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

- **DFS Initialization**: The `dfs` function is called without passing the `n` variable, which is used within the function. This should be fixed by passing `n` as an argument to `dfs`.

- **Coefficient Logic**: The logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` seems to be based on the idea that the sum of the radii can be adjusted by a linear combination. However, the specific update rules (`coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`) need to be carefully validated to ensure they correctly handle the problem constraints.

- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when there are no tangent disks or when all disks are already at their minimum possible radii.

Given the above reasoning and the provided comments, the program seems to be on the right track, but the specific update rules for `coef0` and `coef1` need to be validated to ensure they meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The program is not fully correct due to the potential issues with the DFS initialization and the coefficient update logic. These need to be addressed to ensure the program meets the problem's requirements.
