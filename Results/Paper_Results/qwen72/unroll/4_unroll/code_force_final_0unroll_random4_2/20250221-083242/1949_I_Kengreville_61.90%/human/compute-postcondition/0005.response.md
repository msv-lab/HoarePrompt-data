Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n. The lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` have lengths equal to `n`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, the loop will have iterated through all the disks (0 to n-1). For each disk `j` within the touching distance of disk `i` (i.e., the distance between the centers of disks `i` and `j` is exactly equal to the sum of their radii), `visited[j]` will be set to `True`, `nodes` will include `j`, `coef0[j]` will be updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` will be updated to `-coef1[i]`. The `dfs(j)` function will be called for each such disk `j`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to any of the lists.***
