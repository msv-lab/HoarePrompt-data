The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, which is the starting point of the loop. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state before the loop are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
