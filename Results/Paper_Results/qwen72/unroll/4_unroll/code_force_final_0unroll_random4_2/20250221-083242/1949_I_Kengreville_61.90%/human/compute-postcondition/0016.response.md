Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `True` because there is at least one element in `nodes` for which `c1` is not `0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The value of `ok` is `True`, but this does not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on the value of `ok`.
- The `nodes` list is empty, but this also does not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on the contents of `nodes`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects.

Output: **YES**
