### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The centers of the disks cannot be changed, and the new radii can be any positive real numbers.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of disks `n` and their coordinates and radii.
     - The input is correctly parsed and stored in lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.

   - **Initialization:**
     - `visited` is a list to keep track of which disks have been visited during the DFS.
     - `coef0` and `coef1` are lists to store coefficients for the radii adjustments.
     - `nodes` is a list to store the sequence of disks visited in a connected component.

   - **DFS Function (`dfs`):**
     - The DFS function is used to explore connected components of tangent disks.
     - For each disk `i` that is not visited, it marks `i` as visited and adds it to `nodes`.
     - It then iterates over all other disks `j` to check if they are tangent to `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is exactly the sum of their radii).
     - If `j` is tangent to `i` and not visited, it updates the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` and recursively calls `dfs(j)`.

   - **Main Logic in `func_1`:**
     - The program iterates over all disks and performs a DFS for each unvisited disk.
     - It calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the current connected component.
     - If `c1` (sum of `coef1` for the current component) is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.
     - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` (indicating at least one connected component can be adjusted to reduce the total radius), otherwise it prints `NO`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Handling Tangency:**
     - The program correctly identifies tangent disks by checking if the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.
   - **DFS and Connected Components:**
     - The DFS function correctly explores all disks in a connected component of tangent disks.
     - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the adjustments needed for each disk in the component.
   - **Sum of Radii Reduction:**
     - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero. This is a valid approach because if `c1` is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii of the disks in that component to reduce the total radius while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.
   - **Output:**
     - The output is `YES` if at least one connected component can be adjusted to reduce the total radius, and `NO` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks and checks if the radii can be adjusted to reduce the total radius while maintaining the conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
