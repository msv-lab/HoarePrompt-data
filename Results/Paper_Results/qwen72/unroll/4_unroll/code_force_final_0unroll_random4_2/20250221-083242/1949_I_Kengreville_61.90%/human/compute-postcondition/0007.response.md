Functionality: ** The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a set of disks. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, appends the indices of visited disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radii and positions of touching disks. The function does not return any value explicitly. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will indicate which disks have been visited, the `nodes` list will contain the indices of all visited disks in the order they were visited, and the `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated with coefficients related to the radii adjustments of the touching disks. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged. **
