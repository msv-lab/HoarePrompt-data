Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the maximum of the current score and the score if the player stays at the same position, which does not align with the problem description. The correct approach should be to simply add the score at the current position to the total score for each turn, without considering the maximum.

Here is a corrected version of the logic for updating the scores:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for j in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

In the original program, the scores `bm` and `sm` are updated using the following logic:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

This logic is incorrect because it does not follow the rules of the game, which state that the score should be updated by adding the value at the current position in the array `a` for each turn. The corrected version simply adds the value at the current position to the total score for each turn, which is the correct approach.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

For this test case, the correct output should be:

```
Bodya
```

However, the original program will produce an incorrect result due to the flawed score update logic.
