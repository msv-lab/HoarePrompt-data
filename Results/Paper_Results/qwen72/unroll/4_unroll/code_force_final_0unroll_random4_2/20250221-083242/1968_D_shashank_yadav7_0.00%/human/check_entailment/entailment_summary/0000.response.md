Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simulating the game for each test case. However, there are a few issues with the logic that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The scores should be incremented by `a[x]` for the current position `x` and then the player can either stay or move to `p[x]`. The program, however, uses a complex and incorrect method to update the scores, which involves multiplying and adding in a way that does not reflect the game rules.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop that simulates the game turns is flawed. The variable `k` is decremented inside the loop, but the loop should run exactly `k` times, not until `k` becomes zero. Additionally, the way the scores are updated inside the loop does not follow the game rules correctly.

3. **Incorrect Use of `max` Function**: The use of the `max` function inside the loop to update `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The `max` function is not needed here because the scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in `a`.

4. **Incorrect Position Updates**: The positions `b` and `s` are updated by `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because the positions in the permutation `p` are 1-indexed, but the program is treating them as 0-indexed. This should be `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` to convert the 1-indexed positions to 0-indexed positions, but this should be done consistently throughout the loop.

5. **Incorrect Final Score Comparison**: The final score comparison should be based on the actual scores accumulated during the game, not on the incorrectly calculated `bm` and `sm`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
