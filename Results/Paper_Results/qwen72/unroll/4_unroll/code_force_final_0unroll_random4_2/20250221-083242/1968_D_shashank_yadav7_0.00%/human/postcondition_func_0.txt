The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates two values, `bm` and `sm`, based on the elements of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. After processing, it compares `bm` and `sm` and prints 'Bodya' if `bm` is greater, 'Sasha' if `sm` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal. The function does not return any values but prints the result for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes, leaving the input parameters unchanged.
