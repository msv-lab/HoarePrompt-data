The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through standard input. For each pair, it prints a value based on the conditions: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2 * n, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2; otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.
