Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The elements at even indices in the list `a` are reversed.

### Explanation:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - The list `a` is initially constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed. This means the elements at these indices are swapped with the elements at the corresponding even indices from the end of the list.

2. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices**:
   - For an even index `i`, the element at `a[i]` will be swapped with the element at `a[n-1-i]`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The even indices are 0 and 2.
   - After reversing, the list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n = 5`, the list `a` after reversing elements at even indices will be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- If `n = 6`, the list `a` after reversing elements at even indices will be `[6, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1]`.

### General Output:
- For any integer `n` between 3 and 10^5, the list `a` will be constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- The elements at even indices will be reversed, resulting in a list where the elements at even indices are swapped with the elements at the corresponding even indices from the end of the list.

### Final Output:
Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1] (where the elements at even indices are reversed and the elements at odd indices remain in their original order)**
