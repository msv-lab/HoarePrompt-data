You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `q` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9) from the user input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and any other variables outside the function remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates `q` times to process each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Digit Comparison**:
   - For a "STAIR", the condition `a < b < c` must be satisfied. The program checks this condition and prints "STAIR" if it is true.
   - For a "PEAK", the condition `a < b > c` must be satisfied. The program checks this condition and prints "PEAK" if it is true.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the program prints "NONE".

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program uses two separate `if` statements to check for "STAIR" and "PEAK" conditions. However, this can lead to incorrect output if both conditions are true (which is not possible with the given constraints, but it's a logical flaw).
   - The `else` statement is only associated with the second `if` statement, which means if `a < b > c` is false, it will print "NONE" regardless of whether `a < b < c` was true or not.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).
   - The program does not handle the case where both conditions are true, but this is not possible with the given constraints (a, b, c are digits and cannot simultaneously satisfy both `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a minor logical flaw. However, since the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` cannot be true simultaneously for any valid input, the program will still produce the correct output for all valid test cases.

Correctness: **True**
