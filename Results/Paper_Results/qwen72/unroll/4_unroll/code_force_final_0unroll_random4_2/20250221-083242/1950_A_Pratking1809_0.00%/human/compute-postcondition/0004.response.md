The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The function also accepts the number of test cases, `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It returns the result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
