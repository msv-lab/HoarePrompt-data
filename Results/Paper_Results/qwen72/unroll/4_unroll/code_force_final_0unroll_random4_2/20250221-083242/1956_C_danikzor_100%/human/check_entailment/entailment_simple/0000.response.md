### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the problem.
   - It also correctly outputs `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is the maximum allowed.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation using the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

4. **Effect of Operations**:
   - The permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` ensures that each row and each column is filled with the highest possible values.
   - Since each row and each column is filled with the same permutation, the matrix will be filled with the values `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` in each row and each column, maximizing the sum.

5. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the problem. This formula calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

6. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it correctly reads the input `n` within the function. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by maximizing the sum of the matrix and ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed `2 * n`. The formula used for the maximum sum is correct, and the operations are performed as required.

Correctness: **True**
