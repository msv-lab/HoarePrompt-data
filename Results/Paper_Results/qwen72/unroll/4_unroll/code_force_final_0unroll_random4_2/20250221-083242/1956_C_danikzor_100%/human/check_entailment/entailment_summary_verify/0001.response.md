### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
   - It then performs `2 * n` operations:
     - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
     - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation using the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

3. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares. However, the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix when each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is actually `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * n // 2` is derived from the fact that each row and each column will be filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns. Therefore, the sum of each row is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and since there are `n` rows, the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2) = n * (n + 1) * n // 2`.

4. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each Type 1 operation fills a row with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Each Type 2 operation fills a column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Since the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is used for both rows and columns, the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Output:**
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.
   - The maximum sum is printed first, followed by the number of operations.
   - Each operation is printed with the correct type, index, and permutation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is an error in the formula used to calculate the maximum sum. The correct formula should be `n * (n + 1) * n // 2` instead of `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This error affects the correctness of the program.

Final: **False**
