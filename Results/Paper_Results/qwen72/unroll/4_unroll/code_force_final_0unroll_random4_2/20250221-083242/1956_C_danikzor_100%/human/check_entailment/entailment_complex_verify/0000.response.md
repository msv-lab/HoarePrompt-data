Reasoning:

1. **Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used in the program, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each element in the matrix can be any number from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations to Achieve Maximum Sum**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, where each operation sets either a row or a column to the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1. This is a valid approach to achieve the maximum sum. By setting each row and each column to the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1, every element in the matrix will be a number from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the matrix will be maximized.
   - The operations are not redundant. They ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1, which is a valid and effective way to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - Despite the incorrect formula for the maximum sum, the operations performed by the program are correct and will indeed maximize the sum of the matrix. The program prints the operations in a format that matches the problem requirements.
   - The program's approach of printing \( 2n \) operations is within the allowed limit and will always achieve the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying the incorrect formula for the maximum sum. However, the operations performed by the program are valid and will achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect in terms of the formula but correct in terms of the operations and the overall solution.

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum, even though the operations it performs are valid and will achieve the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \).
