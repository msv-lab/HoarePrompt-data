The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **The number of test cases `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, the side length `l` is the last input value read for the last test case, the value of `s` is calculated and printed for each test case, the initial state of the test cases and their coordinates remains unchanged**
