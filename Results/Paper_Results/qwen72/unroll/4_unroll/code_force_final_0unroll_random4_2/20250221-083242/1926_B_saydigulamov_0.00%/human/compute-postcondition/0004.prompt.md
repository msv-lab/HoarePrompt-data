You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input to form a grid. If the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's and the number of '1's in the first two rows of the shape is the same, it prints the list `k` containing the count of '1's in each row of the shape. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the loop finishes. The variable `k` is reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function handles multiple test cases, each with a grid of '0's and '1's, and returns "triangle" or "square" based on the shape formed by the '1's in the grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
