Output State: **The loop iterates `a` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input to form a grid. If the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's and the number of '1's in the first two rows of the shape is the same, it prints the list `k` containing the count of '1's in each row of the shape. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the loop finishes. The variable `k` is reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.**
