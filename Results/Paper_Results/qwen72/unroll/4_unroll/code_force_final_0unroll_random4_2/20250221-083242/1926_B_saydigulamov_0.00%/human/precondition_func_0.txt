The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
