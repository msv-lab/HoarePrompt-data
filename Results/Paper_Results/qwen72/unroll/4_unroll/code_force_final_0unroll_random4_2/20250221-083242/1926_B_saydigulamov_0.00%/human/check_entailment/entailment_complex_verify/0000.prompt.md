You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input to form a grid. If the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's and the number of '1's in the first two rows of the shape is the same, it prints the list `k` containing the count of '1's in each row of the shape. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the loop finishes. The variable `k` is reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and then `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, it prints the list `k` containing these counts. The function does not return any value; it only prints the list `k` for qualifying test cases. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
3
000
011
011
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SQUARE
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[2, 2]
[1, 3]
```

The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE". Additionally, the logic for determining the shape is incorrect. The program checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, but this is not sufficient to determine the shape. For example, in the second test case, the first two rows have 0 '1's, which does not help in determining the shape. The program needs to check the entire grid to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square.
