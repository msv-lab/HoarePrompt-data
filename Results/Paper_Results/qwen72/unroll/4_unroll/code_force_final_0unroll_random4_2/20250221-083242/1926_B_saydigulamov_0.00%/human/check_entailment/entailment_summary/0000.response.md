Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the grid for each test case, and then it counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, it only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same and prints the list `k` if they are. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Output Requirement**: The problem requires the output to be either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case, but the program prints the list `k` instead.
2. **Shape Identification**: The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the pattern of '1's. It only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases properly. It should output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case, but it does not.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Check if the grid forms a square by verifying that all rows have the same number of '1's.
- Check if the grid forms a triangle by verifying that the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern of a triangle (i.e., the number of '1's in the i-th row is 2*i-1 for a normal triangle or 2*(k-i+1)-1 for an upside-down triangle).

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
