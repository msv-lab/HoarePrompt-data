You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and then `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, it prints the list `k` containing these counts. The function does not return any value; it only prints the list `k` for qualifying test cases. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function collects the count of '1's in each row where '1' is present into a list `k`.
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is used to determine if the shape is a square. This condition checks if the first and second rows have the same number of '1's.

3. **Output**:
   - If the first and second rows have the same number of '1's, the function prints the list `k`.

**Issues**:
- The function does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
- The function only checks the first two rows to determine the shape, which is insufficient. For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, and for a triangle, the number of '1's should form a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...).

**Correct Implementation**:
- The function should check if all rows have the same number of '1's to determine if the shape is a square.
- For a triangle, the function should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (either increasing or decreasing).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Collect the count of '1's in each row
        k = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        
        # Check if the shape is a square
        if len(set(k)) == 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check if the shape is a triangle
            is_triangle = True
            for i in range(len(k) - 1):
                if abs(k[i] - k[i + 1]) != 2:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # This should be "TRIANGLE" if not a square

```

**Explanation**:
- **Square Check**: The `set(k)` will contain only one unique value if all rows have the same number of '1's, indicating a square.
- **Triangle Check**: The function checks if the difference between the count of '1's in consecutive rows is exactly 2, which is the pattern for a triangle (either increasing or decreasing).

**Conclusion**:
The given program is incorrect because it does not print the required output and does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
