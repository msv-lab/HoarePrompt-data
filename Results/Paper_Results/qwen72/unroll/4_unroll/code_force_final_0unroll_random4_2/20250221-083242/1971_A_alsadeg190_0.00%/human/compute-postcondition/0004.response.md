Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). For each test case, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The number of test cases is determined by the initial input `x`, which must be a positive integer (1 <= x <= 100). After processing all test cases, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last input values received during the loop execution, and the function does not return any value. **
