You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is supposed to take two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(x, y):`.

    #State: The `result` list will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration, based on the input values of `x` and `y`. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, and each element in the list will be an integer representing the total number of screens required for the corresponding `x` and `y` values. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated for each iteration but are not retained after the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is an integer representing the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is less than the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but still requires an additional screen due to the layout constraints of the 5x3 grid. Specifically, the program calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and then checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space. However, it does not account for the fact that the remaining space might be fragmented in such a way that not all 1x1 icons can fit, even if the total number of remaining cells is sufficient.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
14 1
```
The program will calculate:
- `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen)
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11` (11 cells remain after placing the 2x2 icon)
- `space_x = 14` (14 1x1 icons)

Since `space_x <= remaining_cells` is `14 <= 11`, the program will incorrectly determine that only 1 screen is needed. However, the 14 1x1 icons cannot all fit into the remaining 11 cells because the 2x2 icon will occupy a 2x2 block, leaving the remaining cells in a fragmented layout that cannot accommodate all 14 1x1 icons in a single screen. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2 screens, but the program outputs 1.
