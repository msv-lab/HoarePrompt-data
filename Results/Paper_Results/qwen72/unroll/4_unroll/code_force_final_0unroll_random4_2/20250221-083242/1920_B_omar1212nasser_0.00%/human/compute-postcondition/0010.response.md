The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The constraints are that `0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements)`, and `1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5`, with each element in the list satisfying `1 <= elements[i] <= 1000`.

The function returns:
- **Case_1:** 0, if the conditions for `removals` and `negatives` are not met or if the list `elements` is empty.
- **Case_2:** The maximum value from the list `pos`, which is constructed by starting with the value `s - 2 * n` and then adding `removals` new values, each being the result of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` (if `removals` > `negatives`, `n` will be 0).

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if the conditions for `removals` and `negatives` are not met or if the list `elements` is empty. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains the initial value of `s - 2 * n` and `removals` new values, each being the result of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop.**
