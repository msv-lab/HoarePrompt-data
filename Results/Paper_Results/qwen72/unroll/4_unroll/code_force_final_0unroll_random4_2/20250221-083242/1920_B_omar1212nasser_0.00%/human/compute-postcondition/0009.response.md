Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the initial value of `s - 2 * n` followed by `removals` new values, where each new value is the result of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` (if `removals` > `negatives`, `n` will be 0).**
