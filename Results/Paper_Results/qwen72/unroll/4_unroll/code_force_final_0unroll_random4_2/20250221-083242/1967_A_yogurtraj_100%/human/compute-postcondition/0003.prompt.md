You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        r = a[0]
        
        rem = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the final value calculated based on the conditions in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but their values are reset at the start of each new test case. After all iterations, the final state of `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are undefined for the next test case (if any). The loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
