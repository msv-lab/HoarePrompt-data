Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `k` and `x` are integers where 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
