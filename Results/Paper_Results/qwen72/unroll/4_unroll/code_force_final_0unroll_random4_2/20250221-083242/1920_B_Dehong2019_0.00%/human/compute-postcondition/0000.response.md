The provided code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable statements that modify the state of the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
