### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game is a variation of the Nim game where players remove the same number of stones from all non-empty piles.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

3. **Set of Distinct Pile Sizes:**
   - The program creates a set `s` to store the distinct pile sizes from the input array `arr`.
   - This is a correct approach because the set will automatically remove any duplicate pile sizes.

4. **Sorting and Preprocessing:**
   - The set `s` is converted to a list and sorted.
   - A zero is prepended to the list `s` to handle edge cases where the smallest pile size is greater than 1.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the number of distinct pile sizes `n` is 2. If it is, Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
   - If `n` is greater than 2, the program iterates through the sorted list `s` to check the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between any two consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and the program determines the winner based on the value of `ans`.
   - The variable `ans` is toggled using the XOR operation (`ans ^= 1`) for each pair of consecutive pile sizes that differ by exactly 1.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice" if `ans` is 1, and "Bob" if `ans` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
- If there are only two distinct pile sizes, Alice can always win by removing the smaller pile size.
- If there are more than two distinct pile sizes, the program checks if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1. If they are, the game is essentially a Nim game with all piles of the same size, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of piles.
- The XOR operation is used to toggle the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes, which is a correct approach for determining the winner in a Nim-like game.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
