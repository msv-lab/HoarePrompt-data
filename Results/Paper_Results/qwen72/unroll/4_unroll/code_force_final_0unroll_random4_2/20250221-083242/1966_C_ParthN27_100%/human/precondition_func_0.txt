The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer in the inner lists (a_i) is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
