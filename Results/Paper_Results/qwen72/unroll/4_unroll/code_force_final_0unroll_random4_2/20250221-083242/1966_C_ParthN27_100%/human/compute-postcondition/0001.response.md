Output State: **The loop will iterate through each test case, and for each test case, it will determine whether Alice or Bob wins based on the conditions provided in the loop. After all iterations, the output state will be the results of the test cases printed as 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. The variables `t` and the list of lists will remain unchanged, while the variables `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` will have their values modified during each iteration of the loop but will be reset for the next test case.**
