Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \cdot n = n^3 \), because each element in the matrix can be set to a value between 1 and \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements in the matrix. The program's sum calculation is not correctly computing this value.

2. **Operations**: The operations are not correctly maximizing the sum of the matrix. The program is performing operations that set each row and each column to the same permutation, but it does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

3. **Output Format**: The output format for the operations is correct, but the operations themselves are not optimal for maximizing the sum.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Calculate the maximum sum as \( n^3 \).
- Perform operations that ensure each element in the matrix is set to the maximum value possible, which is \( n \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n  # Maximum possible sum
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)  # Output the maximum sum and the number of operations
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, *range(1, n + 1))  # Set each row to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))  # Set each column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, and the sum is correctly calculated as \( n^3 \). The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
