### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the sum calculation formula is incorrect. The formula used in the program:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
     This formula is derived from the difference of squares, but it does not correctly represent the sum of the matrix after applying the operations. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max(i, j)
     \]
     For \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum is 7, but the program calculates it as 9.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program are:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + 1):
         print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
         print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     These operations are not optimal for maximizing the sum. For \( n = 2 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     9 4
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     ```
     This results in a matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     The sum of this matrix is 6, not 7. The correct operations to achieve the maximum sum of 7 should be:
     ```
     7 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
     This results in a matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     2 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     The sum of this matrix is 7, which is the maximum possible sum.

3. **General Case**:
   - For a general \( n \times n \) matrix, the correct operations to maximize the sum would involve filling each row and column with the maximum possible values in a way that ensures the sum is maximized. The program's approach of using the same permutation for both rows and columns does not achieve this.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations it performs do not achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
