### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - The game ends when the sequence is empty.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - The relevant pairs are:
     - 1 XOR 1 = 0
     - 2 XOR 2 = 0
     - 3 XOR 3 = 0
     - 4 XOR 4 = 0

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) as much as possible.
   - If the count of any number is odd, Eve can remove one of that number to make it even, which will help Bob win.
   - If the count of all numbers is even, Bob wins. If the count of all numbers is odd, Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even using integer division by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3. If it is, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that one more number can be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.
   - The program does not consider the count of 4s in the additional check, but since 4 XOR 4 = 0, it does not affect the result.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even.
   - The additional check for the sum of remainders being 3 is correct because it ensures that if there are three odd counts, one more number can be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where all four counts (a, b, c, d) are odd, but this is implicitly covered by the sum of remainders check. If all four counts are odd, the sum of the remainders of the first three (a, b, c) will be 3, and the program will add 1 to the result, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Final: **True**
