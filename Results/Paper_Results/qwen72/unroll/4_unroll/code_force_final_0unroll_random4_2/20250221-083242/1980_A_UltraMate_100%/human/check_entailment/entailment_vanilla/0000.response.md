### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'` to check for each difficulty level.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is not in the `Counter` dictionary `hmp`, it means there are no problems of that difficulty level in the bank. Therefore, `m` problems of that difficulty level need to be created, and `ans` is incremented by `m`.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is in the `Counter` dictionary but the count is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that difficulty level. The program calculates the difference `m - hmp[i]` and adds it to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all difficulty levels, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `Counter` of `s` is `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 2}`
  - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`, `G` (but `G` is already present)
  - Additional problems needed: `1` for `A` and `1` for `F` (total `2`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `Counter` of `s` is `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 2}`
  - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`, `G` (but `G` is already present)
  - Additional problems needed: `2` for `A`, `2` for `F`, and `1` for `G` (total `5`)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
  - `Counter` of `s` is `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
  - Missing difficulties: `A`
  - Additional problems needed: `1` for `A` (total `1`)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description. The logic and implementation are sound and match the requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
