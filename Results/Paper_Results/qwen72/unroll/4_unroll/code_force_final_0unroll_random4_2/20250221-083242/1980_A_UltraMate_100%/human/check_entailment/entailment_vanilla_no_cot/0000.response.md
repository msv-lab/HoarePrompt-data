Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of rounds to be held). It then reads the string `s` which contains the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'` to check each difficulty level.
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`, if `i` is not in the counter `hmp`, it means Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level, so `ans` is incremented by `m`.
   - If `i` is in `hmp` but the count is less than `m`, it means Vlad needs `m - hmp[i]` more problems of that difficulty level, so `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.

4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
