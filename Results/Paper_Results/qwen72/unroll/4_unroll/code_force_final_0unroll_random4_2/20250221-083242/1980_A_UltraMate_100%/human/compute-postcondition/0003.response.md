The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `m`, and a string `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a string `a` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It returns a result based on these inputs.**
