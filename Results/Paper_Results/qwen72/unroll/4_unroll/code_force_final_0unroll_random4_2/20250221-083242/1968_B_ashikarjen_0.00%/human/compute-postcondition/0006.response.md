Output State: **The value of `k` will be the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, and `j` will be the index in `b` where the loop stopped looking for matches (either because it reached the end of `b` or because it found all matches). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
