The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two binary strings `a` and `b`. The lengths of `a` and `b` are within specified ranges, and each binary string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all `a` and `b` strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the binary strings `a` and `b` are provided, the function returns a value based on the comparison or operation performed on these strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two binary strings `a` and `b`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the operation or comparison performed on the binary strings `a` and `b`.**
