### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the lengths of the two binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in string `a` using a loop indexed by `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it searches for a matching character in string `b` starting from the current position `j`.

4. **Finding Matches:**
   - The inner `while` loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches `a[i]` or until `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), `k` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If no match is found and `j` reaches the end of `b`, the loop breaks, as it means the current prefix of `a` cannot be extended further as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop completes, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem by iterating through `a` and checking if each character can be found in `b` in the correct order.
- The use of the `while` loop ensures that the function only increments `k` when a valid match is found, and it stops the search as soon as a character in `a` cannot be matched in `b`.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `b` does not contain any '1' (as in the sixth example).
