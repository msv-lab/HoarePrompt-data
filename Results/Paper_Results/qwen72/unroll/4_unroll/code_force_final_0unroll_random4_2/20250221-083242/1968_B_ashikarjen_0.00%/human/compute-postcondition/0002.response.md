Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains two binary strings `a` and `b`, and the lengths of `a` and `b` are within the specified ranges. Each binary string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all `a` and `b` strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` and `m` are input integers. `a` is an input string. `b` is an input string.**
