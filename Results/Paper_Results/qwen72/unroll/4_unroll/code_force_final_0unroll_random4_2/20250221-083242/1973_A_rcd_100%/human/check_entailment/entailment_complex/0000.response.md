Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The function correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a series of chess games (where each game results in either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw) must always be even.

2. **Case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`**: The function correctly handles the case where the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1` and `p2`. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`, because all games could have been draws, and the third player could have had all their points from draws as well.

3. **Finding the Maximum Draws**: The function attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. The idea is to find a distribution of draws and wins/losses that satisfies the given scores. However, the logic here is flawed:
   - The loop initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`.
   - It then checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `p3`.

   The problem with this logic is that it doesn't correctly account for the distribution of draws and wins/losses. Specifically, the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` does not necessarily ensure that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that matches the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly find the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the total number of points can be distributed in a way that matches the given scores. The correct approach involves:
   - Calculating the total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - Ensuring that the distribution of wins and draws can result in the given scores. This involves checking if the difference in points can be explained by the number of wins and draws.

Given the flawed logic in the third step, the function does not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
