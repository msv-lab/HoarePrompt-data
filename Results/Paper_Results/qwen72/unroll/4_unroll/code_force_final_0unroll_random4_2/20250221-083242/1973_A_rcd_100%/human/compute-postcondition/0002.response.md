Output State: **The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the results of the calculations for each test case. For each test case, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the loop finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such pair is found, `p3` is printed.**
