Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, where `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`. The function then processes these values and prints a result for each test case. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such pair is found, it prints `p3`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
