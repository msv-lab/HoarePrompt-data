Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of string \( a \) form a subsequence of string \( b \). The program iterates through both strings using two pointers, \( i \) and \( j \), where \( i \) points to the current character in \( a \) and \( j \) points to the current character in \( b \). The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character \( a[i] \) in the substring \( b[j:] \).

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading the lengths \( n \) and \( m \) of strings \( a \) and \( b \), followed by the strings themselves.
2. **Pointer Initialization**: The pointers \( i \) and \( j \) are initialized to 0, and a counter \( c \) is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
3. **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as \( j \) is less than \( m \) and \( i \) is less than \( n \). Inside the loop:
   - `func_1` is called to find the position in \( b \) where the character \( a[i] \) first occurs starting from index \( j \).
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), \( j \) is updated to this index plus one, \( i \) is incremented, and the counter \( c \) is incremented.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, the loop breaks because the current character \( a[i] \) is not found in the remaining part of \( b \).
4. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the value of \( c \), which represents the maximum length \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of \( a \) form a subsequence of \( b \).
5. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of \( a[i] \) in the substring \( b[j:] \) and returns it. If the character is not found, it returns -1.

The program's logic and implementation align with the problem description and constraints. It correctly handles the cases where the prefix of \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \) and where it is not. The execution summary confirms that `func_1` works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
