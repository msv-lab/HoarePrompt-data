### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (count of matching characters).

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the strings `a` and `b` until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1` to find the position in `b` where the character `a[i]` first occurs in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (to move past the found character in `b`), increments `i` (to move to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (to count the match).
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it breaks the loop, indicating that the current character in `a` is not found in the remaining part of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the position of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` using the `find` method.
   - If the character is found, it returns the position relative to the original string `b` by adding `j` to the index.
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. The function `func_1` and the main loop work as intended, and the program handles all the given constraints and edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
