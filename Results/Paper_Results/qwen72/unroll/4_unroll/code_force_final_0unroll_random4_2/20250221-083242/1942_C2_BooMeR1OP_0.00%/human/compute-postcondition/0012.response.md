The only objects in the loop head are the variable `gap` and the list `gaps`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. If the `gaps` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `gap` will be the first element in `gaps` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `y` remains the same, `chosen_vertices` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `present` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `gaps` is now a sorted list of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list with the last element wrapping around to the first element plus `n`), `gaps` must have at least 1 element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`**
