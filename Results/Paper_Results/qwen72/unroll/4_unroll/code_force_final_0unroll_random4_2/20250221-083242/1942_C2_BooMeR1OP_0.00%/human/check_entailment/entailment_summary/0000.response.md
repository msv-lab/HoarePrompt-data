### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are adjusted by subtracting 1 from each to make them zero-indexed.
   - The vertices are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - A set `present` is created to keep track of the vertices that are already chosen.

3. **Initial Triangles Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

4. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list `a`. These gaps represent the number of vertices that can be added between the chosen vertices to form additional triangles.
   - The gaps are stored in a list `gaps` and sorted in ascending order.

5. **Additional Triangles Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to add as many vertices as possible to form additional triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If the number of pairs is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If the number of pairs is greater than `y`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop, as no more vertices can be added.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Setup:** The program correctly adjusts the vertices to be zero-indexed and sorts them, which is necessary for calculating gaps.
- **Initial Triangles Calculation:** The initial number of triangles `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form at least `x - 2` triangles.
- **Gap Calculation:** The gaps are correctly calculated and sorted, which helps in efficiently adding the maximum number of vertices to form additional triangles.
- **Additional Triangles Calculation:** The logic for adding vertices to form additional triangles is correct. It ensures that the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles is formed by adding vertices in the smallest gaps first, which is a greedy approach that works well for this problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the execution summary confirms that it processes the inputs and calculates the output as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
