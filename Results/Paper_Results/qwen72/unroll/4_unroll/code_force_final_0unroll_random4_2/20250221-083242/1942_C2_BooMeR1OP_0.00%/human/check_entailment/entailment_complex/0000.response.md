### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and stores them in the list `a`.
   - It then adjusts the vertices by subtracting 1 from each to simplify the modulo operations and sorts the list `a`.
   - A set `present` is created to keep track of the vertices that are already chosen.

2. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting the vertices in a circular manner.

3. **Finding Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices in the list `a` (considering the list as circular).
   - These gaps are stored in the list `gaps`.

4. **Processing Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted.
   - For each gap, the program calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added to form additional triangles.
   - If the number of pairs `pairs` is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Triangle Count:**
  - The initial count `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a circular manner.

- **Finding Gaps:**
  - The gaps are correctly calculated and stored in the list `gaps`.

- **Processing Gaps:**
  - The logic for processing gaps is correct. By sorting the gaps, the program ensures that it adds the smallest gaps first, which maximizes the number of triangles that can be formed with the available vertices.
  - The condition `if y >= pairs` ensures that the program only adds as many pairs as it can, and the `else` block correctly handles the case where `y` is insufficient to add all pairs.

- **Output:**
  - The final value of `ans` is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and up to `y` additional vertices. The states and transitions are handled appropriately, and the output is correct for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
