### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it does not match the problem description. The function should be named `max_triangles` and should take parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`.
   - The input handling inside `func_1` is correct, where it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is correct because a polygon with `x` vertices can form `x - 2` triangles by connecting all vertices with diagonals.

3. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, considering the vertices as a circular list. This is done correctly using the modulo operation and an additional `n` when wrapping around.
   - The gaps are stored in a list and then sorted. This is a good approach to ensure that the smallest gaps are considered first when trying to maximize the number of triangles.

4. **Processing Gaps:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted gaps and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added to form triangles.
   - If the number of pairs (`gap // 2`) is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop. This is correct because each pair of vertices can form one additional triangle.

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the gaps to maximize the number of triangles.
- The logic for calculating the number of triangles and updating `ans` is sound.
- However, the function name and the way it is called do not match the problem description, which could lead to confusion or errors if the function is used elsewhere.

### Conclusion:
- Despite the mismatch in function naming, the core logic and implementation of the program are correct.

Correctness: **True**
