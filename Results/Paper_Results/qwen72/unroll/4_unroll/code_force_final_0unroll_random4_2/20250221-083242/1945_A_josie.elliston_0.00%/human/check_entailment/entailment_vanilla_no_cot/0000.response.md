Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, or to return -1 if it is impossible to do so. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the universals can form a complete tent. If they cannot, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. For example:
- If there are more extroverts than can be accommodated with the available universals, it returns -1.
- If there are no participants, it returns 0.
- If there are only introverts, it returns the number of introverts.
- If there are only extroverts and universals, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

Thus, the program is correct.
