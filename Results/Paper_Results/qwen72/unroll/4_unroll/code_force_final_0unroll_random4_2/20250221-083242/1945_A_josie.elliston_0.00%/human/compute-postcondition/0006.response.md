The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers with a maximum value of 10^9. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- Case_1: If the function is supposed to return `None` under certain conditions, but no specific conditions are provided in the problem statement, this case is not clearly defined.
- Case_2: The function returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Since Case_1 is not clearly defined, we will focus on Case_2, which is the primary functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `extroverts` and `universals`, and returns the ceiling of the division of their sum by 3.**
