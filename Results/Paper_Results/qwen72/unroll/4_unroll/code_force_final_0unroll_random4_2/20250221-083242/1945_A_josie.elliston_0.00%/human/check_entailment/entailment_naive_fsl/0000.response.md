Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
a = 1, b = 4, c = 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
- According to the problem, each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.
- We have 4 extroverts and 2 universals.
- The 4 extroverts can be accommodated in 2 tents, each with 3 people (2 extroverts and 1 universal in each tent).
- The remaining 1 universal can be in a tent alone.
- Therefore, the total number of tents needed is 3.

However, the program returns -1, indicating that it incorrectly determines that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
