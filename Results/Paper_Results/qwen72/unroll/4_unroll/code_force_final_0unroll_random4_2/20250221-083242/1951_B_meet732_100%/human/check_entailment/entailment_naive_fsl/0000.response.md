Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow k. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the optimal swap position for cow k to maximize its wins. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5 2
10 5 20 15 25
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation of the test case:
- Initially, the ratings are `[10, 5, 20, 15, 25]`.
- If we do nothing, the matches would be:
  - Match 1: `10` vs `5` (10 wins), ratings become `[10, 20, 15, 25]`.
  - Match 2: `10` vs `20` (20 wins), ratings become `[20, 15, 25]`.
  - Match 3: `20` vs `15` (20 wins), ratings become `[20, 25]`.
  - Match 4: `20` vs `25` (25 wins), ratings become `[25]`.
- Cow 2 (with rating 5) wins 0 matches.

However, if we swap cow 2 with cow 4 (rating 15), the ratings become `[10, 15, 20, 5, 25]`:
- Match 1: `10` vs `15` (15 wins), ratings become `[15, 20, 5, 25]`.
- Match 2: `15` vs `20` (20 wins), ratings become `[20, 5, 25]`.
- Match 3: `20` vs `5` (20 wins), ratings become `[20, 25]`.
- Match 4: `20` vs `25` (25 wins), ratings become `[25]`.
- Cow 2 (now with rating 15) wins 2 matches.

The program does not correctly identify this optimal swap and thus returns an incorrect result.
