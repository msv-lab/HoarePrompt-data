You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow. It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
- If there are no elements in `a` greater than the k-th element's rating (`a[k]`), it returns `n - 1`.
- If there is exactly one element in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
  - If this element is at index 0, it returns `k - 1`.
  - If this element's index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
  - Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of this element.
- If there are exactly two elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
  - If the first of these elements is at index 0, it returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the index of the second element.
  - If `k` is greater than the index of the second element, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination style where each match is between the current cow and the next one in line.
   - We can swap the position of our cow `k` with any other cow once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `l`.
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine the maximum number of wins for our cow.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` and the index `k` of our cow.
   - It initializes `x` with the rating of our cow.
   - It creates a list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and stores their indices in `ind`.

4. **Cases Considered:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - Our cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If this cow is at position 0, our cow can win `k-1` matches.
     - If this cow is after our cow, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is before our cow, our cow can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first cow with a higher rating is at position 0, our cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` or `k - 1` matches.
     - If our cow is after the second cow with a higher rating, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
     - Otherwise, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where our cow is the highest-rated cow.
   - It also handles the case where our cow is the lowest-rated cow.
   - The logic for determining the optimal number of wins is based on the positions of the cows with higher ratings, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the optimal position for our cow to maximize wins by considering the positions of the two highest-rated cows.
   - The logic for each case is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve. The cases considered and the logic used are consistent with the problem description.
