### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination style where each match is between the current cow and the next one in line.
   - We can swap the position of our cow `k` with any other cow once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `l`.
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine the maximum number of wins for our cow.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` and the index `k` of our cow.
   - It initializes `x` with the rating of our cow.
   - It creates a list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and stores their indices in `ind`.

4. **Cases Considered:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - Our cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If this cow is at position 0, our cow can win `k-1` matches.
     - If this cow is after our cow, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is before our cow, our cow can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first cow with a higher rating is at position 0, our cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` or `k - 1` matches.
     - If our cow is after the second cow with a higher rating, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
     - Otherwise, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where our cow is the highest-rated cow.
   - It also handles the case where our cow is the lowest-rated cow.
   - The logic for determining the optimal number of wins is based on the positions of the cows with higher ratings, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the optimal position for our cow to maximize wins by considering the positions of the two highest-rated cows.
   - The logic for each case is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve. The cases considered and the logic used are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
