Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Given that `ind` is a list of length 2 containing indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, the program calculates the difference between `ind[0]` and 1, and the difference between `ind[1]` and `ind[0]`, and returns the larger of these two differences.**
