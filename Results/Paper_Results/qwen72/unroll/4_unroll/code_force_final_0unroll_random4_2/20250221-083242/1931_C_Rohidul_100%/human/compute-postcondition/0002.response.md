The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The function should be able to process up to `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases, with the sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes up to `t` test cases and returns the results for each test case.**
