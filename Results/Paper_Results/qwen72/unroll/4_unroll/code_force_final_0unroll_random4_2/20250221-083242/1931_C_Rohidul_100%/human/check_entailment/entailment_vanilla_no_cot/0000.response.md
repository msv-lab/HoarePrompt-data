Correctness: **True**

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal by applying a specific operation at most once. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
4. It then moves the left pointer `l` to the right as long as the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are the same, and similarly moves the right pointer `r` to the left as long as the elements at `r` and `r - 1` are the same. This is done to find the longest contiguous segments of equal elements at the start and end of the array.
5. It calculates the cost of making the array equal by either:
   - Setting the entire array to the value of the longest contiguous segment (either at the start or the end).
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it considers the combined length of the contiguous segments at the start and end.
6. It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct and aligns with the problem statement. It efficiently finds the minimum cost by leveraging the properties of the array and the operation's cost. Therefore, the program is correct.
