The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which likely represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Since the exact output is not provided, I'll describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
