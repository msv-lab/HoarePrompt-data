Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it handles the visibility of fireworks from both installations.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The program uses `m // a + m // b + 2` to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched from both installations.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` plus 2 (which is not always correct).

2. **Handling of Overlaps:**
   - The program does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. This is crucial for correctly calculating the maximum number of visible fireworks.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
2. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
3. Adjust the count to account for the overlap correctly.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
    if a > b:
        (a, b) = (b, a)
    lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
    max_visible = 1 + (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)
    return max_visible

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))
```

### Explanation:
- **GCD and LCM Calculation:**
  - `gcd(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
  - `lcm(x, y)` calculates the least common multiple of `x` and `y` using the formula `lcm(x, y) = x * y // gcd(x, y)`.
- **Max Fireworks Calculation:**
  - `max_visible = 1 + (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)`:
    - `1` accounts for the initial firework launched at time 0.
    - `(m // a)` and `(m // b)` count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
    - `(m // lcm_ab)` subtracts the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously to avoid double-counting.

This approach correctly handles the visibility of fireworks and ensures that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated accurately.
