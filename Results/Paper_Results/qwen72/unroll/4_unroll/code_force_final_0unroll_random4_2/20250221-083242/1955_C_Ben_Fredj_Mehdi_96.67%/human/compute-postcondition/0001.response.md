The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer value provided by the input, which means `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `z` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
