The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from another input line. The function prints an integer for each test case based on a series of specific conditions. If `k` matches certain predefined values, it prints a corresponding predefined integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, it prints the length of `a`. Otherwise, it performs a series of operations to decrement elements in `a` and prints the count of zeros in the modified list. The final state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will vary depending on the input for each test case.
