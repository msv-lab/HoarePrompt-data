Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3

    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, up to the point where the loop stops (either because `b[j]` does not match `a[i]` or because `j` reaches `m`). The function prints this count `k` and returns nothing. The function is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k` is printed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
