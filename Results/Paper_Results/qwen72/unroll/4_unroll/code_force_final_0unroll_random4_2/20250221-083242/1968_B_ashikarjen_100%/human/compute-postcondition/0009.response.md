Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, the function processes two binary strings `a` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
