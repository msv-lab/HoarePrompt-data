Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it prints `2` or `3` without considering the actual structure of the friendship pairs. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will fail for a different input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
4 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. The correct minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party is `2`, specifically to friends `1` and `2`. Both friends `1` and `2` will come because their best friends `4` and `1` respectively, have also received invitations. The program, however, prints `3` because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed.
