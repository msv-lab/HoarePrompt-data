The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It checks if there is any index `i` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop for that test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3` after completing the loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input `n`. The final state of the program includes `n` lines of output, each containing either `2` or `3` depending on the input for each test case.
