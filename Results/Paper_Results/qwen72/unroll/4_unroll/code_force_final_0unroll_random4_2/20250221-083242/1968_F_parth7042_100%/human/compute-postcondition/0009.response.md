Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and determines for each query whether the XOR of the elements in the specified subarray of `a` is zero or if there exists a subarray with the same XOR value that can be swapped to make the XOR zero. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the `index` variable is updated to `1 + 2 * t + 2 * (n + q)`, and the `results` list contains the results of all queries. **
