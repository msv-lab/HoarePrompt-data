Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings containing the input values. `index` is 0.**
