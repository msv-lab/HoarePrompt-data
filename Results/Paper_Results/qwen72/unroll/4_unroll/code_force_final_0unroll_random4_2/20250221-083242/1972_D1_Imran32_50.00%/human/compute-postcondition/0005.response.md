To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` retain their initial values.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.
- `root` remains equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` and `k` are given but their specific values are not provided.
   - `ans` is initially some value (let's denote it as `ans_initial`).
   - `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Update to `ans`**:
   - The expression `sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))` is evaluated.
   - This sum iterates over the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each `i` in this range, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds the result to the sum.
   - The result of this sum is then added to the initial value of `ans` (`ans_initial`).

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - The final value of `ans` is `ans_initial + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the updated value of `ans`, which is the sum of the initial value of `ans` (`ans_initial`) and the sum of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` in the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `ans_initial` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the formula used to update `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the initial value of ans and the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for each i in the range from 2 to root + 1, and root is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)**
