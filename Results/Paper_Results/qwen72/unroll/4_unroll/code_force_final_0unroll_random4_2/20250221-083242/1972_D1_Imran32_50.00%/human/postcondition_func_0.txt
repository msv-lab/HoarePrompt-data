The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, and calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of the initial value of `n` and the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each integer `i` in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. It then prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial values after the function call.
