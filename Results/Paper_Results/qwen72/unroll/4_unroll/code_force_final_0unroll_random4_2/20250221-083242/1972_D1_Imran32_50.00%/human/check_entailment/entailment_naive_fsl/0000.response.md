Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function `func_1` is not correctly solving the problem as described. For example, for the input (2, 3), the correct output should be 3, but the program will not produce this output due to incorrect logic in the loop and the way `ans` is calculated. The program seems to be attempting a different calculation, which does not match the problem description.
