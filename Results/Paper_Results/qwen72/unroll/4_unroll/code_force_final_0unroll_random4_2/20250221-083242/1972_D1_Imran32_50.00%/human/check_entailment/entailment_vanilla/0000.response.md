### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem asks to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program provided is:
     ```python
     import math

     t = int(input())
     for _ in range(t):
         func_1()

     def func_1():
         (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
         ans = n
         root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
         for i in range(2, root + 1):
             cnt = i * i
             ans += (n + i) // cnt
         print(ans)
     ```
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input.
     - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
     - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\).
     - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Errors:**
   - The function `func_1` reads \(k\) but does not use it in any calculations. This suggests that the function is not correctly addressing the problem, which involves both \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to be related to the problem's conditions. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked or used in the calculations.
   - The loop and the update to `ans` do not align with the problem's requirements. The loop is iterating over the square root of \(n\) and updating `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the problem's constraints.

4. **Correctness:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and does not use the second input \(m\) in any meaningful way.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
