The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `root`, and the range parameters `2` and `root + 1`. To ensure the loop executes, the range must have at least one value, which means `root + 1` must be greater than `2`. Therefore, `root` must be at least `2`.

Given that `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, for `root` to be at least `2`, `n` must be at least `1` (since `int(math.sqrt(1)) + 1` is `2`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `1` and `i` starts at `2`.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `ans` is equal to `n`, `m` is not affected, `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `i` is 2**
