The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
