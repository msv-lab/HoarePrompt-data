Output State: **t is an input integer, n, k, x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. For each test case, the maximum possible value of the modified sum of the list a is printed.**
