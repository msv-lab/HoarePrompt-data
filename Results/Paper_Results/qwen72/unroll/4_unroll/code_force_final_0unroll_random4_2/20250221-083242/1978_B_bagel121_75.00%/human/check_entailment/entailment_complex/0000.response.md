### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which are within the specified range (1 to 10^9).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The function checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If this condition is true, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. This is because the modified price for the first `k` buns will be less than or equal to `a`, and selling all buns at `a` coins each will maximize the profit.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the function proceeds to calculate the optimal profit using the promotion.

3. **Promotion Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that `k` is within the valid range (0 to `n`).
   - The sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b` is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}\). This formula correctly computes the total profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`, and the profit from these buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total profit for each test case, which is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining buns.
   - The output is correctly formatted as a single integer for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `a` is equal to `b` (all buns are sold at the usual price).
   - It also handles the case when `n` is very large (up to 10^9) and ensures that the calculations do not overflow by using integer division and multiplication.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
