### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a` (the usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (the modified price of the first bun).
   - If `a >= b`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any additional benefit. The profit in this case is `n * a`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.
   - The optimal `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the range where the modified price is beneficial.
   - The formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)` calculates the sum of the first `k` modified prices. This is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.

4. **Remaining Buns Calculation:**
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit from these buns is `(n - k) * a`.

5. **Total Profit Calculation:**
   - The total profit is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining buns.
   - The program prints the total profit for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Modified prices: `5 + 4 = 9`.
  - Remaining buns: `2 * 4 = 8`.
  - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.
  - Expected output: `17`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Modified prices: `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.
  - Remaining buns: `0 * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.
  - Expected output: `35`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.
  - Expected output: `100`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Modified prices: `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.
  - Remaining buns: `0 * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `45 + 0 = 45`.
  - Expected output: `45`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
  - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
  - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
  - Modified prices: `1000 + 999 + 998 + ... + 1 = 500500`.
  - Remaining buns: `0 * 1 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `500500 + 0 = 500500`.
  - Expected output: `500500`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum profit by considering the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

Correctness: **True**
