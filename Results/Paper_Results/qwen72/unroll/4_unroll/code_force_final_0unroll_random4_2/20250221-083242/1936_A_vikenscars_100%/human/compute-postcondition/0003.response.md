Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the largest item in the range 1 to n-1, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.** 

The value of `max_item_idx` remains unchanged, and `pair_idx` is now set to the same value as `max_item_idx`. The condition that `func_1` returns '<' when the item at index `i` is larger than the item at `max_item_idx` is still valid.
