To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

Initial State:
- `pair_idx` is the index of the largest item in the range 0 to n-1.
- `max_item_idx` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pair_idx`**:
   - According to the initial state, `pair_idx` is the index of the largest item in the range 0 to n-1.
   - This means `pair_idx` is the index of the largest element in a list or array of length n.

2. **`max_item_idx`**:
   - The variable `max_item_idx` is not defined in the initial state.
   - Since `max_item_idx` is used in the `print` statement, it must be defined somewhere in the code, but we don't have that information in the initial state.
   - Without the definition of `max_item_idx`, we cannot determine its exact value.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output a string that includes the value of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. Since `pair_idx` is defined in the initial state, we can describe its value. However, `max_item_idx` is not defined, so we can only indicate that it is a variable whose value is unknown.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where `max_item_idx` is the value of the undefined variable `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` is the index of the largest item in the range 0 to n-1)**
