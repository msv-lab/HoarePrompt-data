### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to use these queries to identify the indices that maximize the XOR operation.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b, c, d)`**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives a comparison result.
   - It prints the query in the required format and flushes the output to ensure the interactor receives it.
   - It then reads the input from the interactor and returns the comparison result.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item:**
     - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
     - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
     - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to an index with a high value in the permutation.

   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates over all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\) is equal, it further compares \(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - This step ensures that `pair_idx` points to an index that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives a high value.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times.
   - The second loop runs \(n\) times.
   - In total, the function makes \(2n-1\) queries, which is within the limit of \(3n\).

5. **Output:**
   - After finding the indices, the function prints the result in the required format and does not consider it as a query.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem constraints and uses the queries efficiently to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation. The logic is sound and the number of queries does not exceed the allowed limit.

**Correctness: True**
