Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= `i` < `n`. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`. `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, and `b` is the integer division result of `k // 2`. `ans` is 0. `s_a` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `s_a` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
