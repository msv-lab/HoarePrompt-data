You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in the list `nums` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the prefix sum being less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and the number of elements that contribute to the suffix sum being less than or equal to `k // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Sum Check:**
   - The program first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities `sum(nums)`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all durabilities, it means all ships will sink, and the function returns `n` (the total number of ships).

3. **Attack Distribution:**
   - The program calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively.
   - This is a correct approach because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, and the total number of attacks is split accordingly.

4. **Counting Sunk Ships:**
   - The program initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to keep track of the cumulative durability of the first and last ships being attacked.
   - It iterates through the ships, adding the durability of the current ship to `s_a` and the durability of the corresponding last ship to `s_b`.
   - If the cumulative durability `s_a` is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the first ships (`a`), it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - Similarly, if the cumulative durability `s_b` is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the last ships (`b`), it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where a ship is counted as sunk multiple times. For example, if a ship is attacked from both the front and the back, it should not be counted twice.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the removal of sunk ships from the list. It simply sums the durabilities and checks against the attack counts, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - The program should correctly determine that the first and fourth ships sink.
  - However, the program might count the first ship twice if it is attacked from both the front and the back.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 6`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - The program should correctly determine that the first, second, and fourth ships sink.
  - However, the program might count the first ship twice if it is attacked from both the front and the back.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `k = 20`, `nums = [2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
  - The program should correctly determine that all ships sink.
  - However, the program might count some ships multiple times if they are attacked from both the front and the back.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `nums = [3, 2]`
  - The program should correctly determine that no ships sink.
  - However, the program might count the first ship twice if it is attacked from both the front and the back.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 15`, `nums = [1, 5]`
  - The program should correctly determine that both ships sink.
  - However, the program might count the first ship twice if it is attacked from both the front and the back.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 7`, `nums = [5, 2]`
  - The program should correctly determine that both ships sink.
  - However, the program might count the first ship twice if it is attacked from both the front and the back.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the removal of sunk ships from the list. It can count a ship as sunk multiple times, leading to incorrect results.
