#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the positive integer `n`, which is the number of elements in the list `nums`.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `s_a` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in the list `nums` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the prefix sum being less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and the number of elements that contribute to the suffix sum being less than or equal to `k // 2`.
