### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the \( i \)-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell \( i \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to calculate the cumulative effect of movements and inversions.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes the string `s1` of length `n`.
     - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - It calculates the total number of '>' characters (`totalOne`).
     - It creates a prefix sum array `preOne` for the indices of '>' characters.
     - It initializes a suffix sum array `suffZero` for the indices of '<' characters.
     - It iterates over the string from right to left.
     - For each cell:
       - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the prefix and suffix arrays.
       - If the cell contains '<', it updates the suffix sum array and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - It prints the results for each cell.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses prefix and suffix sums to efficiently calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for handling '>' and '<' characters is correct:
     - For '>', it calculates the time based on the number of '>' and '<' characters to the right.
     - For '<', it calculates the time based on the number of '>' and '<' characters to the left.
   - The program correctly inverts the characters and updates the prefix and suffix sums accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the grid is entirely filled with '>' or '<'.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is empty (though the problem constraints guarantee \( n \geq 1 \)).

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses efficient data structures (prefix and suffix sums) to handle the calculations in linear time.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n) \) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules. The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures efficient computation, and the logic for handling each character is sound.

Correctness: **True**
