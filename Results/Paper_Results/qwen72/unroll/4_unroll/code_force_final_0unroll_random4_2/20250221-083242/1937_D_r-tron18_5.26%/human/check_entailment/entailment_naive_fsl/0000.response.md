Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters in the grid. Instead, it uses a complex set of precomputed values and conditions that do not align with the straightforward movement and inversion rules specified in the problem description.

A simple counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
3
>><
```

Expected Output:
```
3 4 2
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
The program does not produce the correct output for this input. The expected output is derived from simulating the pinball's movement and inversion for each cell:

- For the 1st cell (index 0): The pinball moves right to the 2nd cell, then right to the 3rd cell, and then leaves the grid. This takes 3 seconds.
- For the 2nd cell (index 1): The pinball moves right to the 3rd cell, then left to the 2nd cell, and then right to the 3rd cell again, and finally leaves the grid. This takes 4 seconds.
- For the 3rd cell (index 2): The pinball moves left to the 2nd cell, and then leaves the grid. This takes 2 seconds.

The provided program does not simulate this behavior correctly, leading to incorrect results.
