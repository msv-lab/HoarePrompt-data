### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each with a grid length `n` and a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2(s1, n)`, which processes the string and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)` returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to calculate the cumulative sum of positions in the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists, adjusted by the `times` parameter.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>', initialized by enumerating the string `s1`.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of the indices in `pre`, with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
   - **Processing:**
     - The function iterates over the string `s1` from the last character to the first.
     - For each character, it updates the `ans` list based on whether the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list with the cumulative sum of positions of '<' characters.
   - **Output:**
     - The function prints the `ans` list, which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the pinball movement rules:
     - If the pinball starts on a '>' cell, it moves right and the cell is inverted to '<'.
     - If the pinball starts on a '<' cell, it moves left and the cell is inverted to '>'.
   - The cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero` are used to efficiently calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The function correctly accounts for the inversion of cells and the movement of the pinball until it leaves the grid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the string `s1` consists entirely of '<' or '>' characters.
   - It also handles the case where the string is of length 1.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, based on the given rules and constraints. The use of cumulative sums and the inversion of cells are correctly handled.

Correctness: **True**
