Reasoning:  
The program has a logical error in how it handles the number of test cases. According to the problem description, the number of test cases `t` is provided as the first input, and the program should read `t` pairs of integers, not a fixed 10 pairs. This means the loop that reads the pairs of integers should iterate `t` times, not 10 times. Additionally, the loop that prints the results should also iterate `t` times, not 10 times. The current implementation will always read and print 10 pairs, regardless of the value of `t`, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
