Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. However, it does not use `t` in the subsequent loop, which is a potential issue. The loop always runs 10 times, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should control the loop.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads two integers `x` and `y` for each test case and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct, but it should be controlled by the number of test cases `t`, not a fixed 10.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. This part is logically correct, as it correctly determines and prints the minimum and maximum values.

4. **Fixed Loop Issue**: The loop that reads the test cases should run `t` times, not 10 times. This is a critical error because it will either read too many or too few test cases depending on the value of `t`.

5. **Correct Loop**: The loop should be modified to:
   ```python
   for i in range(int(t)):
   ```

Given the issues, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
