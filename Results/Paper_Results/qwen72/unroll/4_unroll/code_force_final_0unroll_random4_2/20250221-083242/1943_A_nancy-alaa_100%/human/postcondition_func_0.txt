The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` where each integer in `arr` is less than `n`. It then prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i <= n) that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without preserving any state.
