You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` for each test case, and prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i <= n) that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case, and the variable `first` is used to track the first unique integer encountered in the current test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not preserved, and `first` is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` where each integer in `arr` is less than `n`. It then prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i <= n) that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without preserving any state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends elements to an array `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` when the game ends.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest available element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from picking the smallest available element by deleting it if it is unique in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the MEX:
     - If an element `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not exist in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If an element `i` is in the `Counter` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If an element `i` is in the `Counter` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` (MEX).
   - The `first` flag is used to ensure that if there is a unique element, Bob will delete it on his turn, and Alice will not be able to pick it.
   - The program breaks the loop as soon as it finds the MEX, which is the correct behavior.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` (MEX is `n`).
   - The program handles the case where `arr` contains duplicate elements correctly.
   - The program handles the case where `arr` is empty (MEX is 0).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and finds the MEX of the array `c` when the game ends. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
