Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
2
```

The program prints the modified list and the number of zeros in the list, but it does not compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The correct output should be the minimum number of operations, which in this case is 1 (moving the chip from the 7th cell to the 5th cell).

The program should instead count the number of gaps between chips and determine the minimum number of moves required to close those gaps. The current logic does not handle this correctly.
