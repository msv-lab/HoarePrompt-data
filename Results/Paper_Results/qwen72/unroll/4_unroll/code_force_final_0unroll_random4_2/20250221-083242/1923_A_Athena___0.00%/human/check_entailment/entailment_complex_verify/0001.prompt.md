You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined input mechanism, as it does not have any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells on the ribbon, followed by a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). There is at least one chip in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the list `a` will be printed after removing leading and trailing zeros, and the integer `res` will be printed, representing the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `a` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `res` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input consisting of multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers representing the state of a ribbon, where 0s indicate free cells and 1s indicate cells with chips. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list and prints the modified list. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the modified list and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program trims leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop: `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also trims trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop: `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step is crucial because it focuses on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips, ignoring the free cells at the beginning and end.

3. **Counting Gaps:**
   - The program then iterates through the trimmed list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) within the segment containing chips.
   - The variable `res` is used to store this count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of zeros, which is supposed to be the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

### Analysis:

- **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
  - This step is correct because it ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips and the free cells between them.
  - This is necessary to focus on the relevant part of the ribbon for the operations.

- **Counting Gaps:**
  - The program counts the number of zeros within the trimmed list `a`.
  - However, this approach is incorrect because it counts the total number of free cells within the segment, not the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

### Correct Approach:

- To find the minimum number of operations, we need to:
  - Identify the positions of all chips.
  - Calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips into a single block.
  - This can be done by finding the smallest gap between any two chips and moving chips to fill this gap.

### Example:

For the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
- The trimmed list is: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- The correct answer should be 1, as moving the chip from the 7th cell to the 5th cell forms a single block.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for counting the number of free cells within the segment is incorrect. It should instead calculate the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. It counts the total number of free cells within the segment, which is not the correct approach.
