### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Condition**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is because any cut parallel to one of the sides will result in at least one of the resulting rectangles having a non-integer side. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **One Dimension is Half of the Other**:
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other (i.e., `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`), the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of the same size. However, these two smaller rectangles can only be recombined to form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it, which is considered the same. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Other Cases**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is because:
     - If one of the dimensions is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be recombined to form a different rectangle.
     - If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can be cut in multiple ways, and the resulting smaller rectangles can be recombined to form different rectangles.
     - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can still be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be recombined to form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It prints 'NO' when both dimensions are odd or when one dimension is exactly half of the other, and it prints 'YES' in all other cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
