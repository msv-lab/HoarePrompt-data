Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal, such as a 2x2 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 2x2 rectangle can indeed be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2 rectangle. The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is too restrictive and does not account for the possibility of forming a different rectangle when both dimensions are even and equal.

The program should output "YES" for such cases, but it does not. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

Final: **False**
