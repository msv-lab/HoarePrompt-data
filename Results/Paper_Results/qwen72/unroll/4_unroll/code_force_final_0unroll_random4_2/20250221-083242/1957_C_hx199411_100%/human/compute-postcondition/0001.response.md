The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is greater than 0, and the loop will execute.

State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two moves share the same row or column. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
