The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` indicates the type of constraint and `x` is the value. The function calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case that satisfy the following conditions: `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. The function returns a list `r` where each element corresponds to a test case and represents the count of valid integers `k`. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0. The function then prints each element of `r` on a new line.
