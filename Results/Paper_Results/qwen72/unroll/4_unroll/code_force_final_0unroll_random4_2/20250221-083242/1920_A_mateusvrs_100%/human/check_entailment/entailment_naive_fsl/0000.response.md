Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the constraints as specified. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number and `bx` to a very small number to handle the minimum and maximum bounds for `k`.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
3. **Validation**:
   - If `bx` (the minimum bound) is greater than `ax` (the maximum bound), it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy the constraints by subtracting the number of excluded integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range.
4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints correctly, ensuring that the number of valid integers `k` is computed accurately for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
