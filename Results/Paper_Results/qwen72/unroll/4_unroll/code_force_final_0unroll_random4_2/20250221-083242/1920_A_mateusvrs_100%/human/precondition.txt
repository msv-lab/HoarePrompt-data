t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^9. For each test case, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
