The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Based on the initial state, `r` is a list where each element corresponds to a test case and represents the count of integers `k` that meet the specified conditions. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.

Since the exact values of the test cases and the constraints are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `r`. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **[r[0]]  
[r[1]]  
[r[2]]  
...  
[r[n-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the count of valid integers `k` for the corresponding test case, and n is the number of test cases)**

This means that each element in the list `r` will be printed on a new line, and each element represents the count of valid integers `k` for the corresponding test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element will be 0.
