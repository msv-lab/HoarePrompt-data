The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function processes a set of test cases and constraints for each test case. Each test case is defined by an integer `n`, which represents the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` is the type of constraint and `x` is the value associated with that constraint. The function is expected to determine a value `k` that satisfies all the given constraints for each test case and return the results for all test cases.

The constraints for each test case are:
- `a=1` means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
- `a=2` means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`.
- `a=3` means `k` must be not equal to `x`.

The function must handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of constraints, and return a value `k` that satisfies all constraints for each test case. If no such `k` exists for a test case, the function should indicate this.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It returns a value `k` for each test case that satisfies all the given constraints, or indicates if no such `k` exists.**
