You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: `r` is a list containing the number of valid integers `k` for each test case, where `k` satisfies all the given constraints. Each element in `r` corresponds to a test case and represents the count of integers `k` that meet the conditions: `k` is greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [r[0]]  
    #[r[1]]  
    #[r[2]]  
    #...  
    #[r[n-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the count of valid integers `k` for the corresponding test case, and n is the number of test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` indicates the type of constraint and `x` is the value. The function calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case that satisfy the following conditions: `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. The function returns a list `r` where each element corresponds to a test case and represents the count of valid integers `k`. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0. The function then prints each element of `r` on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraints Processing:**
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). These variables are used to track the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - It also initializes a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Constraint Types:**
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 3 (k must not be equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation of Bounds:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ax` is initialized to a large number to ensure that any valid upper bound will be smaller.
  - `bx` is initialized to a small number to ensure that any valid lower bound will be larger.
  - `cx` is a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, ensuring no duplicates.

- **Processing Constraints:**
  - For type 1 constraints, `bx` is updated to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring that `k` is at least as large as the largest lower bound.
  - For type 2 constraints, `ax` is updated to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring that `k` is at most as large as the smallest upper bound.
  - For type 3 constraints, `x` is added to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` cannot be any of these values.

- **Range Calculation:**
  - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so the result is 0.
  - Otherwise, the range `[bx, ax]` is valid, and the program calculates the number of integers in this range (`ax - bx + 1`).
  - It then subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
