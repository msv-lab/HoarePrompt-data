Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program but is slightly inaccurate in its explanation. The program does handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif b < c:` ensures that if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, the program prints "NO". This aligns with the problem description, which states that it is impossible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves if `n < m`.

However, the original assessment mentions that the program incorrectly prints "YES" when `n == m`. This is actually correct behavior according to the problem description. If `n == m`, it means Nikita can achieve a tower with exactly `m` cubes by simply adding one cube per move for `n` moves. Therefore, the program should print "YES" in this case, and it does.

The remaining logic in the program is also correct:
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to achieve a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and `b - c` will be even if `b` and `c` have the same parity.
- If `b` and `c` do not have the same parity, it is impossible to achieve a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, and the program correctly prints "No".

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
