### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the parity of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. For example, if `b` is even, the number of cubes added or removed must also be even to end up with an even number of cubes.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if the parities do not match, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions described above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It also correctly checks the conditions to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
