### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent `n` and `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result:**
   - The program checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes). If so, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes'. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even to result in a tower with the same parity as the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No' because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be odd, which is not possible with an even number of moves or vice versa.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' in the correct format, as specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'.
     - When `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
     - When `b` and `c` have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'.
     - When `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No'.

5. **Final State:**
   - The variable `a` is decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed, which is expected.
   - The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but their final values are not retained after the loop completes, which is also expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Nikita can build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all the specified conditions and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
