You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `a` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` (if they exist) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the function. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is always possible to achieve this by simply adding `c` cubes one by one. Therefore, the output should be "YES".
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves you have. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same, it is possible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because you can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final number of cubes matches the desired number. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, you can add `c` cubes and then remove the remaining cubes to make the total moves `b`. Similarly, if both are odd, you can achieve the same.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is different, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because the number of cubes added or removed must always result in a number of cubes that has the same parity as the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number).

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem.
- It ensures that the output is "Yes" or "No" based on the parity and the relationship between `b` and `c`.
- The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
