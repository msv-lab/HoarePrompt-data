Output State: **The variable `a` is decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `b` and `c` from input, and prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.**
