### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is indeed possible to achieve this by adding `c` cubes one by one. The output "YES" is correct.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves you have. The output "NO" is correct.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same, it is possible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because you can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final number of cubes matches the desired number. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, you can add `c` cubes and then remove the remaining cubes to make the total moves `b`. Similarly, if both are odd, you can achieve the same. The output "Yes" is correct.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is different, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because the number of cubes added or removed must always result in a number of cubes that has the same parity as the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number). The output "No" is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies and explains the logic behind each condition.
- The conditions and their corresponding outputs are accurately described and match the problem requirements.
- The function handles all edge cases and valid inputs as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
