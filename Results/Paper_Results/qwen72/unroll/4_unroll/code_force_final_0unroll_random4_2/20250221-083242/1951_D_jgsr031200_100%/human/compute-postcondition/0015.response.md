Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - Since `n` is 0, this expression becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - The result of `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 because any integer divided by a non-zero integer is 0 when the numerator is 0.
   - `n // 1`:
     - Since `n` is 0, this expression becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition:**
   - The current value of `h` is less than `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this condition is satisfied for any positive value of `k`.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'.
   - The value of `h` being less than `k` does not affect the `print` statement directly, but it is part of the initial state and helps confirm that the conditions leading to this state are met.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
