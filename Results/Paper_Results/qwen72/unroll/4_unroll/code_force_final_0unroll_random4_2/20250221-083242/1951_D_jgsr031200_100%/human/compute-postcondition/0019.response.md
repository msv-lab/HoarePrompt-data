Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - Since `n` is 0, this expression becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - If `k` is 1, then `1 - k` is 0, and division by zero is undefined. However, since the problem states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, we can assume `k` is not 1.
     - For any other value of `k`, `1 - k` is a non-zero integer, and `0 // (1 - k)` is 0.
   - `n // 1`:
     - Since `n` is 0, this expression is `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition on `h`:**
   - The problem states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this implies that `k` must be 0 or less than 0.
   - However, the problem also states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, and given that `h` is 0, the only consistent value for `k` is 0.

4. **`costs` remains unchanged:**
   - The precondition states that `costs` remains unchanged, so whatever the initial value of `costs` was, it will be printed as is.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs`, so each element of `costs` will be printed separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the elements of the `costs` list printed as they are.

Output: **[elements of costs] (where costs is the unchanged list of elements)**
