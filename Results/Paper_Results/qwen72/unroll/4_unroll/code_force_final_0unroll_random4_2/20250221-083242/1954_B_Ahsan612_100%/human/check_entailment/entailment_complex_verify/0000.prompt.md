You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program: 
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the length of the array and an array a of integers. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element a_i in the array a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that are not the same. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program updates `num` and increments `i` in a way that it skips over elements, which can lead to incorrect results.

A correct approach would need to consider the entire array and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The current logic does not handle this correctly and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
