### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array "not beautiful". If it's impossible, return -1.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, `minn` to infinity, and `i` to 1.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and moves to the next segment.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints -1 (indicating the array is uniform or no valid segment was found).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is uniform (all elements are the same). In such cases, the program should always print -1 because removing any number of elements will not make the array "not beautiful".
   - The program also does not correctly handle the case where the array is already "not beautiful" (i.e., no valid operation can be applied to make all elements the same).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program fails to correctly handle the uniform array case.
   - The program does not correctly identify when the array is already "not beautiful".

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the uniform array case and does not correctly identify when the array is already "not beautiful".

**Correctness: False**
