The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `f`, and `k`: Integers for each test case such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, where `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `f` and `k` are additional integers with specific constraints.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, where `a_i` represents the elements of the list.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
