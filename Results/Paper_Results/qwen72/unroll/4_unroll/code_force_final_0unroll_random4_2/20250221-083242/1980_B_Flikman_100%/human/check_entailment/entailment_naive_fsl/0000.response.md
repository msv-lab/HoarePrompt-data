Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and it is not clear if it will be removed or not. Specifically, the program only counts the number of times the favorite value is removed, but it does not consider the position of the favorite cube after sorting. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has the value 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`. In the first case, the favorite cube is removed, and in the second case, it is not. The program, however, will always output "MAYBE" for this input, which is not correct because it should output "YES" if the favorite cube is always removed and "NO" if it is never removed. 

The issue lies in the logic that only counts the number of times the favorite value is removed without considering the specific position of the favorite cube.
