You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a list of four integers `a`. It calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in `a` are all odd) and the floor division of each integer in `a` by 2. The function prints `cnt` for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial sequence results in a zero XOR, and Bob wins immediately. For example, consider the input `0 0 0 1` (one 4 in the sequence). The XOR of a single 4 is 4, which is non-zero, so Alice wins. However, if we remove the 4, the sequence becomes empty, and the XOR of an empty sequence is considered zero, so Bob should win. The program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output `0` instead of `1`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the number of ones, twos, and threes are all even. For example, consider the input `2 2 2 0`. The XOR of this sequence is zero, so Bob wins immediately. The program will output `3` instead of `1` because it incorrectly adds the floor division of each count by 2 without considering the initial XOR.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the initial XOR of the sequence.
2. If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins immediately.
3. If the initial XOR is non-zero, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR becomes zero as many times as possible. This involves removing pairs of numbers that contribute to the XOR in a way that maintains the balance of the sequence.
