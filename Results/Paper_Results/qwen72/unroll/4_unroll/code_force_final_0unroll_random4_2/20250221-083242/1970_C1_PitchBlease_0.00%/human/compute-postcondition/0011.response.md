Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer between 1 and n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the given edges, identifies the leaves of the tree, and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the starting node to two different leaves. Based on the parity of the distances found, it returns 'Ron' if either distance is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. **
