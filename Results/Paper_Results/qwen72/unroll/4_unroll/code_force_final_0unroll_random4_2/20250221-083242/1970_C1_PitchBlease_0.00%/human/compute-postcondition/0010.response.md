The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in a tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and each tuple represents an edge in the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game. The function returns either the string 'Ron' or the string 'Hermione' based on the game's outcome.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer between 1 and n representing the starting node). It returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the game's outcome.**
