Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9. The function then compares the digits of `a` and `b` at each position. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the first difference encountered results in the smaller digit being added to `kq1` and the larger digit to `kq2`, and for all subsequent differences, the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit to `kq2`. After processing each test case, the function prints the two resulting strings `kq1` and `kq2`. The function does not return any value. **
