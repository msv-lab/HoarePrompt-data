Output State: **The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The variable `a` is now the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
