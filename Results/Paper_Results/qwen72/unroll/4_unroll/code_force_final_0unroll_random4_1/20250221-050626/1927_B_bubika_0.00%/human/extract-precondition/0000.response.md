Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the inputs as described. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def find_string(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a` of integers representing the trace of the string for each test case. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (11, [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]),
    (10, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]),
    (1, [0]),
    (8, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]),
    (8, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
]
```

This way, the function can process multiple test cases as described in the problem.
