The function `func` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `s`. It constructs and prints a string `r` of length `n` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the string `a` ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). The string `a` remains unchanged, and the list `b` is modified to reflect the cumulative frequency of each integer in all traces across all test cases. The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings for each test case.
