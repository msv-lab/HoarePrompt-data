### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If the XOR of the sequence is 0, Bob wins.
   - If the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - The key is to understand how the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number affects the XOR result.

5. **Parity Analysis**:
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the counts of each number that contributes to the XOR (i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 4) are even.
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, removing one of each will make the counts even, and the XOR will be zero.

6. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the integer division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.

7. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the initial condition where all counts of 1, 2, and 3 are odd, which ensures that Bob wins once.
   - The program then adds the integer division of each count by 2 to `cnt`. This is because each pair of the same number will result in a zero XOR, and removing such pairs will not change the winning condition.
   - The program prints the value of `cnt` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
