### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will not change the XOR of the sequence.
   - Removing a single number from an odd count of a specific number can change the XOR of the sequence.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each number (1, 2, 3, 4), the number of pairs that can be removed is \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - Removing pairs does not affect the XOR of the sequence.

6. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, removing one of each will make the counts even, and the XOR of the sequence will be zero.
   - This is because the XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is non-zero, and removing one of each will make the counts even, leading to a zero XOR.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the number of pairs for each count to `cnt` using \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd.
   - It correctly counts the number of pairs for each count.
   - The total count `cnt` represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

Correctness: **True**
