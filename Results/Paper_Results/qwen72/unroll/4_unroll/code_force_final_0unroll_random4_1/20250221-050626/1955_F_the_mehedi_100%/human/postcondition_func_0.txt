The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a list of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` which is incremented by 1 if the first three integers in the list are all odd, and then by the integer division of each integer in the list by 2. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case. The initial state of the input variables `t` and `p_i` remains unchanged, and the function does not return any value.
