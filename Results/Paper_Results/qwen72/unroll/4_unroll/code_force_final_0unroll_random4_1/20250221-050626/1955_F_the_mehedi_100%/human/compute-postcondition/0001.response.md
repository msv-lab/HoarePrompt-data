Output State: **For each test case, the output is the value of `cnt` after the loop has finished executing. `cnt` is calculated by adding 1 if all the first three elements of the list `a` are odd, and then adding the integer division of each element in `a` by 2. The initial state of `t` and `p_i` remains unchanged.**
