Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Initial Check for Bob's Win:**
   - The program checks if all counts of `1`s, `2`s, and `3`s are odd and increments `cnt` by 1 if they are. This is not a valid condition for determining Bob's initial win. The correct condition is that the total number of odd numbers (1 and 3) should be even for Bob to win initially.

2. **Counting Bob's Wins:**
   - The program increments `cnt` by `math.floor(x / 2)` for each count `x` in the list `a`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal removal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the following:

- **Initial Condition:** Bob wins if the total number of odd numbers (1 and 3) is even.
- **Optimal Removal:** Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the parity of the total number of odd numbers is maintained to maximize Bob's wins.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def max_bob_wins():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_odd = a[0] + a[2]
        total_even = a[1] + a[3]
        
        # Initial win condition for Bob
        initial_bob_win = (total_odd % 2 == 0)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins
        max_wins = 0
        if initial_bob_win:
            max_wins = (sum(a) // 2)
        else:
            max_wins = (sum(a) - 1) // 2
        
        print(max_wins)

max_bob_wins()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Initial Condition:**
   - Calculate the total number of odd numbers (`total_odd`) and even numbers (`total_even`).
   - Check if `total_odd` is even. If it is, Bob wins initially.

2. **Optimal Removal:**
   - If Bob wins initially, the maximum number of Bob's wins is half the total number of numbers (`sum(a) // 2`).
   - If Alice wins initially, the maximum number of Bob's wins is one less than half the total number of numbers (`(sum(a) - 1) // 2`).

This approach ensures that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
