You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is the value of `cnt` after the loop has finished executing. `cnt` is calculated by adding 1 if all the first three elements of the list `a` are odd, and then adding the integer division of each element in `a` by 2. The initial state of `t` and `p_i` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will not change the XOR of the sequence.
   - Removing a single number from an odd count of a specific number can change the XOR of the sequence.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each number (1, 2, 3, 4), the number of pairs that can be removed is \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - Removing pairs does not affect the XOR of the sequence.

6. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, removing one of each will make the counts even, and the XOR of the sequence will be zero.
   - This is because the XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is non-zero, and removing one of each will make the counts even, leading to a zero XOR.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the number of pairs for each count to `cnt` using \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd.
   - It correctly counts the number of pairs for each count.
   - The total count `cnt` represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
