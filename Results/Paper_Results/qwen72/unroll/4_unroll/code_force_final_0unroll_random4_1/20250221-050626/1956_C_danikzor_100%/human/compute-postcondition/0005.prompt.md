You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the integer input by the user)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `t` (the number of test cases) also remains unchanged. The loop prints two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, where the first line starts with `1` followed by `i` and then the integers from `n` to `1` in descending order, and the second line starts with `2` followed by `i` and then the integers from `n` to `1` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function handles multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the size of an n×n matrix. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
