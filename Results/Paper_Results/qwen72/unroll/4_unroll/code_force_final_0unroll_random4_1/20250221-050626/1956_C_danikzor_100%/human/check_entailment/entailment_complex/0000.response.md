Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called, which reads the integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers, which is correct for the given problem.
   - The number of operations `2 * n` is also correctly calculated, as it ensures that the maximum sum can be achieved within the allowed limit.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation, setting the row to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation, setting the column to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

4. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The permutations used in the operations are valid, as they consist of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The operations are performed correctly, and the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, with the first line containing the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Each subsequent line correctly describes the type of operation, the row or column index, and the permutation used.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
