You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players after all the games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed t times, and for each iteration, it will have processed the input scores p1, p2, and p3, printing the appropriate result based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of p1, p2, and p3 will be updated with each iteration, but the initial values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 provided as input to the function will remain unchanged. The number of test cases t will also remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) representing the scores of the three players. The function returns the result of the game for each test case based on the scores provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
