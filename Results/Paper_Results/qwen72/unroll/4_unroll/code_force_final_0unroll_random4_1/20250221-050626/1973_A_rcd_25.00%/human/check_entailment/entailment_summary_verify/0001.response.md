### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total points in any set of games must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Score Consistency Check:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, all games could have ended in draws, and the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2`.

4. **Complex Case Handling:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds.
   - If the condition holds, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

5. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The complex case logic is intended to find the maximum number of draws such that the scores remain consistent.
   - However, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` and the final print statement `p1 - cur + p3` do not correctly account for the total number of draws.
   - The condition should ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws are still consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The final print statement should correctly reflect the maximum number of draws that can be distributed among the players.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the basic cases where the total score is odd or `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The complex case logic, however, is flawed. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` and the final print statement `p1 - cur + p3` do not correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:
- The program is partially correct but has a logical issue in the complex case handling. The condition and the final print statement need to be re-evaluated to ensure they correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To correctly handle the complex case, the logic should be revised to ensure that the remaining points are consistent with the rules of the game. Here is a corrected version of the complex case logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            max_draws = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
            # Ensure the remaining points are consistent
            if (p1 + p2 + p3 - max_draws * 2) % 2 == 0:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print(-1)
```

This revised logic ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly and that the remaining points are consistent with the rules of the game.
