Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30) representing the scores of three players. The function then prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it prints the sum of the other two scores. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that represents a balanced score distribution. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` provided for each test case remain unchanged, and the number of test cases `t` is also unchanged after the function concludes. **
