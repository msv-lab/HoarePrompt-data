Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The function first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either 2 for a win or 2 for a draw).

2. **Maximum Score Check**: If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `(p1 + p2)`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws can occur when the highest score is the sum of the other two scores, and all games end in draws. This condition ensures that the scores can be achieved with the maximum number of draws.

3. **Balanced Score Distribution**: If the above conditions are not met, the function attempts to find a balanced score distribution. It calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores (`p1` and `p2`). It then iterates to find a value `cur` such that the remaining scores after subtracting `cur` from `p1` and `p3 - cur` from `p2` are balanced. If such a value is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If no such value is found, it prints `p3`.

However, there is a logical issue in the balanced score distribution part. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):` is not correctly formulated to ensure the maximum number of draws. The correct approach should be to check if the remaining points can be distributed in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of the scores and maximizes the number of draws.

Let's correct the reasoning for the balanced score distribution:

- The total number of points is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- The number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
- The number of draws should be maximized, and the number of wins/losses should be minimized.

The correct approach is to calculate the maximum number of draws as follows:
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
- Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - (p3 - p1 - p2)`.

Given the provided execution summary, the function's logic for the balanced score distribution is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
