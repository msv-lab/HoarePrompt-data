Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.** 

In natural language: The program calculates the sum of `extroverts` and `universals`, divides this sum by 3, and then returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of this division. This means if the division results in a decimal, the program rounds up to the nearest whole number. If the division results in a whole number, it returns that whole number.
