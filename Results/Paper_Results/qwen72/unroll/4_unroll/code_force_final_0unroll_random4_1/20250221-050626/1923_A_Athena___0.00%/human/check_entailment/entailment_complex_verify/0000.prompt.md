You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t lists, where each inner list contains two elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the list `a` is trimmed to remove leading and trailing zeros, and the number of zeros in the trimmed list is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell. The function trims the list to remove leading and trailing zeros, then prints the trimmed list. It also calculates and prints the number of zeros in the trimmed list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, and the input lists for each test case are modified by removing leading and trailing zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips with free cells in between them. The program only counts the number of zeros in the trimmed array, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
```
The expected output is `3`, as you need to move the chips in the 3rd, 5th, and 7th positions to the left to form a single block. However, the program will output `4` because it counts all the zeros in the trimmed array, which is incorrect.
