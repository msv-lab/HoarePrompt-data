The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `test_cases` is a list of `t` lists, where each inner list contains two elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if there is at least one chip in the cells and returns a specific output based on the state of the cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of `t` test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the state of the cells in the corresponding test case.**
