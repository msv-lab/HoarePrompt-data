You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t lists, where each inner list contains two elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the list `a` is trimmed to remove leading and trailing zeros, and the number of zeros in the trimmed list is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program trims leading zeros from the list `a` using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also trims trailing zeros from the list `a` using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step is crucial because it effectively reduces the problem to the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips, ignoring the free cells at the beginning and end of the ribbon.

3. **Counting Zeros in the Trimmed List**:
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of zeros in the list `a` using a loop: `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1`.
   - The idea here is that the number of zeros in the trimmed list represents the number of free cells that need to be filled to form a single block of chips.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The program assumes that the number of zeros in the trimmed list is the minimum number of operations needed. This is not always correct.
  - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block. This can be done by finding the smallest number of moves to bring all chips to the leftmost or rightmost chip in the trimmed list.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of operations, we need to:
1. Identify the leftmost and rightmost chip positions in the trimmed list.
2. Calculate the number of moves required to bring all chips to the leftmost chip.
3. Calculate the number of moves required to bring all chips to the rightmost chip.
4. The minimum of these two values will be the answer.

### Example:
For the input `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`:
- After trimming, the list becomes `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- The leftmost chip is at index 0, and the rightmost chip is at index 5.
- To bring all chips to the leftmost chip, we need to move the chips at indices 3 and 4 to the left, which requires 2 moves.
- To bring all chips to the rightmost chip, we need to move the chips at indices 0, 1, and 2 to the right, which requires 3 moves.
- The minimum number of moves is 2.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations. It simply counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list, which is not the correct approach.
