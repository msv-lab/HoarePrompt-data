The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should process these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
