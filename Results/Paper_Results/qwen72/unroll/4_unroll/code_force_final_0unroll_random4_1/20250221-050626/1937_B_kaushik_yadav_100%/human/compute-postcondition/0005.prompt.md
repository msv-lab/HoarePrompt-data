You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should process these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        ans = ''
        
        i = 0
        
        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `counter` will have been reset or updated as necessary for each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be undefined as they are local to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function internally handles multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It returns the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid and the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
