### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, respectively.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each move. The function prints 'YES', which is correct.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. The function prints 'NO', which is correct.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to build the tower. This is because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for the tower to be built. The function prints 'Yes', which is correct.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), it is impossible to build the tower. The function prints 'No', which is correct.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the results in the correct format, either 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is very small or very large relative to `c`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
