The provided Python code snippet consists only of comments and does not alter any variables or state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
