Output State: **t is an input integer, n, k, and x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The initial constraints for `n`, `k`, `x`, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
