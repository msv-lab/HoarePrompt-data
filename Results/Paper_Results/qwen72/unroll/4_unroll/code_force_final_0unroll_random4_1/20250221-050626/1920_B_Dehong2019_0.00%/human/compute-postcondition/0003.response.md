Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` from input, sorts the list `a` in descending order, and calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` by applying the given transformations. The final value of `ans` for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and the values of `a_i` remain within the specified range.**
