Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.** 

The variable `c` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`a`, `x`, `ind`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
