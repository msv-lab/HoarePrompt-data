You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` unique integers, where `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. It returns an integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If no elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
2. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
3. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns `ind[0] - 1`.
4. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
5. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and the first element's index is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
6. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
7. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` remains unchanged, and the function's purpose is to find a specific index or distance based on the relative positions of the elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow k. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the optimal swap position for cow k to maximize its wins. It only checks for the first two cows with a higher rating and makes decisions based on their positions, which may not always lead to the correct maximum number of wins.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  10 15 12 13 14
  ```
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `0`

In this case, the optimal strategy would be to swap cow 3 (with rating 12) with cow 2 (with rating 15). This would result in the following sequence:
- After swap: `10, 12, 15, 13, 14`
- Matches:
  - Cow 1 (10) vs Cow 2 (12): Cow 2 wins.
  - Cow 2 (12) vs Cow 3 (15): Cow 3 wins.
  - Cow 3 (15) vs Cow 4 (13): Cow 3 wins.
  - Cow 3 (15) vs Cow 5 (14): Cow 3 wins.

Thus, cow 3 wins 1 match. However, the program incorrectly returns 0.
