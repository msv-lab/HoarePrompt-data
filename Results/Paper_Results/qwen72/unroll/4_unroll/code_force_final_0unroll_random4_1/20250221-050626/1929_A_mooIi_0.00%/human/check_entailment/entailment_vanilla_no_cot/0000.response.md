Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, sorts the array and prints the sorted array, which does not compute the maximum beauty.

To solve the problem correctly, you should:

1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        max_beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(max_beauty)
```

This program correctly sorts the array and computes the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
