To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Specifically, the loop will execute if the value is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9

The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
