To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- Each integer `a_i` in the inner list is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` is `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0 (as it is the loop variable and will be incremented with each iteration).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
