The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state, the only relevant adjustment is to ensure that the input value is at least 1, as this will ensure that the loop executes at least once.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
