The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the sizes of the lists and a specific constraint.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.

The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It processes `t` test cases, each with lists `a` and `b` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively, and an integer `k` that satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.**
