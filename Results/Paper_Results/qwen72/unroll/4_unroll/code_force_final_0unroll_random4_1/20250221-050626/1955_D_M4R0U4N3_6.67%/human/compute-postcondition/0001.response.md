Output State: **The variable `ans` contains the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` where at least `k` elements of the subarray are present in the set `todo` at the start of the subarray. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are modified during the loop execution, but their final states are not guaranteed to be predictable or meaningful outside the context of the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.**
