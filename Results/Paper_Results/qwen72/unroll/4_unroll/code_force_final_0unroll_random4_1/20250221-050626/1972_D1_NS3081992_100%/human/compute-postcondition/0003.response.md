To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.

1. **Condition 1: `i <= m`**
   - Given that `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, this condition is already satisfied because `i` is 1, which is the minimum value `m` can take.

2. **Condition 2: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - Given that `i` is 1, the condition simplifies to `1 * 1 <= n + 1`, which further simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, the condition `1 <= n + 1` is always true because the smallest value `n` can take is 1, making `n + 1` at least 2.

Since both conditions are satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0**
