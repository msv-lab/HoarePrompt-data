The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
