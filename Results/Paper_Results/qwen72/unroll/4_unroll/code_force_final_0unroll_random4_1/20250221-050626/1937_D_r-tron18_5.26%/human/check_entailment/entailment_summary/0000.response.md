### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length `n` when placed on each cell, given the grid's initial configuration of '<' and '>' characters.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character in the current cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific index derived from `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - It is used to compute the time taken for the pinball to move based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.

   - **func_2**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - It initializes two lists: `pre` for the positions of '>' characters and `preOne` for the cumulative sums of these positions.
     - It also initializes `suffZero` to keep track of the cumulative sums of the positions of '<' characters from the end of the string.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the `ans` list based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters and their cumulative sums.
     - The function prints the `ans` list, which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is correctly initialized to store the positions of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is correctly initialized to store the cumulative sums of these positions.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to store the cumulative sums of the positions of '<' characters from the end of the string.

   - **Iteration and Calculation**:
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, which is appropriate for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - For each cell, it correctly updates the `ans` list based on the positions and cumulative sums of '<' and '>' characters.
     - The conditions and calculations for updating `ans` are consistent with the problem's rules.

   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the `ans` list, which contains the correct time for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as strings with all '<' or all '>' characters correctly.
   - The function ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and calculations are consistent with the rules of the pinball movement and the grid configuration.

**Correctness: True**
