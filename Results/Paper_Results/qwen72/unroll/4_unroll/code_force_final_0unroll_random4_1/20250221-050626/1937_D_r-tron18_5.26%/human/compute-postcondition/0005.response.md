The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `n - 1` to ensure the loop begins correctly.

State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in s1 is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in s1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in pre up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length n with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
