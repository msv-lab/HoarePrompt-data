Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>>>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce incorrect results for this input.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid. The program uses a combination of prefix and suffix sums to determine the time, but it does not correctly account for the movement and inversion of the pinball in all cases. For the input `">>>"`, the pinball should move to the right and leave the grid in 1, 2, and 3 seconds respectively, but the program's logic for handling these movements and inversions is not robust enough to produce the correct results for all possible inputs.
