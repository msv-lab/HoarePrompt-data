You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

After the function concludes, the input list `arr` remains unchanged, and the function provides a numerical result representing this difference.

It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element `ans[i]` is determined based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `s1` remains unchanged, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, and `suffZero` is a list of length `n + 1` containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>>>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce incorrect results for this input.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid. The program uses a combination of prefix and suffix sums to determine the time, but it does not correctly account for the movement and inversion of the pinball in all cases. For the input `">>>"`, the pinball should move to the right and leave the grid in 1, 2, and 3 seconds respectively, but the program's logic for handling these movements and inversions is not robust enough to produce the correct results for all possible inputs.
