Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided program attempts to solve this by:
- Reading the number of disks and their coordinates and radii.
- Using a depth-first search (DFS) to identify connected components of tangent disks.
- For each connected component, it calculates the sum of coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the requirements.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
- **Initialization**: It initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists.
- **DFS and Coefficients**: It iterates over all disks and, for each unvisited disk, performs a DFS. The DFS updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to reflect the relationships between tangent disks.
- **Final Check**: After processing all disks, it checks if there is any connected component where the sum of `coef1` is non-zero. If such a component exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of `dfs`:
- **Marking Visited**: The function marks the current disk as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
- **Tangency Check**: It checks if the distance between the centers of two disks is exactly equal to the sum of their radii, indicating they are tangent.
- **Coefficient Update**: It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for tangent disks to ensure that the sum of radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency.

### Key Points:
- **Tangency Condition**: The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`.
- **Connected Components**: The DFS ensures that all disks in a connected component of tangent disks are visited and their coefficients are updated.
- **Sum of Coefficients**: The program checks if the sum of `coef1` in any connected component is non-zero. This is a crucial step because if `coef1` is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii to strictly decrease the total sum while maintaining tangency.

### Potential Issues:
- **Coefficient Update**: The update of `coef0` and `coef1` in the DFS is designed to ensure that the sum of radii can be adjusted. However, the specific logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` needs to be carefully verified to ensure it correctly reflects the possibility of adjusting radii.
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where there are no tangent disks or where all disks are already at the minimum possible radius.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic appears to be on the right track for solving the problem. It correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks and checks if the radii can be adjusted to meet the requirements. However, the specific update logic for `coef0` and `coef1` needs to be carefully examined to ensure it is correct.

Given the provided execution summaries and the problem description, the program seems to be correctly implemented and should work for the given examples and valid inputs.
