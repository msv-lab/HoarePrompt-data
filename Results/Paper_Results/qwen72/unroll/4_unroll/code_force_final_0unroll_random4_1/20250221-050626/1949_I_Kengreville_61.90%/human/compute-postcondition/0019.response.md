Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`. `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `nodes` is an empty list. If `ok` is `True`, at least one of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list. If `ok` is `False`, none of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list.***
