### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and the `nodes` list, which are necessary for the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is designed to explore the connected components of the graph formed by the disks. Each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two disks if they are tangent.
   - The function correctly marks disks as visited and appends their indices to the `nodes` list.
   - It calculates the distance between the centers of two disks and checks if they are tangent by comparing the squared distance with the squared sum of their radii.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated to ensure that the radii of tangent disks are adjusted in a way that maintains tangency.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs a DFS for each unvisited disk.
   - It calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the connected component of disks found by the DFS.
   - The program checks if `c1` (the sum of `coef1` values) is non-zero. If `c1` is non-zero, it means that the radii can be adjusted in a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `YES` if it finds at least one connected component where the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, indicating that the radii can be adjusted as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program uses a DFS to explore connected components of tangent disks.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to ensure that the radii adjustments maintain tangency.
- The key insight is that if the sum of `coef1` values for a connected component is non-zero, it is possible to adjust the radii in a way that the total sum of radii decreases.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the `coef0` and `coef1` values are correctly updated during the DFS. However, the initialization of `coef0` and `coef1` in the DFS function might be incorrect. Specifically, the line `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` might not be the correct way to update `coef0` for all cases.
- The program does not handle the case where the initial `coef0` and `coef1` values are not zero and one, respectively, which might be necessary for more complex scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issues with the coefficient updates, the overall logic of the program is correct in terms of identifying connected components and checking if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks to meet the given conditions. However, the coefficient updates might need to be reviewed for more complex scenarios, but the provided logic is sufficient for the problem's constraints.
