You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of disks. x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of booleans, where visited[i] is False if the i-th disk has not been visited, and True otherwise. nodes is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that have been visited. coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers or real numbers, where coef0[i] and coef1[i] are the coefficients used to adjust the radii of the disks.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: The loop will update the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the initially visited disk `i`. The `visited` list and `nodes` list will also be updated to reflect the new disks that have been visited and added to `nodes` through the `dfs` function calls. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.
    #State: *`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of disks. `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. If `visited[i]` is False, the `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated for all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the initially visited disk `i`. The `visited` list and `nodes` list are also updated to reflect the new disks that have been visited and added to `nodes` through the `dfs` function calls. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `visited[i]` is True, no changes are made to any of the lists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It modifies the `visited` list to mark the disk at index `i` as visited and adds the index `i` to the `nodes` list of visited nodes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
