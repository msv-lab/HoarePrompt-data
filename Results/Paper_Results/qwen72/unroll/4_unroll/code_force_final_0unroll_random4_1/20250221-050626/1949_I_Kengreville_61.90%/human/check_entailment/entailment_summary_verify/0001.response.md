### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of the number of disks \( n \) and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - The output is \(\texttt{YES}\) if it's possible to change the radii as described, otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each connected component, it calculates coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the criteria.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program initializes arrays for \( x \), \( y \), \( r \), \( \text{visited} \), \( \text{coef0} \), and \( \text{coef1} \).
     - It reads the input and stores the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - **DFS Function:**
     - The `dfs` function is used to explore all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
     - It sets the coefficients for each disk in the connected component.
   - **Main Function:**
     - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs DFS for each unvisited disk.
     - It calculates the sum of \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) for each connected component.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero for any connected component, it prints \(\texttt{YES}\), otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Tangency Condition:**
     - The program correctly identifies tangency by checking if the distance between the centers of two disks equals the sum of their radii.
   - **Connected Components:**
     - The DFS function correctly explores all disks that are part of the same connected component of tangency.
   - **Coefficient Calculation:**
     - The coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted.
     - The program sets \( \text{coef0}[i] = 0 \) and \( \text{coef1}[i] = 1 \) for the starting disk in each component.
     - For each disk \( j \) tangent to disk \( i \), it sets \( \text{coef0}[j] = r[i] + r[j] - \text{coef0}[i] \) and \( \text{coef1}[j] = -\text{coef1}[i] \).
   - **Sum of Coefficients:**
     - The program checks if the sum of \( \text{coef1} \) for any connected component is non-zero.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no disks (i.e., \( n = 1 \)) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where disks are not tangent to each other correctly by treating each disk as a separate component.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **DFS Function:**
  - The function `dfs` correctly marks the disk at index `i` as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
  - It then recursively visits all disks `j` that are tangent to the disk at index `i` and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists accordingly.
  - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that only disks that are exactly tangent are considered.

- **Main Function:**
  - The main function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary arrays and reads the input.
  - It iterates over all disks and performs DFS for each unvisited disk.
  - For each connected component, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1`.
  - If `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it prints \(\texttt{YES}\), otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables:**
  - The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used as global variables within the `dfs` function. This is generally not a good practice, but in this context, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Coefficient Calculation:**
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to ensure that the sum of radii can be adjusted. The logic of setting `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` is correct for maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii can decrease.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks to meet the given criteria. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program handles the problem as described.

Final: **True**
