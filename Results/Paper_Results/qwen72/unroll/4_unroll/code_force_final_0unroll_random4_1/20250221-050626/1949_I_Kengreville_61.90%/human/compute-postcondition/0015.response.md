Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` because at least one of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list.**
