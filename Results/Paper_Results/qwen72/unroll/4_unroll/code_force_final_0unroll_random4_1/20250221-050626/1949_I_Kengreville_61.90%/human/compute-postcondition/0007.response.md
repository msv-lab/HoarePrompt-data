Functionality: ** The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited in the `visited` list and adds the index `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the disk at index `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists. The function does not modify the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists. **
