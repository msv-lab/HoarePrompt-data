You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited in the `visited` list and adds the index `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the disk at index `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists. The function does not modify the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of the given disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of the number of disks \( n \) and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - The output is \(\texttt{YES}\) if it's possible to change the radii as described, otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each connected component, it calculates coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the criteria.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program initializes arrays for \( x \), \( y \), \( r \), \( \text{visited} \), \( \text{coef0} \), and \( \text{coef1} \).
     - It reads the input and stores the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - **DFS Function:**
     - The `dfs` function is used to explore all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
     - It sets the coefficients for each disk in the connected component.
   - **Main Function:**
     - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs DFS for each unvisited disk.
     - It calculates the sum of \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) for each connected component.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero for any connected component, it prints \(\texttt{YES}\), otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Tangency Condition:**
     - The program correctly identifies tangency by checking if the distance between the centers of two disks equals the sum of their radii.
   - **Connected Components:**
     - The DFS function correctly explores all disks that are part of the same connected component of tangency.
   - **Coefficient Calculation:**
     - The coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted.
     - The program sets \( \text{coef0}[i] = 0 \) and \( \text{coef1}[i] = 1 \) for the starting disk in each component.
     - For each disk \( j \) tangent to disk \( i \), it sets \( \text{coef0}[j] = r[i] + r[j] - \text{coef0}[i] \) and \( \text{coef1}[j] = -\text{coef1}[i] \).
   - **Sum of Coefficients:**
     - The program checks if the sum of \( \text{coef1} \) for any connected component is non-zero.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no disks (i.e., \( n = 1 \)) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where disks are not tangent to each other correctly by treating each disk as a separate component.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks to meet the given criteria. The logic and implementation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
