Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of disks. `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. If `visited[i]` is False, the `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated for all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the initially visited disk `i`. The `visited` list and `nodes` list are also updated to reflect the new disks that have been visited and added to `nodes` through the `dfs` function calls. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `visited[i]` is True, no changes are made to any of the lists.***
