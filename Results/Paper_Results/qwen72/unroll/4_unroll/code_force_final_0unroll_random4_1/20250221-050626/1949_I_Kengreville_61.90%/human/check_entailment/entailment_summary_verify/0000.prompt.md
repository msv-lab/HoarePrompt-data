You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited in the `visited` list and adds the index `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the disk at index `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists. The function does not modify the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that the sum of all radii must strictly decrease while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
3 0 1
6 0 1
```

In this case, the three disks are arranged in a line, each touching the next one. The program will likely treat these disks as part of the same connected component and attempt to assign coefficients to change their radii. However, the program does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. For example, if the program decides to increase the radius of the middle disk and decrease the radii of the other two disks, it might end up with a configuration where the sum of the radii does not decrease, or it might not find a valid configuration at all.

The program's logic for assigning coefficients and checking if the sum of radii can be decreased is not robust enough to handle all possible configurations of disks. Specifically, the `dfs` function and the way coefficients are assigned and checked do not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
