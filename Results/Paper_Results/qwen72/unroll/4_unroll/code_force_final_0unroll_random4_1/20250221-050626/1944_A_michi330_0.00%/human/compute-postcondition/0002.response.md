Output State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` change with each iteration based on the input provided, but the loop variable `i` will have completed its range from `0` to `t-1`. The final output state will be the sequence of printed values for each test case.
