Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
   - `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop.
   - `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `idx` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a` in each iteration.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `results` is a list that contains `t` elements. Each element in `results` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to a list `a` in each iteration of the loop.
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`), and then prints this string.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of `func_1` applied to a list `a`, the `print` statement will output each of these results, one per line.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the results of `func_1` applied to each list `a` in the loop, printed one per line.

Output: **Each result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a` in the loop, printed one per line.**
