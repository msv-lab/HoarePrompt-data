### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function takes an array `a` as input.
     - It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
     - It concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - It then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array) is equal to `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by performing the operation.
     - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
     - It initializes the index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
     - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The idea of concatenating the array with itself is correct because it allows us to check all possible rotations of the array.
   - The loop checks if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array.
   - If a match is found, it means that the array can be sorted by performing the operation, which is correct.
   - The logic of the function is sound and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - The results are printed in the correct format, one per line.
   - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

6. **Validation with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program at key points is as expected.
   - The state before and after the function calls, as well as the final state, are consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The concatenation and subarray check in `func_1` are correctly implemented and the results are correctly collected and printed in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. The concatenation and subarray check in `func_1` effectively determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
