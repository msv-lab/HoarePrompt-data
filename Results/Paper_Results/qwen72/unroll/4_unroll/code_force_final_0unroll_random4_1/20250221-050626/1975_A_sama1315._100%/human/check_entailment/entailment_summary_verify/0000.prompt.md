You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract `t` test cases, each containing `n` integers from a list `a`. It applies `func_1` to each list `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the last processed list, `a` is the last processed list of integers, `data` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is the index after processing all test cases, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).

### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Logic**: The function checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating a suffix and a prefix of the array. It does this by creating a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and then checking if any subarray of length `n` in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array.
- **Correctness**: This approach is correct because if there exists a way to split the array into two parts and swap them to get a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
- **Output**: The function collects the results of each test case and prints them in the required format.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The program handles a single test case correctly.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a subarray of `a + a`.
- **Array with Duplicates**: The program handles arrays with duplicate elements correctly.
- **Array with Unique Elements**: The program handles arrays with unique elements correctly.
- **Array of Length 2**: The program handles arrays of length 2 correctly, as the only possible split and swap will either leave the array unchanged or reverse it, which will be sorted if the original array was sorted.
- **Array of Maximum Length (50)**: The program handles the maximum length of the array (50) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and I cannot find a case where it fails. Therefore, the program is correct.
