### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. This means we need to check if there exists a way to split the array into two parts and swap them such that the resulting array is sorted.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any segment of the array concatenated with itself (`a + a`) contains a subsequence that matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach is valid because if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subsequence in `a + a`.
   - The function iterates through all possible starting points of the subsequence in `a + a` and checks if the subsequence of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result on a new line, which matches the required output format.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings, then processes each test case by extracting the necessary integers.
   - The output is correctly formatted as required by the problem statement, with each result printed on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already sorted, it will return 'Yes' because the sorted array is a subsequence of `a + a`.
   - If the array cannot be sorted by any prefix-suffix swap, the function will return 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps and handles the input and output as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
