The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50. It checks if any segment of the list `a` concatenated with itself (i.e., `a + a`) contains a subsequence that matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function always returns either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the condition described.
