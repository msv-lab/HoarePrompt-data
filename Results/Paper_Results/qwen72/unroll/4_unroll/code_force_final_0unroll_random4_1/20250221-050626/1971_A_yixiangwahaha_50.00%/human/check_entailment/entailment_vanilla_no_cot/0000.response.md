Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Fixed Number of Test Cases**: The program assumes there are always 10 test cases, but the problem description states that the number of test cases `t` can vary from 1 to 100. The program should read `t` and then loop `t` times, not always 10 times.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it in the loop. Instead, it hardcodes the loop to run 10 times, which is incorrect.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program uses `' '` (a space) to separate the two integers in the output. While this works, it is generally better to use a single space for consistency, which can be achieved by simply using a comma in the `print` function.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case accordingly. It also ensures that the output is formatted correctly.
