The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

However, if we assume that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each, the functionality could be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
