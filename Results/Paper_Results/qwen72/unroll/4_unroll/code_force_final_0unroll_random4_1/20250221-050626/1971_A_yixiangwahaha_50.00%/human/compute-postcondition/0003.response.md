The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range which is `10`. The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the values of `t`, `x`, and `y` because the range is fixed at 10. However, since the task specifies that we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute, and the loop will always execute 10 times given the range, we don't need to adjust `t`, `x`, or `y` to ensure the loop runs. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 up to 9, which is the default behavior of `range(10)`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for `t`, `x`, or `y` to ensure the loop executes. The only relevant state is that `i` is 0, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
