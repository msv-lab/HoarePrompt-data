Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) from user input. After reading the inputs, the function prints a pair of integers for each test case, ensuring that the first integer in the pair is always less than or equal to the second integer. The function does not return any value, and the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
