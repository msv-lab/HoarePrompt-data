The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is an input integer, it can be any integer, but for the loop to execute, it must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the last value of `s` has been printed.**
