Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. The lengths of the lists in `g` correspond to the degrees of the nodes in the tree. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1.**

The variable `l` is assigned the value 1. All other variables (`g`, `n`, `k`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
