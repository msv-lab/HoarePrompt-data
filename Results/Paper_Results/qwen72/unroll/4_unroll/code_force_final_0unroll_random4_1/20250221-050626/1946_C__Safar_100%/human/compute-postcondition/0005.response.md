Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. The lengths of the lists in `g` correspond to the degrees of the nodes in the tree. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`.**

The variable `r` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `k` using integer division. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
