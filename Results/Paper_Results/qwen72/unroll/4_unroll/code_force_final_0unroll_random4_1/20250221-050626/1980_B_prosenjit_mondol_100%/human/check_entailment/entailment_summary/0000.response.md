### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input, and then reads the list of cube values `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The index `f` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert it from a 1-based index to a 0-based index, which is consistent with Python's list indexing.
   - Similarly, `k` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert it from a 1-based index to a 0-based index.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the cubes are arranged from the largest value to the smallest value.

4. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored before sorting, using `x = a[f]`.

5. **Condition Checking**:
   - After sorting, the function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list `a[k]`.
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube will definitely be removed, so the function prints 'NO'.
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed, so the function prints 'YES'.
     - If `a[k] == x`, the function checks if the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list or if the value of the next cube `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`.
       - If either condition is true, the favorite cube will be removed, so the function prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, the favorite cube might or might not be removed, so the function prints 'MAYBE'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is equal to `n - 1` (the last cube in the sorted list).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or might be removed based on the given conditions. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
