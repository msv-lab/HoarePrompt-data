Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `edges`, or `start`. **
