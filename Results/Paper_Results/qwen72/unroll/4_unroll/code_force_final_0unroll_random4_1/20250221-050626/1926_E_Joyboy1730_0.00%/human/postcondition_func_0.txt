The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific number based on the values of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value, but it prints a result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k`. The list `L` remains empty, and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset to 0 and 1, respectively, for each test case.
