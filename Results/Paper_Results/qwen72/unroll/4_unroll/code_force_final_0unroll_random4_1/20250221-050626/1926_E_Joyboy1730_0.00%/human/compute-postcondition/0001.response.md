The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the loop depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
