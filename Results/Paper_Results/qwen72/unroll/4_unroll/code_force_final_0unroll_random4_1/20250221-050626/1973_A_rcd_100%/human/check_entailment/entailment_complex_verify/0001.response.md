### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because each game (whether it ends in a win or a draw) always results in an even number of points being distributed.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the sum is even, the program then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score player could have won all the games.
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score player could have won all the games and the other two players could have drawn all their games. This is correct.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively, and iterates while `y >= x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not true, it increments `x` and decrements `y` to adjust the number of draws and continues the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of the Loop Logic:
- The loop is designed to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the number of games played between the players. The idea is to balance the scores by distributing draws and wins.
- The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining points after `x` and `y` draws are consistent with the scores `p1` and `p2`.
- If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it means that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and the program prints `p3`.

### Edge Cases:
- **All scores are zero:** The program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
- **One draw:** The program correctly prints `1` for the case `0 1 1` because one draw could have occurred.
- **Invalid scores:** The program correctly prints `-1` for the case `1 1 1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with valid games.
- **Balanced scores:** The program correctly prints `2` for the case `1 1 2` and `6` for the case `3 4 5`.

### Additional Test Cases:
- **Case `1 1 10`:** The program prints `2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4` because:
  - If there were 4 draws, the scores would be `1 1 10` if the third player won all the non-draw games.
  - The program should print `4` instead of `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles most of the problem description and edge cases, but it fails to handle the case where the scores are `1 1 10`. The loop logic is flawed in this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
