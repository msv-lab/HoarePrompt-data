Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will take three integers p1, p2, and p3 as input. If the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, it will print -1. If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, it will print the sum of p1 and p2. Otherwise, it will print the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores of the players, which is either p1 - x + p3 or p3, depending on the conditions inside the loop. The values of p1, p2, and p3 will be re-assigned in each iteration, and the loop will continue until all t iterations are completed.**
