The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of three players after playing chess games, with the constraint 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function processes each test case and returns the results for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players. The function returns the results for each test case based on the scores provided.**
