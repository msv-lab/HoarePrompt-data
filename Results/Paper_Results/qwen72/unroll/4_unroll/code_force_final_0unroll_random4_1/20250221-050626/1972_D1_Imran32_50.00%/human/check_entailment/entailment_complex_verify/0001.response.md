### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) but does not use \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
   - The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\) plus 1, and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which is \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not use the variable \(m\) (read as `k`), which is essential for the problem.
   - The logic inside the function does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used to update `ans` does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This requires a more complex algorithm, possibly involving nested loops and the use of the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` is not implementing the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical flaws and the mismatch in the function's parameters.

Final: **False**
