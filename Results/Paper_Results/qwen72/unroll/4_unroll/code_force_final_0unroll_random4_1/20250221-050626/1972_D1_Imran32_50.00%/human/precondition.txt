The function `oacm` does not take any direct input arguments, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 × 10^6.
