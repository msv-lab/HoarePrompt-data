Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not handle the second condition at all. Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated calculations involving the square root of `n` and adding values to `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the problem requirements.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The expected output is 3, as the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program will output a different value because it is not correctly implementing the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
