To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand how it modifies the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    cnt = i * i
    ans += (n + i) // cnt
```

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, `cnt` is calculated as `i * i`.
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

### Calculation:
- `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- For each `i` in the range from 2 to `root`:
  - `cnt` is `i * i`.
  - `ans` is updated by adding the integer division result of `(n + i) // cnt`.

### Output State:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `root` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated by the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `root`.

### Example:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `k = 5`:
- `root = int(math.sqrt(10)) + 1 = 4`.
- The loop will iterate for `i` from 2 to 4.

#### Iteration 1:
- `i = 2`
- `cnt = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `ans += (10 + 2) // 4 = 12 // 4 = 3`
- `ans = 10 + 3 = 13`

#### Iteration 2:
- `i = 3`
- `cnt = 3 * 3 = 9`
- `ans += (10 + 3) // 9 = 13 // 9 = 1`
- `ans = 13 + 1 = 14`

#### Iteration 3:
- `i = 4`
- `cnt = 4 * 4 = 16`
- `ans += (10 + 4) // 16 = 14 // 16 = 0`
- `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains 10.
- `k` remains 5.
- `root` remains 4.
- `ans` is 14.

### General Output State:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `root` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `root` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.**
