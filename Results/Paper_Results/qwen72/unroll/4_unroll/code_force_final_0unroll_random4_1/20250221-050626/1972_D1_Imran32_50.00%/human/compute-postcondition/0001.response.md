Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. `ans` is equal to `n`.** 

The function takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. However, `k` is assigned the value of `m` instead of `m` being used directly. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `k` remains the second integer input, and `m` is not mentioned in the output state.
