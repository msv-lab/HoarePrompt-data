To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `root` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.

### Explanation:
1. **Variables and Their States:**
   - `n`: This is a variable whose value is known and remains unchanged.
   - `k`: This variable is mentioned but not used in the code snippet, so it is irrelevant for the calculation.
   - `root`: This is a variable whose value is known and remains unchanged.
   - `ans`: This variable is updated to a new value based on the formula provided.

2. **Formula for `ans`:**
   - The new value of `ans` is calculated as `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`.
   - This formula consists of two parts:
     - `n`: The unchanged value of `n`.
     - `sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`: This is a summation over a range from 2 to `root + 1` (inclusive). For each `i` in this range, the term `(n + i) // (i * i)` is calculated and added to the sum.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - For each `i` in the range from 2 to `root + 1`, the term `(n + i) // (i * i)` is computed.
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means the result is the floor of the division.
   - The sum of these terms is then added to `n`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after it has been updated according to the formula.

Since the exact values of `n` and `root` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1)) (where n is the value of n and root is the value of root)**
