### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.
   - The cost of an operation is the number of elements being assigned a new value.
   - The operation can be applied at most once.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.
   - It then uses two while loops to find the longest consecutive segments of equal elements at the beginning (`st`) and the end (`end`) of the array.
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adjusts `ans` to be the length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`, ensuring `ans` is non-negative.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - If the array is already all the same, the cost should be 0. The program handles this by checking if the first and last elements are the same and adjusting `ans` accordingly.
     - If the array has only one element, the cost should be 0. The program handles this by the initial while loops, which will not change `ans` in this case.
   - **General Case:**
     - The program correctly identifies the longest segments of equal elements at the beginning and the end.
     - The cost is calculated by subtracting the length of the longest segment from the total length of the array.
     - If the first and last elements are the same, it further optimizes the cost by considering the sum of the lengths of the segments at the beginning and the end.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` and at the end is `[1]`. The cost is `6 - max(1, 1) = 4`.
   - For the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the array is already all the same, so the cost is `0`.
   - For the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[8, 8, 8]` and at the end is `[8, 8, 8]`. The cost is `8 - max(3, 3) = 2`.
   - For the array `[1]`, the cost is `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - For the array `[1, 2]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` and at the end is `[2]`. The cost is `2 - max(1, 1) = 1`.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` and at the end is `[3]`. The cost is `3 - max(1, 1) = 2`.
   - For the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[4]` and at the end is `[3]`. The cost is `7 - max(1, 1) = 6`.
   - For the array `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the longest segment at the beginning is `[9, 9]` and at the end is `[3]`. The cost is `9 - max(2, 1) = 7`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal for each test case. It handles edge cases and general cases appropriately.
