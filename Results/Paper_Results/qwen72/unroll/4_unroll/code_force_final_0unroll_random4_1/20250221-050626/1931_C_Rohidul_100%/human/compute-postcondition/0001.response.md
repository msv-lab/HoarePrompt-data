Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the value of `ans`, which is the length of the array `a` minus the maximum of the lengths of the longest consecutive segments of equal elements at the beginning (`st`) and the end (`end`) of the array. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, `ans` is adjusted to be the length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`, ensuring `ans` is non-negative. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop, but `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are reset for each test case.**
