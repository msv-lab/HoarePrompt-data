The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. For the loop to execute, the range function must be called with a positive integer. This integer is provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases, `t`.

- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop by the `for` loop mechanism.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This means `t` is always a positive integer, which ensures that `int(input())` will be a positive integer, allowing the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0, which is already guaranteed by the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0 (automatically set by the loop)**
