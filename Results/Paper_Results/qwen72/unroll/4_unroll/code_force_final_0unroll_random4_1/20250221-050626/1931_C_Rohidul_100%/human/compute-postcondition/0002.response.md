The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. Specifically, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
