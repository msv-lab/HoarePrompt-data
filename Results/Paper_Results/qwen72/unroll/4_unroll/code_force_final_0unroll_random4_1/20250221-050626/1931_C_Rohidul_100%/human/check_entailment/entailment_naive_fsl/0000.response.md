Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has a single unique value that is different from the values at the edges. For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The program will output `3`, but the correct answer should be `1` because we can make all elements equal by setting `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which costs only 2 burles. The program incorrectly assumes that the optimal solution always involves the edges of the array, which is not always the case.
