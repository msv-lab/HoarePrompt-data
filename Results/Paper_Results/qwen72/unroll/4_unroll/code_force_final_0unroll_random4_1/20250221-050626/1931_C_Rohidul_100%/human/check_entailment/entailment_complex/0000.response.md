### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Identifying Consecutive Segments:**
   - The function initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes two counters, `st` and `end`, to 1, which will track the lengths of the longest consecutive segments of equal elements at the beginning and end of the array.
   - The function then moves the `l` pointer to the right as long as the current element and the next element are the same, incrementing `st` accordingly.
   - Similarly, it moves the `r` pointer to the left as long as the current element and the previous element are the same, incrementing `end` accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as the length of the array `le` minus the maximum of `st` and `end`. This represents the cost of setting the middle part of the array to a value that is different from the values at the beginning and end.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function adjusts `ans` to be the length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`. This ensures that the cost is minimized by setting the middle part to the value of the first and last elements.
   - The function ensures that `ans` is non-negative by using `max(0, ...)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly identifies the longest segments of equal elements at the beginning and end of the array.
- The cost calculation is based on the idea of minimizing the length of the subarray that needs to be set to a common value.
- The special case where the first and last elements are the same is handled correctly by adjusting the cost to account for the combined length of the segments at the beginning and end.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:** The function correctly handles this by setting `ans` to 0, as no operation is needed.
- **Array with All Elements Equal:** The function correctly handles this by setting `ans` to 0, as no operation is needed.
- **Array with No Consecutive Equal Elements:** The function correctly handles this by setting `ans` to the length of the array minus 1, as the entire array needs to be set to a single value.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
