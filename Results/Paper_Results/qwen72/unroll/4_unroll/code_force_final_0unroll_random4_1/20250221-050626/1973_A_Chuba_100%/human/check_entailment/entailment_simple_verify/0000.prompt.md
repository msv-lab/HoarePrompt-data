You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers from the input, checks if their sum is odd, and if so, prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result based on the formula provided and prints the result. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula `result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of draws.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. If `v[2]` (the highest score) is more than the sum of the other two scores, it means there are more points than can be explained by the number of games played, and the program adjusts the total score accordingly.
   - The division by 2 is necessary because each draw results in 2 points being distributed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If all scores are 0, the program correctly prints `0` (no draws).
   - **One Game Drawn**: If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` (one draw).
   - **Inconsistent Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **All Draws**: If the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Mixed Wins and Draws**: If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` (the maximum number of draws).

The program handles all the given examples and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
