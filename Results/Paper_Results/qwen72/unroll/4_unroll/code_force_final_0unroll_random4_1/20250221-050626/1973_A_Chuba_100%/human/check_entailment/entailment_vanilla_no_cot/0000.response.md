Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Score Validity Check**: The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/lose scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of draws.
   - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points scored by all three players.
   - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is non-negative. This difference represents the points that could not have been part of a draw.
   - Subtracting this difference from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
