The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to work within a context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these parameters.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, we can infer that the parameters might be passed in a different way, such as through global variables or as part of a larger context (e.g., a test suite or another function that calls `func`).

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not defined.**
