Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an input integer.**
