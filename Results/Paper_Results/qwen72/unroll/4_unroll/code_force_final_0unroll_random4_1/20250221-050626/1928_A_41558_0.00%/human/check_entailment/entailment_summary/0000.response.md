Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
- For Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even, because an even dimension can be split into two equal or unequal parts, allowing the formation of a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.
- If both dimensions are odd, no cut can result in a different rectangle, as the resulting parts will always be odd and thus cannot form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.
- The program correctly checks if both `a` and `b` are odd and prints 'NO' if they are, which is correct.
- However, the program also prints 'NO' if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`). This condition is incorrect because it is possible to form a different rectangle in such cases. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original but rotated. However, a 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.
- The program should only print 'NO' if both dimensions are odd. If at least one dimension is even, it should print 'YES' because a different rectangle can always be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it incorrectly rejects cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other.

Correctness: **False**
