Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list where each segment of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter) is filled with a unique integer starting from 1, and `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 (where `arr` is a list with each segment of length `k` filled with a unique integer starting from 1, and the last segment may be shorter)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: [0, 0, ..., 0] (where the list contains `n` zeros)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (where the number of zeros is equal to `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n, inclusive. It divides the integer `n` into `ceil(n / k)` segments, each of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter), and fills each segment in the list `arr` with a unique integer starting from 1. The function prints the list `arr` where each segment is filled as described, the number of segments `cliques`, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, and clique is a positive integer.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The array `arr` has been updated such that the elements from index `left + mid - mid` (which is `left`) to `left + mid - 1` are set to the values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`. The array `cliquess` has been updated such that the elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The array `arr` has been updated such that the elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to the values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to the values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`. The array `cliquess` has been updated such that the elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`, and the elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are also all set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function updates two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, in place. After the function concludes, the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `right` are set such that the first half of the range (from `left` to `left + mid - 1`) contains values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) contains values from `right + 1 - not_mid` to `right + 1`. The elements of `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.
