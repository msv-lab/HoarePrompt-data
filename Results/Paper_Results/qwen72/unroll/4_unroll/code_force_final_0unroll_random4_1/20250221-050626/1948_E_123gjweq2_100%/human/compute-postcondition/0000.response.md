Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `small_element`, which is assigned the value of `left + 1`. Therefore, `small_element` is now one more than the value of `left`.
