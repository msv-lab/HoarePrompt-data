### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it divides the vertices into segments of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter).
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the segments of `arr` and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function is responsible for filling the segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate values.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` to determine the range of values to be assigned.
   - It splits the segment into two halves, `mid` and `not_mid`, and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - The first half of the segment is filled with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the second half is filled with values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.
   - Both halves are assigned the same `clique` value in `cliquess`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.
   - The values in `arr` should be distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the values in `cliquess` should indicate the partition of the graph into cliques.

4. **Edge Condition**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge condition where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, ensuring that all vertices are in the same clique.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is less than `n`, ensuring that the vertices are partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `2 3`, the program should output:
     ```
     2 1
     1
     1 1
     ```
     This is correct because with `k = 3`, the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and the graph can be partitioned into a single clique.
   - For the input `5 4`, the program should output:
     ```
     3 1 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 2 1 2
     ```
     This is correct because the vertices are partitioned into two cliques, and the edge condition is satisfied within each clique.
   - For the input `8 16`, the program should output:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
     1
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     This is correct because with `k = 16`, the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and the graph can be partitioned into a single clique.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly assigns distinct integers to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. The logic and the output match the problem requirements for the provided examples.
