Output State: **The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The array `arr` has been updated such that the elements from index `left + mid - mid` (which is `left`) to `left + mid - 1` are set to the values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`. The array `cliquess` has been updated such that the elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`.**
