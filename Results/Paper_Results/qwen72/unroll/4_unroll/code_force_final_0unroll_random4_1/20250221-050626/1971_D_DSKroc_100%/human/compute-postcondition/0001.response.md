The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `s` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `q` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
