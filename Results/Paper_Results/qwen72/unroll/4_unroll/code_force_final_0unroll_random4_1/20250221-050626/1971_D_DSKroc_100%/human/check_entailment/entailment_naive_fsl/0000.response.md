Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's), the output should be 1, as no cuts are needed. However, the program incorrectly increments the count by 1 in such cases.

For example, consider the input string "00000000". The program should output 1, but it outputs 2 because it increments the count by 1 at the end regardless of whether the string is already sorted or not. This is due to the line `print(count + 1)` which is always executed, even when the string is already sorted.

To fix this, the program should output `1` if the string is already sorted, and `count + 1` otherwise.
