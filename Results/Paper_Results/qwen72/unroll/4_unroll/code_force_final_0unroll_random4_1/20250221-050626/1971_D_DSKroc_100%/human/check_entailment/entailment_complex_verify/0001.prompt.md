You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `s` is the last binary string input (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each input string `s`, it has printed the number of adjacent character changes, with an additional 1 added if there are no increases in value between adjacent characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each of the `t` binary strings `s` provided as input, it calculates and prints the number of adjacent character changes in the string. If there are no increases in value between adjacent characters in the string, it prints the count of changes plus one. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a given binary string can be divided into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `flag` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is different from the next character `s[i + 1]`, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is less than the next character `s[i + 1]` (i.e., '0' followed by '1'), it sets `flag` to 1.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is still 0, it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

3. **Identifying the Logic:**
   - The `count` variable is used to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1' or '1' and '0'.
   - The `flag` variable is used to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`flag` remains 0), the string is already sorted, and we need `count + 1` pieces (since `count` counts the number of cuts, and we need one more piece to account for the entire string).
   - If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' (`flag` is 1), the string is not sorted, and we need `count` pieces (since the last piece will naturally include the remaining characters).

4. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of transitions between different characters.
   - However, the logic for determining the number of pieces is flawed. If the string is already sorted, it should print 1. If the string is not sorted, it should print the number of transitions plus one (since each transition requires a cut, and we need one more piece for the last segment).

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - If the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' after '1'), the answer is 1.
   - If the string is not sorted, the answer is the number of transitions plus one.

6. **Correcting the Program:**
   - The program should print `count + 1` if `flag` is 1, and 1 if `flag` is 0.

### Correctness:
The provided program is **incorrect** because it prints `count + 1` when the string is already sorted and `count` when the string is not sorted. The correct logic should be the opposite.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(count + 1)
```

Correctness: **False**
