Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each of the `t` binary strings `s` provided as input, it calculates and prints the number of adjacent character changes in the string. If there are no increases in value between adjacent characters in the string, it prints the count of changes plus one. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
