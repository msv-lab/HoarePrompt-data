Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation \(p\) is maximized. The solution uses a series of queries to the interactor to determine the maximum XOR value without directly accessing the permutation \(p\).

### Function Analysis:
1. **`func_1(a, b, c, d)`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor with four indices \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).
   - It prints the query in the format `? a b c d` and flushes the output.
   - It then reads the response from the interactor, which is one of `<`, `=`, or `>`.
   - The function returns this response as a string.

2. **`func_2(n)`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - It starts by initializing `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - After finding the maximum element, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates over all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
       - If the result of this comparison is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Finding the Maximum Element**:
  - The first loop in `func_2` is designed to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation \(p\). This is done by comparing \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). Since \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), this effectively finds the maximum element in the permutation.
  - This part is correct and ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum element in \(p\).

- **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
  - The second loop in `func_2` is designed to find the index `pair_idx` such that \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \oplus p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) is maximized.
  - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) for all \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
  - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} < p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\), it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
  - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} = p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\), it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure that \(p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) is the maximum possible value.
  - This part is also correct and ensures that `pair_idx` is the index of the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum possible XOR value.

- **Query Count**:
  - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
  - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
  - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2n-1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and uses the queries efficiently to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The logic and the number of queries are both within the constraints specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
