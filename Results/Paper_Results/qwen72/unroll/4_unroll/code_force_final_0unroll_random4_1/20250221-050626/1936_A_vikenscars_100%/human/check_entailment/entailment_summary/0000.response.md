Reasoning:

The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` in a permutation `p` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to interact with the judge to achieve this goal.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Functionality**: `func_1` sends a query to the judge and receives a response indicating whether `(p_a | p_b) < (p_c | p_d)`, `(p_a | p_b) > (p_c | p_d)`, or `(p_a | p_b) = (p_c | p_d)`.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly formats the query and reads the response from the judge. It ensures that the input parameters are not modified and returns the judge's response as a string. This function is essential for the interaction and is implemented correctly.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Functionality**: `func_2` is responsible for finding the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` such that `p[max_item_idx] ⊕ p[pair_idx]` is maximized.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Finding `max_item_idx`**:
     - The function iterates over all indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p[max_item_idx] | p[max_item_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`.
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`. This step ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the element in `p` with the highest value (since `p[i] | p[i]` is just `p[i]`).
  2. **Finding `pair_idx`**:
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It then iterates over all indices from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])`.
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the response is `=`, it further compares `(p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])` and updates `pair_idx` to `i` if the response is `>`. This step ensures that `pair_idx` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `p[max_item_idx]`, gives the maximum value.
  3. **Output**:
     - The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

### Query Count:
- **Finding `max_item_idx`**: This step uses `n-1` queries.
- **Finding `pair_idx`**: This step uses `n` queries.
- **Total Queries**: The total number of queries is `2n - 1`, which is within the limit of `3n` queries.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` such that `p[max_item_idx] ⊕ p[pair_idx]` is maximized.
- The query count is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.
- The function handles the interaction with the judge correctly and ensures that the output format is as required.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Correctness: **True**
