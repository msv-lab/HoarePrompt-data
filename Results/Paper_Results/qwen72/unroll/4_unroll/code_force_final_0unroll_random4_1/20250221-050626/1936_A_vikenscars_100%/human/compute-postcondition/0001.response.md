The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already given to be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, this condition is already satisfied. However, the loop head initializes `i` to 1, so we need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1**
