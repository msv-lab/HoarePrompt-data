You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, two lists `a` and `b` of integers, and prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The variable `ans` contains the list of absolute differences for the last test case, and `temp` is an integer that indicates the index where the algorithm decided to switch the pairing strategy, or -1 if no switch was needed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` using a specific pairing strategy. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each one, printing the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` is undefined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The variable `ans` contains the list of absolute differences for the last test case, and `temp` is an integer that indicates the index where the algorithm decided to switch the pairing strategy, or -1 if no switch was needed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order and then truncated to the first `m` elements (though `m` is always at least `n`, so this step doesn't change the length of `b`).

3. **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It also initializes a variable `temp` to -1, which will be used to track the point where the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` becomes larger than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **First Loop:**
   - The program iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - If the difference with `b[-(n - i)]` is greater, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` to `ans`.

5. **Second Loop:**
   - If `temp` is not -1, it means there was a point where the difference with `b[-(n - i)]` was greater.
   - The program then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program aims to maximize the total difference `D` by choosing the largest possible differences.
  - By sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, the program ensures that the largest elements of `b` are paired with the smallest elements of `a` and vice versa.
  - The first loop checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the largest remaining element of `b`) is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the smallest remaining element of `b`).
  - If such a point is found, the program switches to using the largest elements of `b` for the remaining elements of `a`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as the elements in `a` (e.g., the second test case).
  - It also handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (e.g., the third test case).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting steps are efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\).
  - The loops run in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. It handles the input and output as specified and uses an efficient approach to find the maximum difference.

### Correctness:
**True**
