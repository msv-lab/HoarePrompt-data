### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order and then truncated to the first `m` elements (though `m` is always at least `n`, so this step doesn't change the length of `b`).

3. **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It also initializes a variable `temp` to -1, which will be used to track the point where the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` becomes larger than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **First Loop:**
   - The program iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - If the difference with `b[-(n - i)]` is greater, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` to `ans`.

5. **Second Loop:**
   - If `temp` is not -1, it means there was a point where the difference with `b[-(n - i)]` was greater.
   - The program then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program aims to maximize the total difference `D` by choosing the largest possible differences.
  - By sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, the program ensures that the largest elements of `b` are paired with the smallest elements of `a` and vice versa.
  - The first loop checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the largest remaining element of `b`) is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the smallest remaining element of `b`).
  - If such a point is found, the program switches to using the largest elements of `b` for the remaining elements of `a`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as the elements in `a` (e.g., the second test case).
  - It also handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (e.g., the third test case).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting steps are efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\).
  - The loops run in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. It handles the input and output as specified and uses an efficient approach to find the maximum difference.

### Correctness:
**True**
