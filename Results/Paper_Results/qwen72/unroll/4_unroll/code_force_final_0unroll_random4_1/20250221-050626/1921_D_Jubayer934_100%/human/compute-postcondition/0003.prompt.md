You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
        
    #State: The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, two lists `a` and `b` of integers, and prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The variable `ans` contains the list of absolute differences for the last test case, and `temp` is an integer that indicates the index where the algorithm decided to switch the pairing strategy, or -1 if no switch was needed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the processing of these lists and integers. If `t` is the number of test cases, the function will return `t` results. Each result is determined by the relationship between the elements of `a_i` and `b_i`, and the constraints on `n` and `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
