The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is automatically managed by the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, the key is to ensure that the input value is valid for the loop to execute. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is already constrained to be between 1 and 100, which means the input value should be within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be at least 1 and at most 100**
