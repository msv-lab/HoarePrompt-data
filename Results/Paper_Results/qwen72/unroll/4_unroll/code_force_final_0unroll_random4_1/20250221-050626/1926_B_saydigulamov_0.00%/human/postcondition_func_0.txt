The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of rows in a grid, followed by `n` lines of input, each containing a string of characters '0' or '1'. If any of these grids contain exactly two rows with the same number of '1's, it prints a list of the counts of '1's in those rows. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is unchanged except for the side effect of printing the results to the console.
