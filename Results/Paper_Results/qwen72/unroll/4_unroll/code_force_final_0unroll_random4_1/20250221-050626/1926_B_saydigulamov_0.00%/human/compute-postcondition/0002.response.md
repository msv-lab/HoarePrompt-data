Output State: **The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input representing a grid. If any of these grids contain exactly two rows with the same number of '1's, it prints a list of the counts of '1's in those rows. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.**
