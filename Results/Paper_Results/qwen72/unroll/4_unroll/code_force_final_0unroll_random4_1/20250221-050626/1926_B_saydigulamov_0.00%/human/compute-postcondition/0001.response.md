To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The initial state provided includes details about the grid and the number of test cases, but these are not directly relevant to the loop head. However, the variable `a` is mentioned as an input integer, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
