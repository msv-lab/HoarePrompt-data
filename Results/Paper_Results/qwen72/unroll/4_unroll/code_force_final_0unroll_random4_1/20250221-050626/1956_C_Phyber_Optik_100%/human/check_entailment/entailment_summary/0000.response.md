Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are either assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum, which is \( n^3 \) for an \( n \times n \) matrix.

The program calculates the sum as follows:
- It initializes the sum to 1.
- For each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), it adds \( (i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1)) \times i \) to the sum.

The formula \( (i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1)) \times i \) simplifies to \( (2i - 1) \times i \), which is \( 2i^2 - i \). Summing this from \( i = 2 \) to \( n \) should give the correct total sum, but it is not the most straightforward way to calculate \( n^3 \).

The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) in each row and column is:
\[ \text{Sum} = n \times \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \right) = n \times \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, the program's sum calculation is not correct for \( n > 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), the sum is correctly calculated as 1, but for larger \( n \), the sum is incorrect. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the correct sum is \( 2 \times \left( \frac{2 \times 3}{2} \right) = 6 \), but the program calculates it as 7.

Additionally, the program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is the upper limit allowed, but it does not ensure that the matrix is filled correctly to achieve the maximum sum. The operations it prints are:
- For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints a Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
- For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints a Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

These operations will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) in each row and column, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

Given the incorrect sum calculation, the program is not correct.
