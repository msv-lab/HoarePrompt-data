### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum is set to 1.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, and for each `i`, it adds `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the sum.
   - This formula simplifies to `i * (2 * i - 1)`, which is the sum of the first `i` integers squared minus the sum of the first `i-1` integers squared, multiplied by `i`. This is correct for calculating the sum of the matrix elements after performing the operations.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines:
     - The first line is a Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - The second line is a Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Operation Validity:**
   - The operations are valid as they use permutations of integers from 1 to `n` and apply them to rows and columns within the allowed range.
   - The number of operations is `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Matrix Sum Maximization:**
   - The operations ensure that each element of the matrix is set to the maximum possible value, which is `n` for each element.
   - The sum of all elements in the matrix after these operations is `n * n * n`, which is the maximum possible sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with the maximum value `n`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the sum is correctly calculated as 1, and a single operation is performed.
   - For larger `n`, the sum and operations are calculated and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, performs the required operations, and outputs the correct sum and operations for each test case. The operations are valid and within the allowed limit, and the sum is maximized as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
