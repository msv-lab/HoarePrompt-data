The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input, and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5. The function returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the size of the matrix `n`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with a single integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the size of the matrix `n`.**
