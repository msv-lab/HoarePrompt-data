The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that can be matched to characters in `b` in the same order and prints this count. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed count of matched characters.
