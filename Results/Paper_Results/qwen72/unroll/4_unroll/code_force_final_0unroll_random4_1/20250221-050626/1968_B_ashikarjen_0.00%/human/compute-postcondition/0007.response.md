To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order.
   - `j` is the index of the last matched character in `b` plus 1.

2. **Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are strings.
   - `k` is an integer representing the count of matching characters in the same order in `a` and `b`.
   - `j` is an integer representing the index of the last matched character in `b` plus 1.

3. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order. This means that if `a` and `b` are compared character by character, `k` will be the count of positions where the characters are the same.

4. **Understanding `j`:**
   - `j` is the index of the last matched character in `b` plus 1. This means that if the last matched character in `b` is at index `i`, then `j = i + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order)**
