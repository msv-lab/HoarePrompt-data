The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the constraints on `n` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
