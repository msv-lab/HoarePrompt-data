Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 500. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500) from the input. It then calculates the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and prints this sum along with `2 * n`. Additionally, for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line is "1 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line is "2 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, but the specified output has been printed for each test case. **
