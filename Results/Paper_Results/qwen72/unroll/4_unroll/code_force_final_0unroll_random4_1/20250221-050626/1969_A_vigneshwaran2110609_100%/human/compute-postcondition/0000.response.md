Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct.**

The value of `n` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must be within the range 2 to 50 (inclusive). The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
