You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:

    #State: The loop iterates through each integer from 0 to n-1. For each iteration, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if for any index `i` in the range 0 to `x-1`, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds true. If the condition is met, it prints 2 and sets a flag to True, breaking out of the inner loop. If the condition is never met, it prints 3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers. It then checks if for any index `i` in the range 0 to `x-1`, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds true. If the condition is met, it prints 2 and breaks out of the inner loop. If the condition is never met, it prints 3. The function does not return any value and does not modify any input parameters or global variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of best friends.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It then iterates over the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` checks if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend themselves. This is a valid check to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2` because both friends in the pair will come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This is based on the assumption that if there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is `3`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where there are more than one pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, since the problem specifies that we need at least 2 friends to come to the party, finding any one pair is sufficient to print `2`.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of cycles or chains of friends. For example, if `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, this forms a cycle, and the program will print `3` instead of `2` (since any 2 friends in the cycle can be invited to ensure they both come).

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases.
   - However, it fails to handle cycles or chains of friends, which can also be used to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party with fewer than 3 invitations.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle all possible scenarios, particularly cycles or chains of friends.

Correctness: **False**
