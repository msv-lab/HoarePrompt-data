Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct subsequences of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing sequence to reach `n` distinct subsequences. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
