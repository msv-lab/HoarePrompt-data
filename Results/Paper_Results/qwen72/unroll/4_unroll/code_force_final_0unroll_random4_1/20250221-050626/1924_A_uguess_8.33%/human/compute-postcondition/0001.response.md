The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` should be 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
