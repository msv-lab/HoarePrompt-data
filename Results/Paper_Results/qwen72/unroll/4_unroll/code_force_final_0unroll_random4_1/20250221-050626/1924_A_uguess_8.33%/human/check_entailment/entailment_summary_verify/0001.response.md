### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with different values of `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which is used to count the number of times a valid subsequence of length `n` is found.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is used as a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
     - Checks if the character is not already in the current subsequence using the bitmask `cur`.
     - If the character is not in the current subsequence, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the character.
     - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been included in the current subsequence. It increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
     - If `cnt < n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets.
       - It finds the first character that is not in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`.
       - It appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence when `cnt < n`.
   - The logic for constructing `ans` is flawed:
     - It appends `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets, which is not necessarily the correct approach.
     - It finds the first character that is not in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
     - It appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`, which is also not a correct approach to ensure the string does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print "NO" and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print "YES".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
