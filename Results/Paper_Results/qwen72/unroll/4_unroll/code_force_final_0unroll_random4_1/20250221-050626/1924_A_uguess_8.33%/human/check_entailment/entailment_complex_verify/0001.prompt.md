You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has either printed 'YES' if the string s contains at least n distinct subsequences of the first k alphabets, or 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing sequence to reach n distinct subsequences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct subsequences of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing sequence to reach `n` distinct subsequences. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with different values of `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which is used to count the number of times a valid subsequence of length `n` is found.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is used as a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
     - Checks if the character is not already in the current subsequence using the bitmask `cur`.
     - If the character is not in the current subsequence, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the character.
     - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been included in the current subsequence. It increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
     - If `cnt < n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets.
       - It finds the first character that is not in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`.
       - It appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence when `cnt < n`.
   - The logic for constructing `ans` is flawed:
     - It appends `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets, which is not necessarily the correct approach.
     - It finds the first character that is not in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
     - It appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`, which is also not a correct approach to ensure the string does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print "NO" and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print "YES".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is incorrect.
