You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = input()
        
        e = input()

    #State: t remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m remain integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, a is an integer input, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. The loop prints the value of k for each iteration of the outer loop, where k is the index in the string d up to which the characters of d can be found in e in the same order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The function then processes these strings to find the index `k` in string `d` up to which the characters of `d` can be found in `e` in the same order. It prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` remain integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. The input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are consumed and no longer available.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the prefix of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b` but the index `k` is not updated correctly. Specifically, the program updates `k` incorrectly when the last character of `a` is found in `b`. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
10011
11011
```
The expected output is `5` because the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly updates `k` when the last character of `a` is found in `b`.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
if k == c or j == b - 1:
    k = j + 1
    break
```
This condition should be:
```python
if j == b - 1:
    k = j + 1
    break
```
Additionally, the line:
```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
```
should be:
```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + k
```
to correctly update the index `k` without adding an extra `1`.
