Output State: **The function `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The variable `I` is now a function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.**
