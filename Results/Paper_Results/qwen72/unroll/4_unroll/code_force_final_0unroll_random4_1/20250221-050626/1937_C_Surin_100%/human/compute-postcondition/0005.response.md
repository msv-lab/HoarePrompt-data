Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to determine and output the indices of the maximum and second maximum values in a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the function makes at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. After processing each test case, the function outputs two integers, `prev` and `v1`, which are the indices of the maximum and second maximum values in the permutation, respectively, in the format `! prev v1`. The function processes all test cases and completes its execution. **
