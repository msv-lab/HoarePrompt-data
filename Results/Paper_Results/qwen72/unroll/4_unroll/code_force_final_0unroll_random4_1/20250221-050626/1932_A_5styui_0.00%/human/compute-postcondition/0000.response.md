Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, the list of tuples is unchanged.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of an input integer. The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, and the list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of `n` characters ('.', '@', '*'), remains unchanged. The first character of each string in the tuples is still always '.'.
