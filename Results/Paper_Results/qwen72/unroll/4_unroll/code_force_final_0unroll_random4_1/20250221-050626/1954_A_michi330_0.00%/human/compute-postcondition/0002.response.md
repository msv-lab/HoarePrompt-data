Output State: **The loop has finished executing `t` times, and for each test case, the output is either 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are input values and are not modified within the loop.**
