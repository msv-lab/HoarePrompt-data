Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color is less than `k`. This is calculated by `n - math.ceil(n / m)`, which represents the minimum number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color. If this number is less than `k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the answer is `Yes`.

3. **Output**: The program prints `NO` or `Yes` based on the conditions, which matches the required output format.

The program handles all edge cases and correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
