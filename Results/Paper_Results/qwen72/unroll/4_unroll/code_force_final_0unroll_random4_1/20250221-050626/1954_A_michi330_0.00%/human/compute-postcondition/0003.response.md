The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= m, k <= n <= 50`.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 to 1000, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of test cases is invalid.
- Case_2: For each valid test case, if `m` and `k` are both less than or equal to `n` and within the range 1 to 50, the function processes the test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= m, k <= n <= 50`. If `t` is outside the range 1 to 1000, it returns an error message. For each valid test case, it processes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and returns a result based on these values.**
