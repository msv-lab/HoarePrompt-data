The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `tests` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20` and the strings consist of lowercase Latin letters). The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. If at least one character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
