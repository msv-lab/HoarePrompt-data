You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `tests` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20` and the strings consist of lowercase Latin letters). The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. If at least one character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to properly check if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The program only checks if there is at least one character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

Counterexample:
```
Input:
1
3
abc
abd
aac

Output:
NO

Expected Output:
YES
```

In this example, the strings `a` and `b` are "abc" and "abd" respectively, and `c` is "aac". A valid template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` is "AaC". The program, however, incorrectly prints "NO" because it only checks if there is a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, which is not the correct logic for determining if a template exists.
