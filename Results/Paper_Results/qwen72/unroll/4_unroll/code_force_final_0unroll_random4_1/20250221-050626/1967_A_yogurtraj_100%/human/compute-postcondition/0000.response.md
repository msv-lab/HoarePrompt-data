The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ii` and the result of the `int(input())` expression, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the problem description states that `t` (the number of test cases) is at least 1, we can assume that `int(input())` will be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `ii` is 0.

State: **`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
