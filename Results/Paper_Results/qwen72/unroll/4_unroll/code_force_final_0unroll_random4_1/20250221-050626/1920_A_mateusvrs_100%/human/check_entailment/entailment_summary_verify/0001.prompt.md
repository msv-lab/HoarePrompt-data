You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers (a, x) from the input, where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x) and `x` is the value for the constraint. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case. The function prints a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of valid integers `k` that meet the constraints for the corresponding test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the function prints 0 for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints, `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a small value (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` using `max` and `min` functions, respectively.
  - This ensures that `bx` is the smallest value that `k` can be, and `ax` is the largest value that `k` can be.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly adds the values that `k` must not be to the set `cx`.
  - It then checks if these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of such values from the total range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `bx` is greater than `ax` by appending `0` to the result list, which is correct because no integer can satisfy such constraints.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints by simply calculating the range `[bx, ax]`.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the results for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
