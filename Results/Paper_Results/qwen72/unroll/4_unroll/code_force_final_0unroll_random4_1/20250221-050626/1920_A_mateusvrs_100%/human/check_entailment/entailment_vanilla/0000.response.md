### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints, `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a small value (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` using `max` and `min` functions, respectively.
  - This ensures that `bx` is the smallest value that `k` can be, and `ax` is the largest value that `k` can be.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly adds the values that `k` must not be to the set `cx`.
  - It then checks if these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of such values from the total range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `bx` is greater than `ax` by appending `0` to the result list, which is correct because no integer can satisfy such constraints.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints by simply calculating the range `[bx, ax]`.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the results for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
