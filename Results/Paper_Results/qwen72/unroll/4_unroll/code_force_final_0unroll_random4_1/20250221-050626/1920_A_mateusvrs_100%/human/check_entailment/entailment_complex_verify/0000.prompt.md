You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a=1 indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 indicates k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: `r` is a list containing `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [r[0]]
    #[r[1]]
    #...
    #[r[t-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers (a, x) from the input, where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x) and `x` is the value for the constraint. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case. The function prints a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of valid integers `k` that meet the constraints for the corresponding test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the function prints 0 for that test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works for all potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number and `bx` to a very small number to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`.
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and the value `x` if the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
   - It updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and the value `x` if the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - It adds the value `x` to the set `cx` if the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x).
3. **Validation**:
   - If `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the upper bound), it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.
4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the range of valid integers and accounts for the "not equal" constraints by removing them from the count. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
