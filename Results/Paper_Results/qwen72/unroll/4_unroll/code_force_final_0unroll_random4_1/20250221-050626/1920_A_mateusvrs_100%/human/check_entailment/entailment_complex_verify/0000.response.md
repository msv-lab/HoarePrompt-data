Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers `k` that satisfy a set of constraints. Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`.

2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000007`), which will serve as the upper bound for `k`.
     - `bx` is initialized to a very small number (`-1`), which will serve as the lower bound for `k`.
     - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - **Updating Bounds**:
     - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), `bx` is updated to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), `ax` is updated to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the upper bound). If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - `ax` is set to a very large number to ensure it starts as the maximum possible upper bound.
  - `bx` is set to a very small number to ensure it starts as the minimum possible lower bound.
  - `cx` is an empty set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

- **Updating Bounds**:
  - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), `bx` is updated to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound.
  - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), `ax` is updated to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound.
  - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), `x` is added to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be equal to are stored.

- **Validation**:
  - If `bx > ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so the program correctly appends `0` to the result list `r`.
  - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by computing `ax - bx + 1` (the total number of integers in the range) and subtracting the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.

### Edge Cases:
- **No Valid Range**:
  - If the constraints are such that `bx > ax`, the program correctly returns `0`.
- **Single Valid Range**:
  - If the constraints are such that `bx` and `ax` are valid and there are no type 3 constraints, the program correctly returns the range size.
- **Multiple Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple type 3 constraints by subtracting the number of invalid values from the range size.

### Example Verification:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Constraints: `k >= 3`, `k <= 10`, `k != 1`, `k != 5`
  - `bx = 3`, `ax = 10`
  - Valid range: 3 to 10 (inclusive)
  - Invalid values: 1, 5
  - Valid integers: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (7 integers)
  - Output: 7

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Constraints: `k >= 5`, `k <= 4`
  - `bx = 5`, `ax = 4`
  - No valid range (5 > 4)
  - Output: 0

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Constraints: `k >= 2`, `k <= 100`, `k != 6`, `k != 7`, `k != 100`, `k != 98`, `k != 3`, `k != 99`
  - `bx = 2`, `ax = 100`
  - Valid range: 2 to 100 (inclusive)
  - Invalid values: 6, 7, 100, 98, 3, 99
  - Valid integers: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, ..., 97 (90 integers)
  - Output: 90

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints, calculates the valid range, and accounts for the "not equal" constraints. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
