You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a=1 indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 indicates k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: `r` is a list containing `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [r[0]]
    #[r[1]]
    #...
    #[r[t-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. The constraints are pairs of integers (a, x) where a indicates the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x) and x is the value for the constraint. The function returns a list of integers, each representing a value of k that satisfies all constraints for each test case. If no such k exists for a test case, it returns -1 for that test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
