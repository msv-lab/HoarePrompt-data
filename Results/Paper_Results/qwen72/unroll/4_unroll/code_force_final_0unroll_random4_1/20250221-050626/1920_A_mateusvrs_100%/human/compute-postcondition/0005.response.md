Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. The constraints are pairs of integers (a, x) where a indicates the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x) and x is the value for the constraint. The function returns a list of integers, each representing a value of k that satisfies all constraints for each test case. If no such k exists for a test case, it returns -1 for that test case.**
