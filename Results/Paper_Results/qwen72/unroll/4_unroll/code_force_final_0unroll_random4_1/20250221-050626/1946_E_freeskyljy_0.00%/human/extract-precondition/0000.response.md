Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be defined with parameters `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices`. The parameters should satisfy: `n` is a positive integer, `m_1` and `m_2` are positive integers such that `1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n`, `prefix_max_indices` is a list of `m_1` integers in strictly increasing order where `1 <= p_i <= n`, and `suffix_max_indices` is a list of `m_2` integers in strictly increasing order where `1 <= s_i <= n`.**
