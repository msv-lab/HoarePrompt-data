### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is suitable for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `n`, and the rest are the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (the list of water amounts in each container).
   - It first calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(a)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant and will never fail.
   - The target amount of water in each container is calculated as `total_water // n`.
   - The function uses a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount.
   - For each container, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the water cannot be redistributed as required, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and parses it into the required format.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the target amount of water for each container.
   - The logic of the function is based on the observation that if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount ever becomes negative, it is impossible to redistribute the water as required.
   - This logic is correct because if `container` becomes negative, it means that at some point, more water has been poured out than can be poured back in, making it impossible to balance the containers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
