You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that we can always pour water from a container with more than the target amount to a container with less than the target amount, while maintaining the condition `i < j`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water for each container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `container` between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and there is no way to pour water from a container with more water to this container without violating the `i < j` condition.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means it is possible to achieve the target amount of water in all containers.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers.
   - The first integer `n` is the number of test cases.
   - The subsequent integers are the amounts of water in the containers for the test cases.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly determines if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water for a single test case.
   - However, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually.
