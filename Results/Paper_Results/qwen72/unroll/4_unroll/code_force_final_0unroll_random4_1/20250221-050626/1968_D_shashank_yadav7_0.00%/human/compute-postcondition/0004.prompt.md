You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take the following parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` (integers for each test case representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), `p` (a list of integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of integers representing the array). The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after the inner loop completes. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`, and `sp` will be modified within each test case but will be reset for the next test case. After all iterations, the final values of these variables will be the state after the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the outcome of the game for each test case, where `n` is the length of the permutation, `k` is the duration of the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `p` is a list representing the permutation, and `a` is a list representing the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
