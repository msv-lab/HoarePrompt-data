Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after the inner loop completes. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`, and `sp` will be modified within each test case but will be reset for the next test case. After all iterations, the final values of these variables will be the state after the last test case.**
