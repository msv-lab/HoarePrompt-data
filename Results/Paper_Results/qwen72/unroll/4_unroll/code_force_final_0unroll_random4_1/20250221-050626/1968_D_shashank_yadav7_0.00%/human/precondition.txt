t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, P_B and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, p is a permutation of length n with elements 1 to n, and a is an array of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
