Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take the following parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` (integers for each test case representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), `p` (a list of integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of integers representing the array). The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `t` is now an integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
