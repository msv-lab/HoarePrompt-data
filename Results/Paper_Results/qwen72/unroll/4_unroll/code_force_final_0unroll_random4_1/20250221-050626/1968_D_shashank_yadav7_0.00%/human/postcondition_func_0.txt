The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements and the values in the array `a`. The function then prints the outcome of the game for each test case, which can be 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on the comparison of their final scores. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is the state after the last test case, with the results printed for each test case.
