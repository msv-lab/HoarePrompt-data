### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Adjusting Positions:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-indexed positions, which is necessary because Python lists are 0-indexed.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the values at their current positions in the array `a`.

5. **Score Maximization:**
   - The program attempts to maximize the scores by using a complex formula involving `max` and `k`. However, this formula seems unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach should be to simply add the values at the current positions for each turn, without trying to maximize the scores using the `max` function.

6. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Score Maximization Formula:** The use of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is incorrect and unnecessary. The scores should be updated by simply adding the values at the current positions.
- **Redundant Operations:** The program subtracts 1 from `k` in each iteration, which is not needed. The loop should run exactly `k` times.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score calculation and unnecessary operations.
- The corrected program follows the correct logic and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
