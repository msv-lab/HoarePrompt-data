Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines where `bm` and `sm` are updated are incorrect:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

These lines are not following the rules of the game as described. According to the problem description, the score for each player should be updated by adding the value at the current position in the array `a` to their score, and then the player either stays at the current position or moves to the position specified by the permutation `p`. The program should not be multiplying the score by `k` or adding `bp` and `sp` in the way it does.

A correct implementation would involve updating the scores by adding the value at the current position and then moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`. The program should also handle the case where the player stays at the same position if `p[x] == x`.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            
            if p[b] - 1 == b:
                b = p[b] - 1
            else:
                b = p[b] - 1
            
            if p[s] - 1 == s:
                s = p[s] - 1
            else:
                s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This corrected version correctly updates the scores and handles the movement based on the permutation `p`. The original program does not follow the game rules and thus is incorrect.
