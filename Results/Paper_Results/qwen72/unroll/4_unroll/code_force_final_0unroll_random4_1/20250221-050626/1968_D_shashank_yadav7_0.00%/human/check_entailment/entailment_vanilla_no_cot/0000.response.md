Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. The logic used in the loop to update `bm` and `sm` is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines are not necessary and do not follow the rules of the game. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position, and the player should either stay or move to the next position based on the permutation.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates `k` times, but the `k` value is decremented inside the loop. This can lead to incorrect behavior, especially when `k` is large. The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, and the `k` value should not be modified inside the loop.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect. The positions should be updated using `p[b]` and `p[s]` directly, as the positions are 0-indexed in the code.

4. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `sp` and `bp` are used but are not necessary for the solution. They are not used correctly in the score calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Convert positions to 0-indexed
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        score_b = 0
        score_s = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            score_b += a[b]
            score_s += a[s]
            
            # Decide whether to stay or move
            if a[p[b] - 1] > a[b]:
                b = p[b] - 1
            if a[p[s] - 1] > a[s]:
                s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if score_b > score_s:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_b < score_s:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game by:
- Converting the starting positions to 0-indexed.
- Initializing the scores for both players.
- Iterating `k` times to simulate each turn.
- Updating the scores based on the current position and deciding whether to stay or move to the next position based on the permutation and the array values.
- Determining the winner based on the final scores.
