Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility that the grid can be made uniform even if the first and last rows or the first and last columns do not match. The logic in the program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BWW
WBB
WWB
```
The program will output "NO" for this grid because the first and last rows do not match, and the first and last columns do not match. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color with the following operations:
1. Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) black.
2. Select (1, 2) and (2, 3) to color the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (2, 3) white.
3. Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) again to color the entire grid black.

Thus, the correct output for this case should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
