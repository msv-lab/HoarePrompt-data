Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case describes a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each test case, it checks if the first row is entirely one color ('W' or 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column. If either of these conditions is met, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and their values do not persist between test cases. **
