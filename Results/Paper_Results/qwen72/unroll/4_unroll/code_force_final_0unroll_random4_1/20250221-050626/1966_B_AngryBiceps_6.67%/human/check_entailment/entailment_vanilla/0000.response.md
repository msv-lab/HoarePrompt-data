### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Grid Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `a`.

2. **First and Last Row Analysis:**
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` contains the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` contains the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for Impossibility:**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if it is impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - **Condition 1:** If the first row is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and the first row is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`), it prints "NO".
     - **Condition 2:** If the first column (represented by `first_row`) is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and the first column is different from the last column (`first_row != last_row`), it prints "NO".

4. **Conditions for Possibility:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1:**
  - If the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row, it means that the first row is already uniform but the last row is not. This makes it impossible to change the last row to match the first row using the given operations, as the operations can only change a subrectangle to a single color if the selected squares are the same color.
  - This condition correctly identifies a scenario where the grid cannot be made uniform.

- **Condition 2:**
  - If the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column, it means that the first column is already uniform but the last column is not. This makes it impossible to change the last column to match the first column using the given operations, for the same reason as Condition 1.
  - This condition also correctly identifies a scenario where the grid cannot be made uniform.

- **General Case:**
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program assumes that it is possible to make the grid uniform. This is a valid assumption because:
    - If the first row and the last row are not entirely one color, or if the first column and the last column are not entirely one color, there is always a way to select two squares of the same color and perform operations to eventually make the entire grid uniform.
    - The operations can be used to propagate the color from the edges towards the center of the grid, ensuring that all squares can be made the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the grid uniform and prints "NO" in those cases. It also correctly prints "YES" in all other cases, which are valid for making the grid uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
