### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses helper functions to read input efficiently. `func_1` reads a line and strips it, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits and maps it to integers. These functions are well-designed and handle the input as described in the problem.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Handling Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - This logic is correct because it considers both directions when `c` is '?' and only the specified direction when `c` is '0' or '1'.

4. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set to adjust for 1-based indexing. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and the modulo operation can result in `0`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players. This matches the required output format.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets to track possible positions ensures that duplicates are avoided, which is efficient and necessary for the problem.
  - The program handles the constraints (1 \le t \le 10^4, 2 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le m \le 1000) efficiently.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '0' or '1' by only considering the specified direction.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', considering both directions.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` (which is represented as `0` in modulo operations).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The logic for handling each throw, the adjustment for 1-based indexing, and the output format are all implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
