### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and process the input efficiently.
   - The main function `func_4` correctly reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - The logic for handling each throw is correct:
     - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions in `temp`.

3. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing:**
   - The program correctly handles 1-based indexing by checking if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and the modulo operation can result in `0`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players, which matches the problem description.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization:**
  - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the initial player `x`.

- **Throw Processing:**
  - The program correctly processes each throw by considering both possible directions when `c` is '?'.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are tracked without duplicates.
  - The modulo operation is correctly used to wrap around the circle of players.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '0' or '1' by only considering the specified direction.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', considering both directions.
  - The program correctly handles the transition from `0` to `n` to adjust for 1-based indexing.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of possible players and then the sorted list of player numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The original assessment was accurate in its evaluation of the program's correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
