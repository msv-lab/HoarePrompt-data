### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` which represent the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player with the ball, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c` for the throw.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the initial player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to the contents of `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because player numbers are 1-indexed, and `0` would represent player `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans` and then prints the players themselves in increasing order.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative number, which is not handled correctly. In Python, `(q - r) % n` will always return a non-negative result, but it might not be the correct player number. For example, if `q = 1` and `r = 2`, `(1 - 2) % 5` results in `4`, which is correct, but `(1 - 2) % 3` results in `2`, which is incorrect. The correct way to handle this is to use `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the result is always non-negative and within the range of player numbers.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The set operations are correctly implemented to account for both possible directions when `c` is '?'. However, the modulo operation needs to be adjusted as mentioned above.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `0` is in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the modulo operation for the counterclockwise direction. The correct way to handle the counterclockwise direction is to use `(q - r + n) % n` instead of `(q - r) % n`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right before the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right before the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right before the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split part into an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right before the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n - 1) % n + 1)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` and `(q - r + n - 1) % n + 1` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans is the set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r - 1) % n + 1 and (q - r + n - 1) % n + 1 for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: [values in ans] (where ans is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations (q + r - 1) % n + 1 and (q - r + n - 1) % n + 1 for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times, and the values are sorted in increasing order)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has a minor issue with the modulo operation for the counterclockwise direction. The corrected code above addresses this issue and should be considered correct.
