To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is excluded from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.

2. **Understanding the Operations**:
   - The operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are performed for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
   - These operations generate new values that are added to the set `ans`.
   - The set `ans` will contain unique values due to the nature of sets in Python.

3. **Handling `0` in `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - This means that `ans` will either contain `0` or `n`, but not both.

4. **Final State of `ans`**:
   - The final state of `ans` depends on the initial set and the values returned by `func_1()`.
   - The number of unique values in `ans` will be the length of the set.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after the operations and the conditional modification.

Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the length of the set `ans` after all the described modifications. Since the exact initial set and the values returned by `func_1()` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the operations and the conditional modification.

Output: **len(ans) (where ans is the set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times, with 0 excluded and n added if 0 is present)**
