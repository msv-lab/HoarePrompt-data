Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on three integer variables `n`, `m`, and `x` (where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n) that are obtained from the function `func_3`. The function generates a set `ans` of all possible values derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`. The function then prints the number of unique values in `ans` and the values themselves. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
