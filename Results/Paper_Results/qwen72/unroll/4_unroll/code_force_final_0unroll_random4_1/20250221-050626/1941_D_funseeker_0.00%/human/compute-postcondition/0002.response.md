The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n`, `x`, and `ans` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0**
