Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times. If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is excluded from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.***
