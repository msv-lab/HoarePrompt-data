Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are now the values returned by `func_3()`.** 

Explanation: The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` after the execution depend on what `func_3()` returns, but they will still satisfy the initial conditions: 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
