### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is used to read the input for each test case.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`, and then processes `m` lines of input for the throws.

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after the throw:
     - If `c` is '0' (clockwise), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set.
     - If `c` is '1' (counterclockwise), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set.
     - If `c` is '?', it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of the modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the function checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be interpreted as `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of unique players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the players' numbers in increasing order.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for updating the set `ans` based on the direction of the throw is correct.
- The edge case where `0` is in the set is handled correctly by replacing it with `n`.
- The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of possible players and their numbers in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
