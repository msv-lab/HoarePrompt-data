Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it in a single loop. It splits the input into a list of strings and uses an index to track the position of the current element being processed. This approach is efficient for large inputs as described in the problem constraints.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `pf`. This is a crucial step because the prefix XOR allows for quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. This is done correctly in the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       a[i] = int(data[index])
       index += 1
       pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
       mp[pf[i]].append(i)
   ```

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero. If the XOR is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts where each part's XOR is zero, which satisfies the condition for being "interesting." This is correctly handled by:
   ```python
   x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
   if x == 0:
       results.append('YES')
       continue
   ```

4. **Finding Valid Splits**: If the XOR is not zero, the program uses the `defaultdict` `mp` to store indices where the prefix XOR is the same. It then checks if there are valid indices to split the subarray into parts where the XOR of each part is the same. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices:
   ```python
   v1 = mp[pf[r]]
   v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
   it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
   it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
   if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
       results.append('YES')
   else:
       results.append('NO')
   ```

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results of all queries at the end of the function using:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the subarray XOR is zero and when the subarray cannot be split into valid parts with the same XOR.

7. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that it can handle up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) elements in the array and up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) queries.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
