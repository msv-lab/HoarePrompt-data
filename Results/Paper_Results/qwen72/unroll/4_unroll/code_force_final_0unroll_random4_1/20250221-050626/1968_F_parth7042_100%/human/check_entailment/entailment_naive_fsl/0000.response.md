Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it checks if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the condition `(v1[it1] < v2[it2])` is not sufficient to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. This condition only checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that can form a valid split, but it does not ensure that the XOR of the segments is equal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
```
For the query `(1, 5)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly handle the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is non-zero and cannot be split into equal XOR segments.

The correct approach would involve checking if the XOR of the subarray can be zeroed out by splitting it into segments with equal XOR values, which the current program does not do accurately.
