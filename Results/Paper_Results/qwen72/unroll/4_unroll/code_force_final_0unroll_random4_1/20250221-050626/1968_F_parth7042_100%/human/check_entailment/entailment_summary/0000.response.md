Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1` reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input using an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - The number of test cases `t` is correctly read and the loop runs `t` times.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The function initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` and a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly computed by iterating through the array `a` and updating `pf[i]` as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs, which helps in quickly checking if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the function computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values (each part having XOR 0), so the function appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the function checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array where the XOR value `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` can be found such that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - The function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

4. **Binary Search and Conditions**:
   - The binary search is used to find the first index in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the last index in `v2` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - The conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` ensure that the indices are valid.
   - The condition `(v1[it1] < v2[it2])` checks if there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` where the XOR values match.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are collected in the `results` list and printed at the end of the function.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by checking the conditions and appending 'NO' to the results.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the function can handle large inputs efficiently, as required by the problem constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
