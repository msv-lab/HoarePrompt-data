t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case contains n and q, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is represented by two integers l and r, where 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
