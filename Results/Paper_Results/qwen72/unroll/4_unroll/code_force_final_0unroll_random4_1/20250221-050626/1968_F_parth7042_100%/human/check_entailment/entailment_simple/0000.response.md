### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle large inputs.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the input and generate the results. However, the initial call to `func_1()` should be corrected to `func_1()` with no arguments since the function definition does not take any parameters.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` and a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - For each element in the array `a`, it updates the prefix XOR `pf` and appends the current index to the list in `mp` corresponding to the current prefix XOR value.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array `pf`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is 0, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - If the XOR is not 0, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR dictionary `mp` that can form a valid partition. Specifically, it checks if there is an index `i` such that `l <= i < r` and `pf[i] == pf[r]` and an index `j` such that `l <= j < r` and `pf[j] == pf[l-1]`.
   - If such indices exist and they can form a valid partition, the program appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and processes the input as described in the problem statement.
- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated, and the dictionary `mp` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.
- **Query Processing**: The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. The program checks if the XOR of the subarray is 0, which is a valid condition for an interesting subarray. If the XOR is not 0, it correctly checks for the existence of valid indices in the prefix XOR dictionary to form a partition.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
