The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, which starts at 0 and increments with each iteration. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be an integer greater than 0, and `_` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
