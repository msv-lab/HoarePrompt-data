The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function should also handle the input of the number of test cases `t`. The parameters and their constraints are as follows:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `h` and `w` are integers where 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9.
- Additionally, either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b` must hold true.
- The sum of `h` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters. However, the specific return values or conditions for these results are not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters, ensuring that the constraints on `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are met.**
