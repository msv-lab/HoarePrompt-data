Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read six integers from the input, perform the specified conditions, and print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions. After all iterations, the value of `t` will be unchanged, and the input variables for each test case (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) will be consumed and not retained. The output will be a series of strings, each either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', corresponding to the result of each test case.**
