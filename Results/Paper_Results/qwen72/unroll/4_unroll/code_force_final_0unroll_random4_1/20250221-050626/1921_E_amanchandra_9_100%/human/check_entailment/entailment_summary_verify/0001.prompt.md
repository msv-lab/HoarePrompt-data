You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. The function then determines and prints the result of a game for each test case, which can be either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The result is based on the relative positions of `a` and `c`, and the distances between `b`, `d`, and the calculated values `l` and `r`. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any of the input values, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that the input for each test case has been consumed, and the corresponding results have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `r` (height) and `w` (width), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The program first checks if Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this is the case, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - If Alice's chip is not initially below Bob's chip, the program calculates the vertical distance `x` between the two chips as `abs(a - c) // 2`. This is because each player can move one row closer to each other in one turn, so the number of turns required for them to meet is half the vertical distance.

4. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the vertical distance `abs(a - c)` is odd, the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice's chip can potentially meet Bob's chip after `x` turns.
   - It then checks if Alice's chip can move to a column within this range in the next turn (`abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`). If so, Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

5. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the vertical distance `abs(a - c)` is even, the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob's chip can potentially meet Alice's chip after `x` turns.
   - It then checks if Bob's chip can move to a column within this range in the next turn (`abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`). If so, Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Odd Distance:**
  - The logic for the odd distance case is correct. Alice can move to any of the three possible positions in her turn, and if she can move to a column within the range where Bob's chip will be after `x` turns, she wins. Otherwise, the game is a draw.

- **Even Distance:**
  - The logic for the even distance case is also correct. Bob can move to any of the three possible positions in his turn, and if he can move to a column within the range where Alice's chip will be after `x` turns, he wins. Otherwise, the game is a draw.

### Potential Issues:

- **Column Range Calculation:**
  - The column range calculation for both odd and even cases is correct. The use of `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` ensures that the range stays within the board boundaries.

- **Win Condition:**
  - The win condition for both Alice and Bob is correctly implemented. The program checks if the chips can meet within the calculated range and the number of turns.

- **Draw Condition:**
  - The draw condition is correctly handled. If the chips cannot meet within the calculated range and the number of turns, the game is a draw.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions and the rules provided.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
