#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a_1, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        dic = dict()
        
        ans = 0
        
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if i in dic:
                dic[i] -= 1
                if dic[i] == 0:
                    del dic[i]
            else:
                if s not in dic:
                    dic[s] = 0
                dic[s] += 1

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. `times` is an input integer that has been decremented to 0. For each iteration, `n` was an integer read from input, and `data` was a list of integers read from input. `dic` is a dictionary that contains the counts of the XOR results of the elements in `data` with `check` (2^31 - 1). `ans` is the number of unique XOR results that were added to `dic` during each iteration. The final value of `ans` is printed for each iteration. The value of `check` remains 2147483647.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). It then processes the list to count the number of unique XOR results of each element in `a` with the value `2^31 - 1`. The function prints the count of these unique XOR results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the value of `check` remains `2147483647`.
