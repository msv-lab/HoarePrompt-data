The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be assigned values from 0 to `times - 1` as the loop iterates. The other variables mentioned in the state (t, n, a_1, ..., a_n, check) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `times` must be greater than 0.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
