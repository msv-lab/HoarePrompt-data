Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). It then processes the list to count the number of unique XOR results of each element in `a` with the value `2^31 - 1`. The function prints the count of these unique XOR results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the value of `check` remains `2147483647`. **
