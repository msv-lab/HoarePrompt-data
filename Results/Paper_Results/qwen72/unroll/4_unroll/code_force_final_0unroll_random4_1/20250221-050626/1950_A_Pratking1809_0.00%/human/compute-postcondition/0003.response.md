Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, q is an input integer, mn is 100.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `q` times, and within each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and prints one of the strings 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions. However, the loop does not modify the values of `t`, `q`, or `mn`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reset with each iteration from new input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `q`, and `mn` remain unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are still digits within the specified range after the loop completes.
