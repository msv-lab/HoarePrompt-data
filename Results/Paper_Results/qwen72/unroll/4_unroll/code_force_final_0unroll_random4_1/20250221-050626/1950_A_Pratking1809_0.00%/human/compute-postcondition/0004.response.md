The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on or with some external input or state that includes an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, digits `a`, `b`, and `c` where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result that is dependent on these inputs, but the specific output is not described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer `t` and digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 <= t <= 1000 and 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. It returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
