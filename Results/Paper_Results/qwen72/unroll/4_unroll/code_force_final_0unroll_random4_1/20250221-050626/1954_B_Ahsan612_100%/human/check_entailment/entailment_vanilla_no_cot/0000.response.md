Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it processes the array and determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the `num` and `i` variables, which can lead to skipping elements or incorrect comparisons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize variables
        minn = float('inf')
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        # If the minimum segment length is 1 or the entire array is a segment, it's impossible to make it not beautiful
        if minn == 1 or minn == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn - 1)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if all elements are the same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so we output `-1`.
2. **Initialize variables**: `minn` is set to infinity to keep track of the minimum segment length, `same` is set to 1 to count the length of the current segment, and `num` is set to the first element of the array.
3. **Iterate through the array**: For each element, if it is the same as the previous element, increment `same`. If it is different, update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, reset `same` to 1, and update `num` to the current element.
4. **Final check**: After the loop, update `minn` one last time with the length of the last segment. If `minn` is 1 or equal to the length of the array, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, so output `-1`. Otherwise, output `minn - 1` because removing one element from the smallest segment will prevent the array from being beautiful.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
