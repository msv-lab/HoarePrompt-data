Output State: **The loop iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it processes the list `ar` to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number that are not the entire list. If no such segment exists or the entire list is a single segment, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, while the loop variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset or updated for each test case.**
