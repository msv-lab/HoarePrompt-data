### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can have all elements the same or can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number that are not the entire array.
   - If the entire array is a single segment or no such segment exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.

3. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly updates the `num` and `i` variables, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - Specifically, the line `i += 1` inside the `else` block is problematic because it increments `i` twice in some cases, leading to skipping elements.

4. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `1` instead of `3`.
   - The program incorrectly identifies the minimum segment length as `1` because it skips elements due to the double increment of `i`.

5. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The correct approach should be to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number that are not the entire array.
   - The program should not skip elements and should correctly identify the minimum segment length.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but does not consist of identical elements.
- The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some test cases.

Final: **False**
