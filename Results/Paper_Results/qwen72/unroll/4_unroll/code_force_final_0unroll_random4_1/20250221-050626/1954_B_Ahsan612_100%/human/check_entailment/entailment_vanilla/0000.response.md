### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity) to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the array.
   - It checks if the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the last element in the current sequence of consecutive elements).
   - If they are equal, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If they are not equal, it moves to the next element, updates `num` to the new element, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - The `same` counter is reset to 1 for the new sequence.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - It then checks if `minn` is still `inf` or if it is equal to the length of the array `n`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints `-1` (indicating it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies sequences of consecutive elements that are the same.
  - It updates `minn` to the minimum length of these sequences.
  - The final check ensures that if the entire array is the same or if there are no sequences of consecutive elements, it prints `-1`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the array has only one element (which is always beautiful and impossible to make non-beautiful).
  - It also handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, correctly outputting `-1`.

- **Optimizations**:
  - The program efficiently processes the array in a single pass, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs `-1` if it is impossible.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
