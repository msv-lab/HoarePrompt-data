### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can have all elements the same or can be modified by replacing elements at specific indices to make all elements the same.
   - If it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, we output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If the entire array is a single segment of the same number, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, it should not print 1 because the array is already not beautiful.
   - The logic for updating `i` and `num` is flawed. The program increments `i` by 1 even when `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, which can lead to incorrect segment lengths being calculated.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The program should correctly identify the minimum segment length of the same number that is not the entire array.
   - It should also handle the case where the array is already not beautiful by checking if there are any two adjacent elements that are different.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful and may incorrectly calculate the minimum segment length due to the flawed logic in updating `i` and `num`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
