To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.

### Code of the loop:
```python
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop runs `a` times.
2. In each iteration, two integers `b` and `c` are read from the input.
3. The tuple `q` is assigned the values of `b` and `c`.
4. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, one of the following is printed:
   - 'YES' if `b == c`
   - 'NO' if `b < c`
   - 'Yes' if `a % 2 == b % 2`
   - 'No' otherwise

### Variables Affected:
- `i` (loop counter)
- `b` and `c` (input values)
- `q` (tuple of `b` and `c`)

### Variables Not Affected:
- `n` and `m` (not modified within the loop)

### Output State:
After the loop has executed all iterations:
- The loop counter `i` will have completed its range from 0 to `a-1`.
- The values of `b` and `c` will be the last values read from the input.
- The tuple `q` will be the last tuple of `b` and `c`.
- The values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
The loop will have executed `a` times, and during each iteration, it will have read two integers `b` and `c` from the input. The final values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers read, and the tuple `q` will contain these final values. The values of `n` and `m` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.

### Output State:
Output State: **The loop has executed `a` times. The final values of `b` and `c` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and the tuple `q` contains these final values. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
