The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it starts at 0. The conditions for `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100) are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
