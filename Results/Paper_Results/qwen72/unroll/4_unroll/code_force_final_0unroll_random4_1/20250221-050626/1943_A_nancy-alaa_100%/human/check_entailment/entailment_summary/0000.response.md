Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the game between Alice and Bob by determining the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game when both players play optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies for both players:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she should try to include as many small integers as possible in the array `c` to delay the appearance of the smallest missing integer (MEX).
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the score, so he should try to remove the smallest integers that are not yet in `c` to make the MEX as small as possible.

The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` to find the first integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is the first unique integer in `arr` after a unique integer has been found.

Let's break down the logic:

- **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- **Counting Elements**: For each test case, it uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- **Finding the MEX**:
  - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n`.
  - If an integer `i` is not in `arr`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, as this is the MEX.
  - If an integer `i` is in `arr` and is unique (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1`), it checks if a unique integer has already been found (`first` is `True`). If so, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
  - If a unique integer `i` is found for the first time, it sets `first` to `True`.

This logic correctly identifies the MEX under the optimal play conditions for both Alice and Bob. Here's why:

- **Case 1**: If `i` is not in `arr`, it is the smallest integer that is missing, and thus the MEX.
- **Case 2**: If `i` is unique and `first` is `True`, it means that a unique integer has already been found, and Bob will remove this unique integer, making `i` the MEX.
- **Case 3**: If `i` is unique and `first` is `False`, it means this is the first unique integer found, and Alice will include it in `c`.

The program handles the constraints and the example cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
