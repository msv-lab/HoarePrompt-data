You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then finds and prints the first integer `i` (starting from 0) that is either not present in `arr` or is the first unique integer in `arr` after a unique integer has been found. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as input at the beginning. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes `t` being decremented to 0, while `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a` and manipulate an array `c`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the score, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning they will always make the best move to achieve their respective goals.
   - Alice will try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers in `c` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the MEX of `c`.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Counter Usage:** The `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct because it helps in determining which elements are present and how many times.
   - **First Variable:** The variable `first` is used to track if Alice has encountered a unique element (i.e., an element that appears exactly once in `arr`).
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
     - If such an `i` is found, it is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
     - If `i` is in `arr` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it means Bob has already removed the unique element, so Alice cannot include it in `c`. In this case, `i` is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
     - If `i` is in `arr` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will include this element in `c` on her first turn, and `first` is set to `True`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the MEX is the smallest integer not in `arr`.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where Bob can remove a unique element to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly calculates the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**True**
