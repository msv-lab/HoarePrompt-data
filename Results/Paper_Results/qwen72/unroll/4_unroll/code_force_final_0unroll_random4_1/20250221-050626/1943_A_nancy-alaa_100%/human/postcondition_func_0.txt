The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then finds and prints the first integer `i` (starting from 0) that is either not present in `arr` or is the first unique integer in `arr` after a unique integer has been found. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as input at the beginning. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes `t` being decremented to 0, while `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case.
