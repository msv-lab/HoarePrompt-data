Output State: `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the closest city in the forward direction. For each city, if the closest city is in the forward direction, the element is 1; otherwise, it is the distance to the closest city. The list `cities` remains unchanged.
