The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, where each integer represents a city's position on a number line (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it, depending on whether the city immediately after it is closer than the city immediately before it.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of city positions `cities` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is 1 if the city immediately after is closer than the city immediately before, or the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it otherwise.**
