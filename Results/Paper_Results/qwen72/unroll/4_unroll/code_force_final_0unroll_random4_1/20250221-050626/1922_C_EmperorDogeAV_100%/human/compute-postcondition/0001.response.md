To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the range of the loop. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 0, and the loop will iterate `n - 1` times.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, and `i` will start at 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions are met.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0, and `n - 1` must be greater than 0**
