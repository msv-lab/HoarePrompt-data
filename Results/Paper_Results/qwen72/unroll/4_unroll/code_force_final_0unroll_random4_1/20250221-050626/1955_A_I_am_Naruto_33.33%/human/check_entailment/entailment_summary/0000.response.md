Reasoning:  
The program `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`. This is correct because there is no promotion to consider when buying only one yogurt.
3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: The cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd) are bought at the regular price.
4. **Minimum Cost**: The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

The logic for calculating `ans2` is correct because:
- `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price.
- `n % 2` gives the number of additional yogurts (0 or 1) that need to be bought at the regular price if `n` is odd.

The program correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated and printed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
