#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cards_left(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of occurrences of each unique integer in the list `l`. If the maximum count of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the frequency of each unique integer in the list. If the maximum frequency of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified within the function.
