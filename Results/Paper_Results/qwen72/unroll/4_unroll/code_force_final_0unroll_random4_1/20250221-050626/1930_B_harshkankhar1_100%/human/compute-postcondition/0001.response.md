The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
2. **Code Impact**: The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `a` are reversed.
3. **Calculation**:
   - If `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, the even indices will contain the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc.
   - Reversing these elements means that the first element at an even index will swap places with the last element at an even index, the second element at an even index will swap places with the second-to-last element at an even index, and so on.

For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`:
- Even indices: 0, 2, 4
- Elements at even indices: 1, 3, 5
- Reversed elements at even indices: 5, 3, 1
- Updated list: `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with the elements at even indices reversed.**
