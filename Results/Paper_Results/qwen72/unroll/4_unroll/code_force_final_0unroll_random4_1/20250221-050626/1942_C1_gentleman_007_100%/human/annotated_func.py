    #The program returns a map object that converts the input values, provided by the user and split by spaces, into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into space-separated values, converts each value into an integer, and returns a map object containing the converted integers. The function does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
