#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) as input, and handle multiple test cases where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) is provided. The function should return a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be constructed, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n` from the user. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it will print 'NO'. If `n` is even, it will print 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters. The pattern will alternate between 'A' and 'B' and will have a length of `n`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the last input value read. The list `pattern` will be populated with the last generated pattern if `n` was even, otherwise, it will be an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the user, which is the desired length of a string to be generated. If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B' characters. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `t` will be unchanged, `n` will hold the last input value read, and `pattern` will be an empty list if the last `n` was odd, or will contain the last generated pattern if the last `n` was even.
