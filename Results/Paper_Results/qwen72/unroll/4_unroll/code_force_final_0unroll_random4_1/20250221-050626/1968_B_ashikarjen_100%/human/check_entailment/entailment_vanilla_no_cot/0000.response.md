Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by determining the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through each character of `a` and tries to find a matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`. If a match is found, it increments `k` and moves to the next character in `b`. If no match is found for a character in `a`, it breaks out of the loop, ensuring that the maximum `k` is found. The program then prints the value of `k` for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.
