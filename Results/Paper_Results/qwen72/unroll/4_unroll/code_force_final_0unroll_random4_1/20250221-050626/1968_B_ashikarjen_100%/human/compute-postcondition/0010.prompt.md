You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same binary string provided by the user, `n` remains the same integer provided by the user, `m` remains the same integer provided by the user, `t` remains the same integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` remains the same binary string provided by the user, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order, `j` is the position in `b` just after the last matching character found or `m` if no more matches are found.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `n` and `m`, which are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively. The function also handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t`. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
