Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The approach taken by the program is to iterate through both strings using two pointers, \( i \) and \( j \), where \( i \) points to the current character in \( a \) and \( j \) points to the current character in \( b \). The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of \( a[i] \) in \( b[j:] \). If such an occurrence is found, the pointers are advanced, and the count \( c \) is incremented. If no such occurrence is found, the loop breaks, and the current count \( c \) is printed as the result.

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1`:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths \( n \) and \( m \) of the binary strings \( a \) and \( b \), respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while both \( i \) and \( j \) are within the bounds of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It calls `func_1` to find the next occurrence of \( a[i] \) in \( b[j:] \).
   - If an occurrence is found, it advances \( j \) to the position after the found character, increments \( i \), and increments the count \( c \).
   - If no occurrence is found, the loop breaks.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` searches for the first occurrence of \( a[i] \) in the substring \( b[j:] \).
   - If found, it returns the index of the found character relative to the start of \( b \).
   - If not found, it returns -1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the count \( c \), which represents the maximum \( k \).

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of \( a \) form a subsequence of \( b \). The function `func_1` correctly handles the search for the next character in \( b \) and returns the appropriate index or -1 if the character is not found. The main loop correctly advances the pointers and increments the count accordingly.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
