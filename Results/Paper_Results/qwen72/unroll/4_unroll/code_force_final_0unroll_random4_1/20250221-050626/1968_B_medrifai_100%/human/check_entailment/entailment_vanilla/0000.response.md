### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0. 
     - `i` is the index for string `a`.
     - `j` is the index for string `b`.
     - `c` is the count of the maximum prefix length that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Loop to Find Subsequence**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the strings `a` and `b` until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` using the `find` method.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in `b` relative to the start of the substring.
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Update Indices and Count**:
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j != -1`), the indices `i` and `j` are updated, and the count `c` is incremented.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, the loop breaks, indicating that the current character in `a` cannot be found in the remaining part of `b`.

6. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the count `c`, which represents the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for finding the maximum prefix length that is a subsequence is sound. It iterates through both strings and uses the `find` method to locate the next matching character.
- The function `func_1` is designed to return the correct index or `-1` if the character is not found, which is used to break the loop when necessary.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` are empty or when `b` does not contain any characters from `a`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
