You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of s such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')

        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the string input by the user)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6), `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists, otherwise `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: aaab bbccc
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
            #
            #Therefore, based on the given precondition and the code snippet, the output will be:
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: [s[:x + 2]] [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end)
        #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1, and the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`. Additionally, if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies the condition, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from user input and checks if the string can be split into two substrings such that the second substring does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`. If `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`, it prints 'YES', '1', and the original string `s`, then exits. If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' and exits. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False` for the first differing character at index `x`, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True` and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. In all cases, the function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string is a palindrome and consists of the same character repeated. For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not find a non-palindromic substring. However, according to the problem description, if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, it should still be possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, such as "a" and "aaaa" or "aa" and "aaa". The program fails to consider this edge case, leading to an incorrect output.
