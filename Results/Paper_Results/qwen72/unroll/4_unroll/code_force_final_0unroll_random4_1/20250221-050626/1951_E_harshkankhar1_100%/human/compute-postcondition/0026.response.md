Postcondition: ***`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies the condition, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.***
