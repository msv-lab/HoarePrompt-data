The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these directly affect the `print` statement. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is given that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `x` is set to -1.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the integer `1`.
   - The variables `s`, `n`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s)` do not influence the `print` statement in any way.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
