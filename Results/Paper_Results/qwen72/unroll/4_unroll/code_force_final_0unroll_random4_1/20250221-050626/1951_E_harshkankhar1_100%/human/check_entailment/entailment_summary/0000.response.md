### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and essential for determining if a substring is a palindrome.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from user input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '1', and the original string `s`, then returns.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of `s`.
     - If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' and returns.
   - If a differing character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:
- **Case 1: Entire string is not a palindrome**:
  - The function correctly prints 'YES', '1', and the original string `s`.
  - This is correct because if the entire string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single non-palindromic substring.

- **Case 2: All characters in the string are the same**:
  - The function correctly prints 'NO'.
  - This is correct because if all characters are the same, any substring will also be a palindrome, making it impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

- **Case 3: First differing character found**:
  - The function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where all characters are the same.
  - However, the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2` might not be necessary. If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it should still be possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings by adjusting the partition point. The current logic might incorrectly print 'NO' in some cases where a valid partition exists.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_2` is mostly correct but has a potential issue with the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2`. This condition might incorrectly rule out valid partitions in some cases.

### Correctness:
- **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the potential issue with the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2`. This condition might lead to incorrect outputs in some edge cases where a valid partition exists but is not found.
