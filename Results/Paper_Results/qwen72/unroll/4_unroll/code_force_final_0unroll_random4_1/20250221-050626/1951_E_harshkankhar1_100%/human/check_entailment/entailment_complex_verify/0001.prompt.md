You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of s such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.

    #State: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6), `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists, otherwise `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: aaab bbccc
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
            #
            #Therefore, based on the given precondition and the code snippet, the output will be:
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES

            #This is printed: [s[:x + 2]] [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end)
        #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1, and the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`. Additionally, if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies the condition, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from user input and checks if the string can be split into two substrings such that the second substring does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`. If `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`, it prints 'YES', '1', and the original string `s`, then exits. If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' and exits. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False` for the first differing character at index `x`, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True` and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. In all cases, the function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - The function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct.
   - If the string `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
     - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters in the string are the same), it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If `x` is found, it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If the substring starting from `x + 1` is a palindrome, it checks two conditions:
       - If `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, it is a palindrome. The function will correctly print "NO" because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same, the function will correctly print "NO" because any substring of such a string is a palindrome.
   - **Non-Palindromic String**: If `s` is already non-palindromic, the function will correctly print "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
   - **Mixed Characters**: If `s` contains mixed characters, the function will correctly find a partition where at least one substring is non-palindromic.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The function iterates through the string once to find the first non-matching character, which is \(O(n)\).
   - The palindrome check is also \(O(n)\).
   - Overall, the function is efficient and handles the constraints given in the problem.

### Correctness:
The provided program is **not entirely correct**. The logic in the `func_2` function is flawed in certain cases:

- **Case 1**: If the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same (e.g., "lllllllll"), the function correctly prints "NO".
- **Case 2**: If the string is a palindrome and there is a single different character (e.g., "abccba"), the function correctly finds a partition and prints "YES" with the partition.
- **Case 3**: If the string is a palindrome and the first non-matching character is at index 1 or `n // 2`, the function incorrectly prints "NO" in some cases where a valid partition exists.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- For the string "abccba", the function correctly prints:
  ```
  YES
  2
  a bccba
  ```
- For the string "uwuowouwu", the function incorrectly prints "NO" because it fails to find a valid partition when `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`. We can do this by checking if the substring `s[:x + 2]` is non-palindromic and then partitioning accordingly.

```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    x = -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if not func_1(s[x + 1:]):
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif not func_1(s[:x + 2]):
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage:
# t = int(input())
# for _ in range(t):
#     func_2()
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
