Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the same string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` remains -1, indicating that there is no character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.

The `print` statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or objects; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
