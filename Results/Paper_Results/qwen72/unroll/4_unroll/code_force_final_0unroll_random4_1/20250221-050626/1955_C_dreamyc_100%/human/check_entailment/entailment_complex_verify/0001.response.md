### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into the list `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will sink. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The function calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of ships that sink.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative durability of the ships attacked from the front and the back.

4. **Loop for Attack Simulation**:
   - The loop iterates over each ship and adds its durability to `s_a` and `s_b` for the front and back attacks, respectively.
   - If the cumulative durability `s_a` is less than or equal to the number of front attacks `a`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the ship has sunk.
   - Similarly, if the cumulative durability `s_b` is less than or equal to the number of back attacks `b`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the ship has sunk.

5. **Issues with the Original Assessment**:
   - **Double Counting**: The program may double count a ship if it is attacked from both the front and the back. For example, if a ship is attacked from the front and then from the back, it should only be counted once as sunk, but the current implementation might count it twice.
   - **Incorrect Logic for Alternating Attacks**: The logic for alternating attacks is not correctly implemented. The program should simulate the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and stop once the number of attacks `k` is exhausted.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state before the function call and the initial conditions.
   - The annotated code also correctly describes the state after the function call.
   - However, the annotations do not address the issues of double counting and incorrect logic for alternating attacks.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The corrected implementation provided in the original assessment uses a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends as they sink.
   - It simulates the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and ensures that each ship is only counted once when it sinks.

### Final Answer:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues of double counting and incorrect logic for alternating attacks. The corrected implementation provided in the original assessment addresses these issues and correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks.

Final: **False**
