Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` with each element in the range 1 to 10^9. The function computes and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements from index `i` to `n-1` in a list `c` that contains the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value. **
