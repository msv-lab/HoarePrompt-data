You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to group the numbers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value at any position from the 1st to the 31st bit.
   - This means that for any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x \oplus y \) should have all bits set to 1 in the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers \( a \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with \( n \) and \( a \) as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum number of groups required.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `res` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of groups.
     - `count` is a dictionary that will keep track of the count of numbers or their complements.
   - **Loop through the Numbers**:
     - For each number `num` in the list \( a \):
       - If `num` is not in the `count` dictionary, it adds the complement of `num` (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`) to the dictionary and increments `res` by 1.
       - If `num` is already in the `count` dictionary, it decrements the count of `num` in the dictionary.
   - **Return the Result**:
     - The function returns `res`, which is the number of groups.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - **Complement Calculation**:
     - The program calculates the complement of `num` using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. This is correct for 32-bit integers, as it flips all the bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
   - **Grouping Logic**:
     - The logic for grouping is flawed. The program only checks if the number itself is in the dictionary and then adds the complement. This does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value at any position from the 1st to the 31st bit.
     - For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will incorrectly group them into 3 groups instead of 2 (since `1` and `3` can be in the same group as they differ in all bits).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to use a set to keep track of the numbers that have been placed in a group. For each number, check if its complement is already in the set. If it is, place the number in a new group; otherwise, place it in the same group as its complement.
   - This ensures that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value at any position from the 1st to the 31st bit.

Given the flawed logic in the program, the program is incorrect.
