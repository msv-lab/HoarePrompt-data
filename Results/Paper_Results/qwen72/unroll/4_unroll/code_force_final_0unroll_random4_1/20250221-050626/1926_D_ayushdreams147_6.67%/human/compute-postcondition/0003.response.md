Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`, `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\) and the value is the count of how many times the original integer appeared in `a` minus the count of how many times the XORed integer appeared in `a`.**
