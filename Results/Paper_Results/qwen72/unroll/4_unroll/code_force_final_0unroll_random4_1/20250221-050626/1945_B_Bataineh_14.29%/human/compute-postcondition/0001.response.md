The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
