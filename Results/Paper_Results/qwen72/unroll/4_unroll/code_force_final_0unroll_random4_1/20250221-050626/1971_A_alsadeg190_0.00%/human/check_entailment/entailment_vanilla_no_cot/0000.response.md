Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` in the correct order. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what is required.

To fix this, the `if` and `else` blocks should be swapped, or the `print` statement should be modified to always print the minimum followed by the maximum. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This will ensure that the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed first, followed by the maximum.
