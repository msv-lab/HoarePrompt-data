Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to 10^18.
- The current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

The code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
