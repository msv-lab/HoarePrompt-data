Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
- `costs` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
- `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
- The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` is `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `1 - k` is a non-zero integer (assuming `k` is not 1), `0 // (1 - k)` is 0.

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` is `0 // 1`, which is 0.

3. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1`.
   - `h` is `0 + 0`, which is 0.

4. **Check the condition `h < k`**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - The condition `0 < k` must be true for the initial state to be valid (since it is given that `h` is less than `k`).

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
