You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The loop has executed all iterations and printed the results for each test case, but the function itself has not been updated to match the problem description.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "Possible" if it is feasible to color the cells of a square grid of size `n` such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, or "Not Possible" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
