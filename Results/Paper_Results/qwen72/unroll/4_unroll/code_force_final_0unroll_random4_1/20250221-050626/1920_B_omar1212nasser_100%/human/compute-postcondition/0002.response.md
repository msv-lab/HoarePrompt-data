Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements[i]` <= 1000, `pos` is a list containing a single element, which is the value of `s` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.**
