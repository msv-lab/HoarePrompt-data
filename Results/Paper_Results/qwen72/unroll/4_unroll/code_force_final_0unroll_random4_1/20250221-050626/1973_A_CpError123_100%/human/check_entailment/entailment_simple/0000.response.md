### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total number of points in a series of chess games must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculation of Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, assuming each game results in 2 points.
   - The program then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred if all draws were between the first two players.
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Correctness of the Calculation:**
   - The calculation `x = (a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of games played, given that each game results in 2 points.
   - The calculation `y = a + b` is intended to represent the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all draws were between the first two players. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of draws.

5. **Flaw in the Calculation:**
   - The program should consider the maximum number of draws that can occur while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The correct approach is to calculate the maximum number of draws by considering the difference in scores and the total points. The maximum number of draws is the maximum value of `d` such that the remaining points can be distributed as wins and losses.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The maximum number of draws `d` can be calculated as follows:
     - Let `total_points = a + b + c`.
     - The number of games played is `total_games = total_points // 2`.
     - The number of wins (2 points) is `total_wins = total_points - d`.
     - The number of wins must be even because each win results in 2 points.
     - The maximum number of draws `d` is `min(total_games, (c - a) // 2 + (b - a) // 2)`.

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The calculation `y = a + b` is not a valid way to determine the maximum number of draws, and the program should consider the distribution of points more carefully.

Correctness: **False**
