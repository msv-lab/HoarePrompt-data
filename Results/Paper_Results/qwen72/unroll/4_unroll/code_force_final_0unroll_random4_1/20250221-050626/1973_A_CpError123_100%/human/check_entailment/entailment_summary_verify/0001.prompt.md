You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the function prints the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified and remain as they were read from the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if there is a draw). Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculate Total Points and Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The program then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all games were draws and the third player (with score `c`) had no wins or losses.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Valid Scores Check:**
  - If the sum of the scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Total Points Calculation:**
  - `x` is the total number of games played, which is correct because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
  - `y` is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores. This is a valid upper bound for the number of draws because if all games were draws, the third player (with score `c`) would have no wins or losses, and the total number of draws would be `a + b`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which ensures that the number of draws is within the valid range.

### Edge Cases:

- **All Scores Zero:**
  - If all scores are zero, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.

- **One Draw:**
  - If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one game ended in a draw.

- **Inconsistent Scores:**
  - If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.

- **Maximum Draws:**
  - If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is 6, and the total number of games is 6.

- **Large Score Difference:**
  - If the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is 2, and the total number of games is 6.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
