### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if there is a draw). Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculate Total Points and Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The program then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all games were draws and the third player (with score `c`) had no wins or losses.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Valid Scores Check:**
  - If the sum of the scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Total Points Calculation:**
  - `x` is the total number of games played, which is correct because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
  - `y` is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores. This is a valid upper bound for the number of draws because if all games were draws, the third player (with score `c`) would have no wins or losses, and the total number of draws would be `a + b`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which ensures that the number of draws is within the valid range.

### Edge Cases:

- **All Scores Zero:**
  - If all scores are zero, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.

- **One Draw:**
  - If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one game ended in a draw.

- **Inconsistent Scores:**
  - If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.

- **Maximum Draws:**
  - If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is 6, and the total number of games is 6.

- **Large Score Difference:**
  - If the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is 2, and the total number of games is 6.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the program is correct.
