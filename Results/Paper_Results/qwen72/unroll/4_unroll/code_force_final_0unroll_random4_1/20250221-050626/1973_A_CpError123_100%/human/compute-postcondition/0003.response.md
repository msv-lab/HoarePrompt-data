The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or process values `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function's output is not specified in the given context, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely returns a result based on the processing of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes values `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a result based on the processing of these values, but the specific output is not provided.**
