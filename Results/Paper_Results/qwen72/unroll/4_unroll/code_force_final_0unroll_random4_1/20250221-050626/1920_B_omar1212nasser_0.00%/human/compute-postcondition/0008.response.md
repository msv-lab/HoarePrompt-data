Output State: **The list `pos` contains the values calculated as (s - 2 * n) after each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged.**
