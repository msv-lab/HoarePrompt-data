Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Special Case Handling:** The function `func_2` has a special case where if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, it returns 0. This is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Moves:** The logic for Bob's moves is flawed. Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum, but the current implementation incorrectly tries to adjust the sum by accessing elements from the end of the sorted list.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:** The sum calculation in `func_2` is not correctly handling the removal and negation of elements. The logic for updating `s` and `n` is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

4. **IndexError Handling:** The `try-except` block for handling `IndexError` is not a robust way to manage the logic. It can lead to incorrect results when the indices go out of bounds.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Sort the array to facilitate the optimal removal and negation of elements.
- Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
- Bob should multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
- The program should handle all edge cases and ensure that the logic is consistent with the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest elements to maximize the sum
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the remaining elements
    s = sum(elements)
    
    # Bob multiplies the smallest remaining elements by -1
    negatives = min(negatives, len(elements))
    elements[:negatives] = [-e for e in elements[:negatives]]
    
    # Calculate the new sum after Bob's moves
    s = sum(elements)
    
    return s

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by removing the smallest elements and multiplying the smallest remaining elements by -1, respectively.
