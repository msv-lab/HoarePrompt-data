Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. Otherwise, it calculates a series of values by iteratively removing the last `removals` elements from `elements` and adjusting the sum of the remaining elements and the sum of the last `negatives` elements. It returns the maximum value from this series of calculations. The input parameters `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, and the list `elements` is not modified. **
