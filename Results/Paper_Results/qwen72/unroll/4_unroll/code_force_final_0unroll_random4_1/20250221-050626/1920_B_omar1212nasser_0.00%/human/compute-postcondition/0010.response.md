The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= removals <= len(elements)` and `0 <= negatives <= len(elements)`. `elements` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 to 1000.

**Case_1:** The function returns 0.

**Case_2:** The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains values calculated as `(s - 2 * n)` after each iteration of the loop. Here, `s` is the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list of calculated values, where each value is the result of subtracting twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements from the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements.**
