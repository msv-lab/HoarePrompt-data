### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(n, x, y, a):`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads `n`, `x`, `y` from the input and converts the list of vertices `a` to a 0-indexed list.
   - It initializes `present` as a set of the chosen vertices and `ans` as `x - 2`.

3. **First Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the chosen vertices `a` and checks if the next vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `present` and the vertex after that `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `present`.
   - If true, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - This loop correctly counts the number of triangles that can be formed by adding a single vertex to the existing chosen vertices.

4. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, considering the list as circular.
   - It appends the positive gaps to the `gaps` list.
   - This step is necessary to identify the potential vertices that can be added to maximize the number of triangles.

5. **Sorting and Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The `gaps` list is sorted.
   - The function then iterates over the sorted `gaps` and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added within each gap.
   - If `y` (the number of additional vertices you can choose) is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decrements `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
   - This step ensures that the maximum number of triangles is formed by adding the most beneficial vertices first.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flow that aligns with the problem description. However, the function `func_1` is not properly defined to take the required parameters. This is a critical issue that would prevent the program from running correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To make the program correct, the function `func_1` should be defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(n, x, y, a):
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
    print(ans)
```

And the main part of the program should call this function with the appropriate arguments:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        func_1(n, x, y, a)
```
