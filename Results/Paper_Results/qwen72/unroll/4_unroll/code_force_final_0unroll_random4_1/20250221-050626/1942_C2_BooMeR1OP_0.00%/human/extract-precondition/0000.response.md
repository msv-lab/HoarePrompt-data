Precondition: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem description. The function should take parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
```

**Precondition:**
**t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
**For each test case:**
**- n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the number of sides of the polygon.**
**- x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.**
**- y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.**
**- chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
**The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
