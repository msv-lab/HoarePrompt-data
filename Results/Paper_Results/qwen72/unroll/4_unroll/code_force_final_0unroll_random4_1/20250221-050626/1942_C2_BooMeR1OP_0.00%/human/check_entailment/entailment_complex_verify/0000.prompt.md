You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #This is printed: - The value of `ans` is a combination of the initial value of `x - 2`, the count of elements in `a` that satisfy the given conditions, the sum of `gap` values, and the final adjustment based on the last `gap` where `y` was less than `pairs`.
    #
    #Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `n`, `x`, `a`, `present`, `y`, and `gaps`, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions and variables.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates a value `ans` based on the following criteria: 
1. It initializes `ans` to `x - 2`.
2. It increments `ans` for each element in the list where the next element modulo `n` is not present in the list, but the element after that is.
3. It then calculates the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list (considering the list as circular) and sorts these gaps.
4. For each gap, if `y` is greater than or equal to half the gap, it adds the gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half the gap. If `y` is less than half the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of the original elements minus 1, `present` is a set containing all unique elements of `a`, and `gaps` is a list of the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the gap between two chosen vertices is exactly 2. According to the problem description, if there is a gap of 2 between two chosen vertices, you can add one vertex to form a triangle. However, the program incorrectly handles this case by not adding the vertex when the gap is exactly 2.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 1
1 3
```
In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3, and you can choose 1 additional vertex. The gap between vertices 1 and 3 is exactly 2 (vertices 2 and 4). By choosing vertex 2, you can form two triangles: (1, 2, 3) and (1, 3, 4). However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2.

This indicates that the program does not handle the edge case where the gap is exactly 2, leading to an incorrect result.
