The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables (n, m, and a) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
