The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates under the conditions that `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function operates under the conditions that `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even, but the specific output is not provided.**
