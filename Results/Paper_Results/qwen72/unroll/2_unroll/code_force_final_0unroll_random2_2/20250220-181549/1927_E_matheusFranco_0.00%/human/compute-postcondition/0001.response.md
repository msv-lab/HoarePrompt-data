The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is read from the standard input, and it is specified that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. No adjustments are needed.

State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` is the number of test cases.**
