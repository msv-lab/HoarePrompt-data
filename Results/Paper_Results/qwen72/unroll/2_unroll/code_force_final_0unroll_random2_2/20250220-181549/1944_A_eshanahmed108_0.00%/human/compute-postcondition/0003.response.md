The function `min_islands` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, with the constraint 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2. The function returns the minimum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (the number of islands) and `k` (the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed), and returns the minimum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges.**
