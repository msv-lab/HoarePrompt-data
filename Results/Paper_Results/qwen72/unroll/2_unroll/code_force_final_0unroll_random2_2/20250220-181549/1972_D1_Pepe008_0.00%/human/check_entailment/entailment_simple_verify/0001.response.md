### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Code Analysis:**
   - The initial code snippet contains a commented-out block of code that seems to be a brute-force approach to solving the problem.
   - The actual implementation uses a more optimized approach.

3. **Optimized Approach:**
   - The code iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It then checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum if the condition is true.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a non-negative integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - The term \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is subtracted from \(a\) to account for the offset.
   - The division by \(i^2\) and adding 1 is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code subtracts 1 from the final sum before printing. This is necessary because the formula might count an extra pair that is not valid.
   - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that \(a\) is positive and within the range.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The formula used is derived from the problem's mathematical condition and seems to be correct.
   - The edge case handling (subtracting 1 from the final sum) is also appropriate.

However, there is a critical issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

- **Critical Issue:**
  - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not correct. The correct formula should be \((a // i) - (i - 1)\) to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
  - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) is not necessary and can be removed.
  - The subtraction of 1 from the final sum is not always correct and can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a // i) - (i - 1)
            if x > 0:
                suma += x
        
        print(suma)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the formula used in the code is incorrect. The corrected formula \((a // i) - (i - 1)\) should be used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(i\). The subtraction of 1 from the final sum is also not always necessary and should be removed.

Final: **False**
