The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `(a, b)` from the input. It then calculates a value based on these integers and prints the result, which is the sum of the number of valid `i` values that satisfy the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i
