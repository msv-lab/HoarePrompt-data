Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be that the variable `t` will be reduced to 0, as the loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes one test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` will be reinitialized or modified for each test case within the loop, but their final values will depend on the last test case processed. The loop will print 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
