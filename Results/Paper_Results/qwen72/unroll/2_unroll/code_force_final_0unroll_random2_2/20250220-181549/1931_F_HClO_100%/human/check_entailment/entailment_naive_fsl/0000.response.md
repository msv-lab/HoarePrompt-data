Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the order of participants in the screenshots is not consistent with a single order of participants.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 1 3 4
3 1 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this test case, the first screenshot shows the order [1, 2, 3, 4], the second screenshot shows the order [2, 1, 3, 4], and the third screenshot shows the order [3, 1, 2, 4]. There is no single order of participants that can produce these three screenshots. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this test case.
