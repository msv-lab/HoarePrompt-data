The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` unique integers each. The function processes each test case to determine if the order of participants in the screenshots can be made consistent by inserting a single participant into one of the lists. If the order can be made consistent, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the variables from the last test case processed.
