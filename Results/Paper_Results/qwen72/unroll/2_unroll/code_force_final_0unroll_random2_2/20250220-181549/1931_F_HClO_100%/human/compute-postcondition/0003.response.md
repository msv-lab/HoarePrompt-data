Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the input for each case, and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the loop. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` will be 0 if the loop has completed all iterations, and the other variables will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.**
