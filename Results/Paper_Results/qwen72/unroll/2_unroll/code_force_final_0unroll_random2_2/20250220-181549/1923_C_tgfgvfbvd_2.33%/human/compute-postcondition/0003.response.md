Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `l` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query defined by two integers `a` and `b`, the function checks if the sum of elements in the prefix sum array `p` from index `a-1` to `b-1` is at least twice the length of the subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values but outputs the results directly. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the output for each query has been printed. The variables used within each test case are reset for the next test case, ensuring independent processing. **
