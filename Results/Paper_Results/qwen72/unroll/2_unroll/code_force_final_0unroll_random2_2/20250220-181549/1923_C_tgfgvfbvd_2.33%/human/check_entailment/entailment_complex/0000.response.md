### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sum array `p` from the input array `l`. This is done by iterating through `l` and accumulating the sum in `c`, appending each cumulative sum to `p`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sum array `p`. This is done by subtracting `p[a-2]` from `p[b-1]` if `a-2` is a valid index (i.e., `a-2 >= 0`), otherwise, it directly uses `p[b-1]`.
   - The program then checks if the length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is based on the condition that for a subarray to be good, the sum of the elements in the subarray must be at least twice the number of elements in the subarray, ensuring that there is enough "slack" to construct a different array `b` with positive elements that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise. This is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are the same, which should result in 'NO' because the subarray has only one element, and there is no way to construct a different array `b` with positive elements that satisfy the conditions.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray length is greater than 1 and the sum of the subarray is not sufficient to construct the required array `b`.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input in the correct format and processes multiple test cases as specified.
   - The output is printed in the correct format, with 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.
