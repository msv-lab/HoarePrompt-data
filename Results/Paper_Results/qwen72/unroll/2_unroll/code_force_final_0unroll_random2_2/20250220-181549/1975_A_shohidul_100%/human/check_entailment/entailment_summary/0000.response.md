Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, the program prints 'YES'. If not, it tries to find a split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split point is found, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks for the first occurrence where the array is not non-decreasing and then immediately tries to split the array at that point. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Single Split Point**: The program only checks one possible split point (the first point where the array is not non-decreasing). It does not consider other possible split points, which might lead to a valid non-decreasing array after the swap.
2. **Incorrect Split Condition**: The condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` is not correct. It checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array, which is not the correct condition for ensuring the array becomes non-decreasing after the swap.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the first and last points where the array is not non-decreasing.
- Check if the subarray between these points can be swapped with the rest of the array to form a non-decreasing array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first and last points where the array is not non-decreasing
        first = 0
        last = n - 1
        while first < n - 1 and a[first] <= a[first + 1]:
            first += 1
        while last > 0 and a[last] >= a[last - 1]:
            last -= 1
        
        # If the array is already sorted or the non-decreasing part is at the beginning or end
        if first >= last:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check if the subarray between first and last can be swapped to form a non-decreasing array
        if a[last] <= a[first] and all(a[i] <= a[(i + 1) % n] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

Explanation:
- The program first checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
- If not, it finds the first and last points where the array is not non-decreasing.
- If the non-decreasing part is at the beginning or end, the array can be sorted by a single swap.
- Finally, it checks if the subarray between these points can be swapped to form a non-decreasing array by ensuring the last element of the subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the subarray and the entire array is non-decreasing after the swap.

Given the original program's logic, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
