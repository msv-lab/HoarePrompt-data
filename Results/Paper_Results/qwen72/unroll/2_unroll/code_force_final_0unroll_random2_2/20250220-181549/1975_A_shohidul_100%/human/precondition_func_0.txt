The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it internally processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
