Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the list is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes and no variables persist outside the function. **
