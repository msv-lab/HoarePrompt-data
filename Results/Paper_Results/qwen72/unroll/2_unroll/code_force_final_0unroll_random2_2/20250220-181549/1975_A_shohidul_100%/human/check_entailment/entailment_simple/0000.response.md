### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The function first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function and a list comprehension.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the Split Point**:
   - If the array is not sorted, the function iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - It then creates a new array `new` by splitting `a` at position `i` and swapping the prefix and suffix.

4. **Checking the New Array**:
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - Whether the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `new`.
     - Whether the new array `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition is not met, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues:
- **Break Statement**: The break statement is used after printing "NO" or "YES" in the inner loop, which means that the function will only check the first possible split point and not continue to check other potential split points. This can lead to incorrect results if there are multiple valid split points.
- **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where the array might be sorted after multiple operations or where the split point might be at the end of the array.

### Corrected Approach:
- The function should iterate through all possible split points and check if any of them result in a sorted array after the swap.
- If any valid split point is found, it should print "YES" and break out of the loop.
- If no valid split point is found after checking all possibilities, it should print "NO".

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the break statement and the need to check all possible split points, the current implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
