Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for reading input in a format where multiple test cases are provided.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - **Determining the Winner**: The function checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up % 2 == 1`). If it is, Alice will win because she can always make the first move, and the game will end in a finite number of operations with an odd number of moves, ensuring Alice makes the last move. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he will make the last move.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if Alice will win and "NO" otherwise, which matches the problem's requirements.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the logic implemented in the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
