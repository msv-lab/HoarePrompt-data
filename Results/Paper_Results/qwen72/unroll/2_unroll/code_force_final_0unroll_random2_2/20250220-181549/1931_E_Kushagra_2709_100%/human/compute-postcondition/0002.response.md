The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the string `num`. The loop will execute if the length of `num` is at least 1. The loop starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches -1, but it does not include -1 in the iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be a non-empty string, and `i` must start at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `tot` is 0**
