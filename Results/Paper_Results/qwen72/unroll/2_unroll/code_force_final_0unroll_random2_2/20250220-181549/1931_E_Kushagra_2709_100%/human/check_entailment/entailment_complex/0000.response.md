### Reasoning:

1. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer `num`.
   - It iterates from the end of the string representation of `num` and counts the number of zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros, which is accurate and meets the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums` by converting each number to a string and summing the lengths of these strings.
   - It then creates a list `cntvals` which contains the count of trailing zeros for each number in `nums`, sorted in descending order.
   - The function iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the count of trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits (`tot`).
   - Finally, it checks if the resulting `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, taking turns to manipulate the list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an integer, and Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, i.e., when there is only one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is not less than \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the impact of trailing zeros on the final concatenated number.
   - Trailing zeros in a number can be removed when the number is reversed, which affects the total number of digits in the final number.
   - By subtracting the counts of trailing zeros from the total number of digits, the function `func_1` effectively simulates the removal of these zeros during Anna's moves.
   - The function then checks if the remaining total number of digits is sufficient to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and `m` is 0 correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the numbers in `nums` have leading zeros, as these are removed when the number is reversed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The functions `zerocnts` and `func_1` work together to simulate the game and check the winning condition.

Correctness: **True**
