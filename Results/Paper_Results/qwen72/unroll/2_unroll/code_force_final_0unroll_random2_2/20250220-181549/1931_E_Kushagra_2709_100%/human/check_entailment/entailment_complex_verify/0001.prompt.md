You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), m is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `m` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `nums` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `tot` is the total number of digits in the list `nums` minus the sum of counts of zeros in the elements at even indices of `cntvals`, `cntvals` is a list of the counts of zeros in each element of `nums`, sorted in descending order.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the total number of digits in the list `nums` minus the sum of counts of zeros in the elements at even indices of `cntvals` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a non-negative integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums` and subtracts the sum of counts of zeros in the elements at even indices of a sorted list of zero counts from each element of `nums`. The function returns 'Sasha' if the resulting value is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:

    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):

        tot += 1
        
    #State: `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, the input parameter `num` remains unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the count of trailing zeros.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the winner of the game between Anna and Sasha.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of one element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move (i.e., there is exactly one number left in the list).
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins otherwise.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

### Program Analysis
#### Function 1: `func_1(n, m, nums)`
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This line calculates the total number of digits in all the numbers in the list.
2. **Count of Trailing Zeros**:
   - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This line calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
3. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros for every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros. This is done to simulate the effect of Anna's optimal moves, where she would reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first.
4. **Determine Winner**:
   - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This line checks if the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Function 2: `zerocnts(num)`
1. **Convert to String**:
   - `num = str(num)`: Convert the number to a string to easily count trailing zeros.
2. **Count Trailing Zeros**:
   - `tot = 0`: Initialize a counter for trailing zeros.
   - `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1): if num[i] != '0': break; tot += 1`: This loop counts the number of trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is encountered.

### Correctness Verification
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in each number.
3. **Optimal Moves**:
   - Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first. This is correctly simulated by sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting every second value.
4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The final condition `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'` correctly checks if the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), which determines the winner.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. It accurately calculates the total number of digits, simulates Anna's optimal moves, and checks the winning condition.

Correctness: **True**
