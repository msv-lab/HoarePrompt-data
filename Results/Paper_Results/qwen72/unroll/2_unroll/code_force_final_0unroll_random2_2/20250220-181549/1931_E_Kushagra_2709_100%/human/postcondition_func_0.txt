The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a non-negative integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums` and subtracts the sum of counts of zeros in the elements at even indices of a sorted list of zero counts from each element of `nums`. The function returns 'Sasha' if the resulting value is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
