Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `path` where each string is either '@' (indicating a sign of the apocalypse) or '*' (indicating an invalid or non-apocalyptic event). It returns 0 if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are invalid (i.e., '*'). Otherwise, it returns the maximum positive integer representing the best possible outcome based on the path, calculated by summing the signs of the apocalypse while avoiding invalid events. **
