Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem is about finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the program is designed to solve a completely different problem, which appears to be related to a path with special characters ('@' and '*') and calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected while avoiding '*'. 

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
