Output State: **`dp` is a list where each element is either `-inf` or a positive integer. The value of `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is determined by the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@'. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is `-inf`. The initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain unchanged.**
