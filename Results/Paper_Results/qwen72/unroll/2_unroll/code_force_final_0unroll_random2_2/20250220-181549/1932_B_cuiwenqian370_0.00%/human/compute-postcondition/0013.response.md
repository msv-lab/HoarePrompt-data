Postcondition: **`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. The second element of `path` is '*'.**
