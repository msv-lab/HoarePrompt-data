### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not match the problem description at all. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, and the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a string `path` as input and processes it to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected while avoiding '*'.
     - It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected up to each position in the string.
     - This function is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes a list of strings `data` containing input data for `t` test cases.
     - It extracts paths from `data` and applies `func_1` to each path, storing the results in a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results` to the standard output.
     - This function is also unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` confirms that it is designed to read input and process paths, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is designed to solve a different problem altogether. It does not address the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
