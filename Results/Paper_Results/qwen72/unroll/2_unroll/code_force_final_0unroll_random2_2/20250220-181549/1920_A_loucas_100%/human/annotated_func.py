#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `loop` times, and for each iteration, it processes `innerLoop` constraints. The variables `less`, `big`, and `no` are reset to empty lists at the start of each iteration. The variable `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` for each iteration, and if `num` is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it decrements `num` for each value in `no` that is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` (inclusive), and then prints the final value of `num`. The state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads the constraints and categorizes them into three lists: `big` for constraints where `x == 1`, `less` for constraints where `x == 2`, and `no` for constraints where `x == 3`. It then calculates the number of integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`. If this number is less than 1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it subtracts the count of values in `no` that fall within this range and prints the final result. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the input variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remains unchanged.
