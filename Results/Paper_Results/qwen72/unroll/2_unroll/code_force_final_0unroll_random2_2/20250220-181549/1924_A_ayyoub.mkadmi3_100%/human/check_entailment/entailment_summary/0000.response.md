Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of checking whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, it should output a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**: The function `func_1` only checks if the string `s` contains all `k` alphabets at least once and then constructs `s1` and `s2` based on this. It does not check for all possible subsequences of length `n` formed by the first `k` alphabets.

2. **Misinterpretation of `s1` and `s2`**: The variable `s1` is constructed by adding characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` alphabets. The variable `s2` is supposed to be a part of the string that can be used to form a non-occurring subsequence, but it is not constructed correctly. It only contains the last character of `s` if `s` contains all `k` alphabets at least once, which is not useful for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Boolean Return**: The boolean value returned by `func_1` is based on whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`. This is not a correct criterion for checking if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

4. **Incorrect Construction of Non-occurring Subsequence**: The program constructs a non-occurring subsequence by appending the same character `n - len(s2)` times to `s2`. This approach is flawed because `s2` is not constructed to ensure it is a valid subsequence, and the appended characters may not form a valid non-occurring subsequence.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings occurs as a subsequence in `s`.
- If any string does not occur, output "NO" and the non-occurring string.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
