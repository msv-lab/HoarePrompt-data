### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2`, and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `i` is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s, k, n)` and stores the result in `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False` (i.e., not all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`):
     - It finds the first character from the first `k` alphabets that is not in `s1`.
     - It constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using this character.
     - It appends `No` and the constructed string `s2 + be9i` to the `OUT` list.
   - If `b` is `True` (i.e., all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`):
     - It appends `Yes` to the `OUT` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints each element in the `OUT` list, which contains the results for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets whenever the length of `alphabet` becomes 1. This means that the function is not correctly tracking the subsequences. It essentially resets the tracking whenever it finds a complete set of `k` characters, which is not the correct approach for checking all possible subsequences of length `n`.
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid check for the problem. It only checks if the total number of characters in `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not accurately determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Final: **False**
