Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26). It processes `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` in the same order, and a string `s2` which is the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once, otherwise `s2` is an empty string. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`, and the string `s2`. **
