Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic.
   - The function `func_1` is removing characters from the `alphabet` set and then checking if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. This is not a valid way to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. Instead, it is just removing characters from the set and appending them to `s1` and `s2` in a way that does not ensure all possible subsequences are checked.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Missing Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending a character that is not in `s1` to a string of length `n - len(s2)`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This can be done using itertools or a recursive function.

2. **Check Subsequences**:
   - For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`. This can be done by iterating through `s` and checking if the characters of the generated string appear in the same order in `s`.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If all generated strings are subsequences of `s`, print "YES".
   - If any generated string is not a subsequence of `s`, print "NO" and the missing string.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
import itertools

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
    all_possible = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
    for possible in all_possible:
        if not is_subsequence(possible, s):
            print("NO")
            print(possible)
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This solution correctly generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" followed by the missing string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".
