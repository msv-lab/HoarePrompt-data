You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which is either the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once or an empty string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2`, and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `i` is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s, k, n)` and stores the result in `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False` (i.e., not all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`):
     - It finds the first character from the first `k` alphabets that is not in `s1`.
     - It constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using this character.
     - It appends `No` and the constructed string `s2 + be9i` to the `OUT` list.
   - If `b` is `True` (i.e., all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`):
     - It appends `Yes` to the `OUT` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints each element in the `OUT` list, which contains the results for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets whenever the length of `alphabet` becomes 1. This means that the function is not correctly tracking the subsequences.
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid check for the problem. It only checks if the total number of characters in `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not accurately determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
