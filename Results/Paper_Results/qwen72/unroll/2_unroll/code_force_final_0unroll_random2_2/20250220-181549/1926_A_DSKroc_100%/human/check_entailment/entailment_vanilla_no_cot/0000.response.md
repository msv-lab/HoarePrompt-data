Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` to determine the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. It compares these counts and prints the character that appears more frequently. The logic and the implementation are correct and will produce the expected output for the given input format and constraints.
