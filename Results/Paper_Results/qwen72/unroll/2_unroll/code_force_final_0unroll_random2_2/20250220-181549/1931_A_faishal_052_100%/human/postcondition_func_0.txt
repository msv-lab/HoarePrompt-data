The function reads an integer `cases` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) and calculates a sorted list of three integers that represent the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. The sum of these positions equals the original `lex` value. It then converts these positions into the corresponding lowercase letters and prints them. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `info` list contains `cases` sublists, each a sorted list of three integers, and the `cases` variable remains unchanged.
