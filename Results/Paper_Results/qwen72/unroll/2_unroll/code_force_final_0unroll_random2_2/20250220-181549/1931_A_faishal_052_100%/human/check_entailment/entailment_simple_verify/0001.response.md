### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and the encoded sum (`lex`) for each test case.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, an empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the three letters.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program iterates over a range of 2 (to handle the first two letters).
   - **First Condition (`lex < 28`)**: If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the first two letters are always 'a' (index 1), which is not necessarily true. For example, for `lex = 24`, the correct output should be "aav" (1 + 1 + 22), but the program will output "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1).
   - **Second Condition (`lex < 52`)**: If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it assumes that the first two letters are always 'z' (index 26), which is not necessarily true. For example, for `lex = 30`, the correct output should be "aaz" (1 + 1 + 28), but the program will output "zzz" (26 + 26 + -22), which is not valid.
   - **Third Condition (`lex <= 78`)**: This condition is redundant because it is already covered by the second condition. It does not add any new logic.

4. **Appending the Third Letter**: After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This value represents the position of the third letter.

5. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order of the letters. However, due to the incorrect logic in the previous steps, the sorting does not produce the correct result.

6. **Output**: The sorted positions are converted to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where 96 is the ASCII value of 'a' minus 1. The resulting string is printed.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Smaller Sums**: The logic for handling sums less than 28 is incorrect. The program should ensure that the first two letters are the smallest possible values, and the third letter is the remaining value to achieve the sum.
- **Incorrect Handling of Larger Sums**: The logic for handling sums greater than or equal to 52 is also incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of the first two letters being the largest possible values that keep the sum within the valid range, and the third letter should be the remaining value.
- **General Logic Flaw**: The program does not correctly distribute the sum among the three letters to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. It should prioritize the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then determine the third letter.

### Correct Approach:
- For a given `lex`, the correct approach is to start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then determine the third letter.
- If `lex` is less than 28, the first two letters should be 'a' (index 1), and the third letter should be `lex - 2`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52, the first letter should be 'a' (index 1), and the second letter should be the largest possible value that keeps the sum within the valid range, and the third letter should be the remaining value.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78, the first two letters should be the largest possible values that keep the sum within the valid range, and the third letter should be the remaining value.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
