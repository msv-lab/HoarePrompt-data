You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: The `info` list will contain `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. Each sublist represents the positions of three lowercase Latin letters derived from the input `lex` value, with the positions adjusted according to the conditions in the loop. The `lex` value is used to determine the positions, and the loop ensures that the sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value. The `cases` variable remains unchanged.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: The `info` list remains unchanged, containing `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. The `cases` variable also remains unchanged. The loop prints a string for each sublist in `info`, where each string consists of three lowercase Latin letters corresponding to the positions in the sublist. The sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Let's consider the case where the encoded value is 78:

- According to the problem, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 78 should be "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
- However, the program will output "zzz" incorrectly as "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53) or "bzz" (2 + 26 + 26 = 54), which are not the correct smallest words.

The program's logic for distributing the remaining value of `lex` among the three letters is not optimal and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated. For example, when `lex` is 78, the program will subtract 26 twice and then add the remaining 26 to the third letter, but it should instead distribute the 26s evenly to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
2. If the remaining value is still greater than or equal to 26, assign 26 to the second letter.
3. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Ensure the values are in the correct lexicographical order.

This approach ensures that the word is the lexicographically smallest possible word that sums to the given value.
