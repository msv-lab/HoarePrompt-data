Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78). The program attempts to achieve this by constructing a list of three integers that represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet, and then converting these positions to the corresponding letters.

However, the program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the list of positions. Specifically, the logic for determining the positions of the letters is incorrect:

1. **First Loop Condition**: The program checks if `lex` is less than 28. If so, it appends 1 to the list and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is correct for the first letter, but the program does this twice, which is not always correct. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append 1 twice, resulting in `[1, 1, 22]`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Second Loop Condition**: The program checks if `lex` is less than 52. If so, it appends 26 to the list and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of a smaller letter being used. For example, if `lex` is 51, the program will append 26 twice, resulting in `[26, 26, 1]`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Third Condition**: The program appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list. This is correct, but the overall logic is flawed due to the previous conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible value to the first letter.
- Then, assign the smallest possible value to the second letter, ensuring the sum of the first two letters does not exceed `lex`.
- Finally, assign the remaining value to the third letter.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        for i in range(3):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[i] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[i] = lex
                lex = 0
        arr.sort()
        word = ''.join(chr(pos + 96) for pos in arr)
        print(word)
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is found by always starting with the smallest possible values and adjusting as needed.

Given the original program's logical flaws, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
