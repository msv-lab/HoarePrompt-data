### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates to read the encoded integer for each test case.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a list of three integers representing the positions of the letters.
   - The logic in the loop is flawed:
     - The first condition `if lex < 28` always appends 1 and reduces `lex` by 1. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of using higher values to form the lexicographically smallest word.
     - The second condition `elif lex < 52` appends 26 and reduces `lex` by 26. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of using smaller values to form the lexicographically smallest word.
     - The third condition `elif lex <= 78` appends 26 and reduces `lex` by 26. This is redundant and incorrect for the same reason as the second condition.
   - The program should aim to use the smallest possible values for the first two positions to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The program sorts the list of positions, which is unnecessary because the positions should be determined in a way that already ensures the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The program then converts the positions to letters and prints the result.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
  - Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
  - Then, assign the smallest possible value to the second letter, ensuring the sum of the first two letters is as small as possible.
  - Finally, assign the remaining value to the third letter.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Initialize the positions of the three letters
        a, b, c = 1, 1, lex - 2
        
        # Ensure the positions are valid and lexicographically smallest
        while c > 26:
            a += 1
            b += 1
            c -= 26
        
        # Convert positions to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        
        print(word)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:**
  - `a` and `b` are initialized to 1, representing the smallest possible values for the first two letters.
  - `c` is initialized to `lex - 2`, which is the remaining value after assigning 1 to `a` and `b`.
- **Adjustment:**
  - The while loop ensures that `c` does not exceed 26 by incrementing `a` and `b` and reducing `c` by 26.
- **Conversion:**
  - The positions are converted to letters using `chr(position + 96)` and concatenated to form the word.

### Conclusion:
- The original program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum.
- The corrected program addresses the issues and ensures the correct output.

### Correctness:
**False**
