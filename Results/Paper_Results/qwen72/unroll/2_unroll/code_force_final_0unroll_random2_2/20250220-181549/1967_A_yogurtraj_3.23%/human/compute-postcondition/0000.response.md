To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `ii`**: This variable will be initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
2. **Result of `int(input())`**: This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and is within the range 1 to 100, we can assume that the input value will be `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that the loop can execute at least once, and `ii` should start from 0.

State: **`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (which is `t` in this context)**
