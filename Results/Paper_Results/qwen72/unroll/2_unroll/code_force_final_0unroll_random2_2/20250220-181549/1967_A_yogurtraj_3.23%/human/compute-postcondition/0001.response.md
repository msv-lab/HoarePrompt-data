Output State: **For each test case, the output state is the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins, k, such that the total cost of the cards is minimized. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified in the output state, but the loop calculates and prints the result for each test case.**
