You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: For each test case, the output state is the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins, k, such that the total cost of the cards is minimized. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified in the output state, but the loop calculates and prints the result for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of distinct types of cards `n` and the number of coins `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type. The function then calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k` such that the total cost of the cards is minimized. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not modified in the output state, but the loop computes and prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a set of cards with numbers from 1 to n.
   - We can buy up to k new cards.
   - We need to rearrange the cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

2. **Approach:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that each number from 1 to n appears at least once in the subarrays of length n.
   - To maximize the score, we need to balance the counts of each number so that the minimum count is as high as possible.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Sort the Counts:** The program starts by sorting the counts of each card type. This helps in identifying the minimum count and the gaps between counts.
   - **Distribute the Coins:** The program then iterates through the sorted counts and tries to distribute the coins to increase the minimum count.
   - **Break Condition:** If the number of coins required to equalize the counts up to the current index exceeds the available coins, the program breaks and calculates the maximum possible score.
   - **Final Calculation:** If there are remaining coins after the loop, they are used to further increase the minimum count. The score is then calculated based on the final counts.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:** The program initializes variables `r` (the current minimum count), `rem` (remaining coins after the last equalization), and `y` (the number of card types that have counts greater than the current minimum).
   - **Iterate and Equalize:** The program iterates through the sorted counts and tries to equalize the counts up to the current index. If the required coins exceed the available coins, it breaks the loop.
   - **Calculate Final Score:** After the loop, the program calculates the final score based on the minimum count and any remaining coins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Card Type:** If there is only one card type (n = 1), the program correctly handles this by simply adding the coins to the count and calculating the score.
   - **No Coins:** If there are no coins (k = 0), the program correctly calculates the score based on the initial counts.
   - **Large Coins:** If the number of coins is large enough to equalize all counts, the program correctly handles this by continuing to the final calculation.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the program and the reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The steps are logically sound and handle the edge cases appropriately.
