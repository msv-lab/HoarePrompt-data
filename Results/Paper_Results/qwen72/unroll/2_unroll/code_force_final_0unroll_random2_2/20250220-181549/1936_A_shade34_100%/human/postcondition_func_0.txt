The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but interacts with the user through standard input. It performs a series of queries to determine two maximum values in a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is an integer provided by the user. For each of `t` test cases (where `1 <= t <= 10^3`), the function identifies the maximum value `mak2` in the permutation and then finds the maximum value among the elements that are equal to `mak2` in the permutation. The function outputs these two values for each test case. After all iterations, `t` remains an integer within its original range, `n` is the last input integer within its range, and `p` remains a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are updated during the function's execution, but their exact final values depend on the specific inputs and the permutation `p`.
