### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( "? a b c d" \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Initial Search for Maximum Element:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \( \text{mak} \) that is likely to be one of the indices with the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_0 \mid p_0) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( (p_0 \mid p_0) < (p_i \mid p_i) \), it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
   - Once \( \text{mak} \) is found, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mak2} \) that, when XORed with \( \text{mak} \), gives a high value.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) < (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \), it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \) and resets \( \text{pans} \) to a list containing \( i \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) = (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \), it appends \( i \) to \( \text{pans} \).

4. **Final Comparison to Find the Maximum XOR:**
   - The program then compares the elements in \( \text{pans} \) to find the index that, when XORed with \( \text{mak2} \), gives the maximum value.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[mak]}) \) with \( (p_{\text{pans}[i]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[i]}) \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( \text{len(pans)}-1 \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[mak]}) > (p_{\text{pans}[i]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[i]}) \), it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \).

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and \( \text{pans}[mak] \) as the answer.

### Analysis:
- **Query Efficiency:**
  - The program uses \( n-1 \) queries to find the initial maximum element.
  - It then uses \( n \) queries to find the second maximum element.
  - Finally, it uses up to \( \text{len(pans)}-1 \) queries to find the maximum XOR.
  - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)}-1) \leq 3n \), which is within the allowed limit.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
  - It then correctly identifies a set of indices that could potentially give the maximum XOR.
  - The final comparison ensures that the maximum XOR is found.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
