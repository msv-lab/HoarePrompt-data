Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `p` remains a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` will have been updated based on the inputs and comparisons made during the loop execution, but their exact values depend on the specific inputs and the permutation `p`. Specifically, `mak2` will be the maximum value found in the first part of the loop, and `pans[mak]` will be the maximum value found in the second part of the loop among the elements that are equal to `mak2` in the permutation `p`.**
