Output State: **`s` will be either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if the loop breaks at index `i`, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if the loop completes. `x` will be either `i` if the loop breaks at index `i`, or `n - 1` if the loop completes. `y` will be the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if it was never true. `t` is 1, and `n` remains unchanged.**
