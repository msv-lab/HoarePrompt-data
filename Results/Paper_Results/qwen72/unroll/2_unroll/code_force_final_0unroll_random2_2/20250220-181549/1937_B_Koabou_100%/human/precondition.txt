The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n` representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should process these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and the number of such paths. The total number of test cases `t` is provided and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
