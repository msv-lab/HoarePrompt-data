The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list containing two strings `a1` and `a2`, each of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
