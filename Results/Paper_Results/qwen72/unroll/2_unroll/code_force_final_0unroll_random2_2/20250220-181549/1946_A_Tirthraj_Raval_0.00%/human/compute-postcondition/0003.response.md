Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. The function `func` has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the count of the middle element in the sorted array `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` have been used within the loop, but their final values are not retained after the loop finishes.**
