You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        res = a.count(a[p])
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. The function `func` has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the count of the middle element in the sorted array `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` have been used within the loop, but their final values are not retained after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided array.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
