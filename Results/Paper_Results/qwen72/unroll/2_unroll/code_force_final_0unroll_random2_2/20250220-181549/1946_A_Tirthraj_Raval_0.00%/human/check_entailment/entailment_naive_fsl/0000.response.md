Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the array and prints that count, which does not address the problem of finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
The current median is 2. The program will count the occurrences of 2 in the array, which is 2, and print 2. However, the correct answer should be 1, as you can increase the first element by 1 to get the array [3, 2, 8], which has a median of 3.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle the problem correctly for this case.
