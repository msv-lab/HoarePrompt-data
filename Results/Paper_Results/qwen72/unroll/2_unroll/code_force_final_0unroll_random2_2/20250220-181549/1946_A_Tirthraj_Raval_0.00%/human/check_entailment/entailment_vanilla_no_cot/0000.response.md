Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the array, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify the current median of the array.
2. Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
3. Calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to the smallest number greater than it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        next_value = math.inf
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] > current_median:
                next_value = a[i]
                break
        if next_value == math.inf:
            print(0)
        else:
            operations = next_value - current_median
            print(operations)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version finds the current median, then looks for the smallest number greater than the current median and calculates the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next value. This ensures that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.
