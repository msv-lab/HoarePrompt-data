Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
