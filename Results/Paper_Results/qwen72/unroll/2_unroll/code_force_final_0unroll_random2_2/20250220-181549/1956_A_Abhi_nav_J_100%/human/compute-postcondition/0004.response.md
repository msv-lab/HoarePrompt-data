The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers where the length of `a` is between 1 and 100, and the integers in `a` are in strictly increasing order, with each integer between 1 and 100. `b` is a list of integers where the length of `b` is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `b` is between 1 and 100.

Case_1: If the operation `a - 1` is attempted, the function returns an error because this operation is not valid on a list of integers.

Case_2: If the operation `a - 1` is not attempted, the function returns the list `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. If an invalid operation `a - 1` is attempted, it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
