Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem. The function `func_1` is overly simplistic and does not account for the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on the sequence `a`. The function `func_1` only checks if `a` (the first element of the sequence) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of players) and returns `a - 1` or `b` based on this condition, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the rounds of the game, removing players at the positions specified by the sequence `a` until no more players can be removed. The number of remaining players after this process should be the output for each `n_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        new_players = []
        for i, player in enumerate(players):
            if (i + 1) not in a:
                new_players.append(player)
        if len(new_players) == len(players):
            break
        players = new_players
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for n_i in n_values:
        print(simulate_game(a, n_i), end=' ')
    print()
```

This version of the program correctly simulates the game for each `n_i` and outputs the number of winners for each case.
