The given print statement is:
```
print('YES')
```

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- For each tuple, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` is also given.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will always print the string 'YES'. The conditions provided do not affect the output of the print statement, as it is a static string and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Output: **YES**
