Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and its value is between 1 and 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are between 1 and 10^18.
- For each tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n` and `k`**:
   - Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `k`.
   - According to the precondition, `n` is always equal to `k`.

2. **Execution of the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `n`.
   - Since `n` is equal to `k` for each tuple, the value of `n` is the same as the value of `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18.
   - The exact value of `n` depends on the specific tuple being processed, but it is always equal to `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and n is equal to k for the current test case)**
