Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 to 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are in the range of 1 to 10^18.
- For each test case, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print('NO')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
