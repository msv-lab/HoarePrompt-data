Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now assigned based on the user input, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.
