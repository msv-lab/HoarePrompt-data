The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
