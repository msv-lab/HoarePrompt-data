The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is read from the input and is expected to be between 1 and 100, the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. Before the loop starts, `i` is implicitly set to 0 by the `range(t)` function, and `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
