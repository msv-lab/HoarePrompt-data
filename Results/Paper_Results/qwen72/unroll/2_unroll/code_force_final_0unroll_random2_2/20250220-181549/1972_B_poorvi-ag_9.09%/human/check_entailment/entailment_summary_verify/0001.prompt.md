You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of coins and their initial states represented by a string of "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to achieve a specific condition and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results` based on the following rules: If the number of coins `n` is even, 'no' is appended. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `results`, one per line. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Winning Condition Analysis:**
   - The program checks if the number of coins `n` is even. If `n` is even, it appends 'no' to the results list. This is because if `n` is even, Bob will always have a move after Alice, and thus Alice cannot force a win.
   - If `n` is odd, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins and 'D' (facing-down) coins.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is greater than the number of 'D' coins, it appends 'yes' to the results list. This is based on the assumption that Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with fewer 'U' coins, eventually leading to a situation where Bob cannot make a move.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'no' to the results list.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results one by one.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Even Number of Coins:**
  - If `n` is even, the game will always end in a draw or a loss for Alice because Bob will always have a move after Alice. This is correctly handled by appending 'no'.

- **Odd Number of Coins:**
  - If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' coins is greater than the number of 'D' coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with fewer 'U' coins. This is a valid strategy and is correctly handled by appending 'yes'.
  - If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' coins is less than or equal to the number of 'D' coins, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with fewer 'U' coins, eventually leading to a situation where Alice cannot make a move. This is correctly handled by appending 'no'.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Coin:**
  - If there is only one coin, the game is trivial. If it is 'U', Alice wins; if it is 'D', Bob wins. The program correctly handles this case by checking the number of 'U' coins.
- **Two Coins:**
  - If there are two coins, the game is also trivial. If both are 'U', Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The program correctly handles this case by checking the number of 'U' coins.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
