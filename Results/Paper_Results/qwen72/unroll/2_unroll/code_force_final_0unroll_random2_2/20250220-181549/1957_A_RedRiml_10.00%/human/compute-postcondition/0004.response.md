Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `w` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka`. It then calculates and prints the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear at least 3 times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (if they exist) remain unchanged, but the value of `w` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. **
