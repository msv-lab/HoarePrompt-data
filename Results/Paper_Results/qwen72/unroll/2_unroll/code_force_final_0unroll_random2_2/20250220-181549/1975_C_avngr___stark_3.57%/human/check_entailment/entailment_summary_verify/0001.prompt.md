You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements in the list `a` and prints this value. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will hold the values from the last test case, and the variable `max` will contain the maximum of the minimum adjacent pairs for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` consisting of positive integers.
   - Mocha can perform an operation where she chooses a subarray and sets all elements of that subarray to the median of the subarray.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum possible value that all elements of the array can be set to after performing these operations.

2. **Analyzing the Operation:**
   - The median of a subarray is the middle element when the subarray is sorted.
   - When the subarray is of odd length, the median is the middle element.
   - When the subarray is of even length, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the final value of the array, Mocha should aim to set the subarray to the highest possible median value.
   - The highest possible median value in any subarray is the maximum value that appears at least twice in the array.
   - If no value appears at least twice, the maximum value will be the smallest value in the array.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided program iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum value of the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements.
   - This approach works because if we can set a subarray to a value, that value must be the median of some subarray.
   - The median of a subarray of length 2 is the minimum of the two elements.
   - By iterating through the array and finding the maximum of these minimum values, we are effectively finding the highest value that can be set as the median of some subarray.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array has only two elements correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the array has more than two elements correctly by considering all pairs of consecutive elements.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value that all elements of the array can be set to after performing the operations. It does so by iterating through the array and finding the maximum of the minimum values of consecutive pairs.
