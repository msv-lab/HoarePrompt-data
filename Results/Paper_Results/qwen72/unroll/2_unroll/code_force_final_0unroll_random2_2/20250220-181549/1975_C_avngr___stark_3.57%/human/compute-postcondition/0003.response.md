The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns the results for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It returns the results for each test case, handling up to 500 test cases in total, with the sum of `n` values not exceeding 10^5.**
