Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of 2n integers. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the program variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the function. **
