The function `func_1` is designed to accept multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Based on the provided information, the function will process each test case and return a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided.**
