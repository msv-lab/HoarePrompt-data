The code defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This lambda function `r` can be used to read multiple integers from a single input line, where the input is split by spaces and each part is converted to an integer. The initial state variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and the queries) are not directly affected by this code, but `r` is now available for use to read inputs.

Output State: **The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` with the following conditions: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities; `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries; and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The lambda function `r` is now defined and can be used to read multiple integers from a single input line.**
