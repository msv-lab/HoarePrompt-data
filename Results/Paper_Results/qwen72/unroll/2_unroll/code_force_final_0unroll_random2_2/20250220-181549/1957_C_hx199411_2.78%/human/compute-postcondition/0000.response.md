Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
