Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given input. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Dynamic Programming Approach:** The function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of ways to form the array `a` that results in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - **Initialization:** The DP array `dp` is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The offset is set to `n` to handle negative indices.
   - **Base Case:** `dp[offset]` is set to 1, representing the initial state where the prefix sum is 0.
   - **DP Transition:** For each element in the array `a`, the function updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums by adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.
   - **Result Calculation:** The final result is obtained by looking up the value in the DP array at the index corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the offset. This value represents the number of ways to form the array `a` that results in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **`func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n` for each test case, and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - **Test Case Processing:** For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - **Output:** After processing all test cases, it prints the results to the console.

**Verification of Correctness:**
- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the function correctly returns 0 because no array `a` can result in a sorted prefix sum array of `[0]`.
  - For `n = 1` and `p = [1]`, the function correctly returns 1 because the only possible array `a` is `[1]`.
  - For `n = 3` and `p = [-1, 1, 2]`, the function correctly returns 0 because no array `a` can result in a sorted prefix sum array of `[-1, 1, 2]`.
  - For `n = 5` and `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the function correctly returns 3 because there are exactly 3 possible arrays `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
  - For `n = 5` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the function correctly returns 1 because the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and `p = [0]` correctly.
  - The function also handles larger values of `n` and `p` within the constraints.

- **Constraints:**
  - The function ensures that the results are computed modulo `998244353`, which is required by the problem statement.
  - The function processes multiple test cases efficiently and correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the problem description and handles all provided test cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
