The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies |p_i| <= n, and the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n).

The function returns a value based on the provided parameters, but the specific return value is not described in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and return a value based on the constraints and relationships between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `n` (an integer between 1 and 5000), and `p` (a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer is between -n and n). The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
