To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case is `res` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. The state of `res` is not something we can adjust directly, as it is assigned by the loop from the elements of `results`. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `res` is the first element in `results`**
