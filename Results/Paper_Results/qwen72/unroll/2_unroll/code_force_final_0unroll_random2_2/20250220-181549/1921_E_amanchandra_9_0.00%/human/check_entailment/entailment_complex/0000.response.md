### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly handles the input format as described in the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading six integers for each test case: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function checks if `x_a > x_b`. If this condition is true, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move her chip to a row above `x_b` (Bob's chip), and Bob cannot move his chip to a row below `x_a` (Alice's chip). This is a correct early exit condition.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This is the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice's chip can potentially meet Bob's chip. It then checks if Alice's chip can move to a column within this range in `x + 1` moves. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This is a correct approach because an odd distance means Alice will have one more move than Bob, giving her the opportunity to win if she can position her chip correctly.

5. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob's chip can potentially meet Alice's chip. It then checks if Bob's chip can move to a column within this range in `x` moves. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This is also correct because an even distance means Bob will have the same number of moves as Alice, and he can win if he can position his chip correctly.

6. **Boundary Conditions**: The function correctly handles the boundary conditions for the board dimensions `h` and `w` by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure the calculated column positions are within the board.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the edge cases and conditions appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
