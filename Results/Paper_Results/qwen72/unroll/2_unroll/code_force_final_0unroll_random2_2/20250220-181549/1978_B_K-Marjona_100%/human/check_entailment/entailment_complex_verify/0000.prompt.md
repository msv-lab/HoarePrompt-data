You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged as they were input for each test case. The loop prints the calculated value for each test case, which is either `a * n` if `b <= a`, or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` where `k = min(n, b - a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b > a` and `k` should be `min(n, b)`. The current implementation sets `k = min(n, b - a)`, which can lead to incorrect results when `b` is significantly larger than `a`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5 15
```
Here, `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 15`. The optimal `k` should be `5` (since `b` is much larger than `a` and `k` can be up to `min(n, b)`), but the program sets `k = min(5, 15 - 5) = 5`. However, the calculation inside the else block is incorrect:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```
This results in:
```
15 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 75 - 10 + 0 = 65
```
The correct profit should be:
```
15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11 = 65
```
However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `b` is much larger than `a` and `k` should be `min(n, b)`. The correct implementation should set `k = min(n, b)` and then calculate the profit accordingly.
