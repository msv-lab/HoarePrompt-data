Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, given the usual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for the first `k` buns. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is because the promotional price can only be applied up to `b - a` times before it becomes less than the usual price `a`.
3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`, resulting in a profit of `a * n`.
4. Otherwise, the profit is calculated as the sum of the promotional prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns. The promotional profit is given by `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun. The usual profit is `a * (n - k)`.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- For `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`:
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct output: 17

- For `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Profit = `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
  - Correct output: 35

- For `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`:
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is 0)
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct output: 100

- For `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
  - Correct output: 45

- For `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`:
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: 1000000000000000000

- For `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`:
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: 1000000000000000000

- For `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`:
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
  - Correct output: 500500

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
