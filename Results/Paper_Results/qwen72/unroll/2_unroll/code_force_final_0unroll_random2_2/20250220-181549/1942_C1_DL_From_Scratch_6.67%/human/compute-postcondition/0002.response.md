Output State: **T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, and the list of x integers contains distinct values from 1 to n. The loop has printed the value of count + x - 2 for each iteration, where count is the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of x integers, plus x - 2.**
