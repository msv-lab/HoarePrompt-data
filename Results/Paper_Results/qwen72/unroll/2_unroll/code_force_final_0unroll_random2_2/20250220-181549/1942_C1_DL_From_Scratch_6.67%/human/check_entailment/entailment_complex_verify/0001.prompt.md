You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

The loop has printed the value of count + x - 2 for each iteration, where count is the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of x integers, plus x - 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, where `n` is the upper bound of a range of integers, `x` is the number of distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`, and `y` is always 0. It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers from the input, sorts this list, and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function prints the sum of this count and `x - 2` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function has printed the calculated value for each test case, and the state of the program remains as described in the initial state, with the exception that the input has been consumed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We need to form non-intersecting diagonals using these vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.
   - \( y = 0 \) means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The number of triangles that can be formed by non-intersecting diagonals in a polygon is related to the number of vertices chosen and the gaps between them.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. Each gap of size 1 can form one additional triangle.
   - It also checks the gap between the last chosen vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Finally, it prints the total number of triangles, which is the sum of the gaps of size 1 and \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the gaps of size 1 between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the polygon. Specifically, the gap between the last and the first vertex is not considered properly.
   - The formula \( x - 2 \) is used to count the initial set of triangles that can be formed by the chosen vertices, but this is only valid if the chosen vertices are consecutive or form a single chain of triangles.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using vertices that are not directly adjacent but still form non-intersecting diagonals.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \):
     - The sorted vertices are \( 1, 2, 5, 6 \).
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), \( 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 \), \( 6 - 5 - 1 = 0 \).
     - Cyclic gap: \( 8 - 6 + 1 - 1 = 2 \).
     - The program counts 1 gap of size 1, but it should count 2 gaps of size 1 and the cyclic gap.
   - For the test case \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \):
     - The sorted vertices are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \).
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), \( 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 \), \( 4 - 3 - 1 = 0 \), \( 5 - 4 - 1 = 0 \), \( 6 - 5 - 1 = 0 \), \( 7 - 6 - 1 = 0 \), \( 8 - 7 - 1 = 0 \).
     - Cyclic gap: \( 8 - 8 + 1 - 1 = 0 \).
     - The program correctly counts 6 triangles.
   - For the test case \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 3 \):
     - The sorted vertices are \( 1, 3 \).
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 \).
     - Cyclic gap: \( 4 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 1 \).
     - The program correctly counts 2 triangles.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the polygon and the formation of triangles using non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
