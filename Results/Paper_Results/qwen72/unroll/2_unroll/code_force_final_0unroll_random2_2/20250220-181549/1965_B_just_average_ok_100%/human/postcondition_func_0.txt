The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. The function then modifies a list `nums` which initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to 2^20. It removes one element from `nums` and adds three new elements based on the value of `k`. Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
