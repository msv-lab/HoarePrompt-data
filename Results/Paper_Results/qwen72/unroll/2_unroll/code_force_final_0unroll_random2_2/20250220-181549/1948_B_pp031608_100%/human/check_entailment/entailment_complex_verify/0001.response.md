### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   - It then iterates over the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if the previous element can be split into its digits to make the array sorted.
   - The digits of `arr[i-1]` are extracted and combined with `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - The list `nums` is then checked if it is sorted. If it is not sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the array can be made sorted, the previous element `arr[i-1]` is replaced with the first digit of `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The function attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and combine them with `arr[i]` to form `nums`.
  - However, the logic for splitting and inserting the digits is flawed. The digits should be inserted in the same position as the original element, not combined with the next element.
  - For example, if `arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]`, and we split `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array should become `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, not `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

- **Sorting Check**:
  - The function checks if `nums` is sorted, but this is not the correct way to determine if the array can be made sorted by the given operation.
  - The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.
  - The current logic only checks if the digits of `arr[i-1]` combined with `arr[i]` are sorted, which is not sufficient to ensure the entire array can be made sorted.

### Correct Approach:
- **Correct Splitting**:
  - When an element is split, its digits should be inserted in the same position as the original element.
- **Correct Sorting Check**:
  - The function should check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to split elements and check if the array can be made sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
