Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and checking process for the array to be sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically:

1. The program attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` and then checks if the resulting list of digits plus the next element is sorted. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or the correct order of the entire array after all possible splits.

2. The program only checks the immediate next element after a split, which is insufficient. It needs to ensure that the entire array can be sorted after all necessary splits.

3. The logic for updating `arr[i - 1]` is incorrect. It should be replaced by the digits of the split element, not just the first digit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_array():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                # Try to split arr[i] and check if it can be sorted
                nums = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                if len(nums) == 1 or nums[-1] > arr[i + 1]:
                    ans = False
                    break
                # Replace arr[i] with its digits
                arr = arr[:i] + nums + arr[i + 1:]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

# Example usage:
# can_sort_array()
```

This corrected version properly splits the elements and checks if the entire array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after all necessary splits.
