### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   - It then iterates over the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if the previous element can be split into its digits to make the array sorted.
   - The digits of `arr[i-1]` are extracted and combined with `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - The list `nums` is then checked if it is sorted. If it is not sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the array can be made sorted, the previous element `arr[i-1]` is replaced with the first digit of `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The function attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and combine them with `arr[i]` to form `nums`.
  - However, the logic for splitting and inserting the digits is flawed. The digits should be inserted in the same position as the original element, not combined with the next element.
  - For example, if `arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]`, and we split `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array should become `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, not `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

- **Sorting Check**:
  - The function checks if `nums` is sorted, but this is not the correct way to determine if the array can be made sorted by the given operation.
  - The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` (2 ≤ m ≤ 50) and a list of `m` integers `arr` (0 ≤ arr_i ≤ 99).
- For each test case, it checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself.
- If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The function does not return any value, but the variables `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The function's approach to splitting and inserting digits is incorrect. It should split the element into its digits and insert them in the same position, not combine them with the next element.
  - The provided logic does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in the array.

- **Incorrect Sorting Check**:
  - The function checks if the combined list `nums` is sorted, which is not the correct way to determine if the array can be made sorted by the given operation.
  - The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to split elements and check if the array can be made sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
