#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should handle the input and output as described in the problem statement.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, processing `n` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. It then checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variable `n` will be unchanged, and the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` (2 ≤ m ≤ 50) and a list of `m` integers `arr` (0 ≤ arr_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `n` will be unchanged, and the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.
