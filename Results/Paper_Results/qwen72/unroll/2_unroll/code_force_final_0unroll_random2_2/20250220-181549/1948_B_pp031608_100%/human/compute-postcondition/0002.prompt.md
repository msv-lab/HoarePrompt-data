Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The variable `n` is now an integer value provided by the user, and the function is still expected to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
