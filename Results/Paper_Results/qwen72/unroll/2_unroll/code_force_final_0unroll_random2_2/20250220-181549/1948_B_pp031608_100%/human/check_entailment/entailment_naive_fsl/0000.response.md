Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and then re-evaluating the entire array to check if it can be sorted. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the program fails for the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
3
10 20 30
```

**Output:**
```
NO
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

In this case, the array can be transformed to `[1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program does not correctly handle this case because it only checks the immediate neighbors and does not consider the possibility of splitting elements and re-evaluating the entire array.
