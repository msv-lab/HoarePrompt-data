The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function likely accepts these parameters internally or through another method (e.g., global variables, input within the function body).

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function is expected to return a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the example, so we can only describe the parameters and the general context.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
