The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). It then computes a value `t` based on the conditions inside the loop and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the computed `t` for each of the `n` test cases. After the function concludes, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed values of `t` for each test case.
