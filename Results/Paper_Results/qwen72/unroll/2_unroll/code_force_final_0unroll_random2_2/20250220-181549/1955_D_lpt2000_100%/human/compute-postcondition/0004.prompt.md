You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, and an integer `k`. `a` has length `n`, `b` has length `m`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)
        
    #State: The variable `fnd` contains the total number of times the number of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and `bb` was greater than or equal to `k` during the entire process of sliding the window of size `m` over the list `aa`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`, `E`, and `C` are updated as the loop processes each test case, but their final values depend on the specific input and the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `k`, and an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes the lists `a` and `b` with the integer `k` and returns a result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
