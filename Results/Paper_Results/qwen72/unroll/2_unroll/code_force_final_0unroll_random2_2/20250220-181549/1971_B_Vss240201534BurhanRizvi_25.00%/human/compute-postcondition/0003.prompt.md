You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to take a string `s` as an input parameter, where `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user. For each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the user, create a shuffled version `s2` of that string, and print 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it will print 'No'. The state of the variables `s` and `s2` will be updated for each iteration, but the final state of these variables after the loop finishes will be the values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters and returns a value based on the input string `s`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
