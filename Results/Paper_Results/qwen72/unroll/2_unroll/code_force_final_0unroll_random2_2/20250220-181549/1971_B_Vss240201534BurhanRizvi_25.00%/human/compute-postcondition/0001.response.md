Output State: **The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user. For each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the user, create a shuffled version `s2` of that string, and print 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it will print 'No'. The state of the variables `s` and `s2` will be updated for each iteration, but the final state of these variables after the loop finishes will be the values from the last iteration.**
