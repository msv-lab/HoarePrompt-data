Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the total cost. Specifically, the variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid initialization for the total cost. Additionally, the formula used to update `c` inside the loop (`c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`) is incorrect and does not account for the increasing prices due to ticket purchases.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        for price in l:
            if tickets_bought >= k:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + tickets_to_buy - 1) * tickets_to_buy // 2
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version initializes `total_cost` to 0 and iterates through the sorted list of prices, buying the maximum number of tickets possible each day while updating the total cost correctly. The formula `tickets_to_buy * (price + tickets_to_buy - 1) * tickets_to_buy // 2` correctly accounts for the increasing prices due to the tickets bought on that day.
