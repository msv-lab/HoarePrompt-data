### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `l` for the `n` days.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list `l` in ascending order. This is a good approach because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will minimize the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which is not used correctly in the loop. This initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. This initialization does not make sense in the context of the problem and seems to be a mistake. The correct initialization should be `c = 0`.

4. **Loop to Purchase Tickets**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list `l`.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to `min(m, k)`, which is the number of tickets to buy on the current day. This is correct because it ensures that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day or more than needed.
   - `k` is then decreased by `s`, which is correct as it keeps track of the remaining tickets to be bought.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This is incorrect. The correct update should be `c += l[i] * s` to reflect the actual cost of buying `s` tickets at the price `l[i]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `c` for each test case. However, due to the incorrect initialization and update of `c`, the output will be incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has issues with the initialization of `c` and the update formula for `c`. The corrected program provided in the original assessment is the correct approach to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
