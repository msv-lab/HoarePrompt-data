The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `t`, a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases; `(n, k)` pairs, where each pair consists of integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices `n` and a specific vertex `k` in each test case; and `adj`, a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to the tree structure and the given vertex `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a tree with `n` vertices and a specific vertex `k`, and returns a result for each test case based on the adjacency list of the tree and the given vertex `k`.**
