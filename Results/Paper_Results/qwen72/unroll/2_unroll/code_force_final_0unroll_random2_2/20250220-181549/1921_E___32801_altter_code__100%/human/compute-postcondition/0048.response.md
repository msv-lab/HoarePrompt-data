Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Conditions:
1. If `y2` <= `y1`:
   - `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.
   - `y2` is 1.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `c` is `y1 - 1`.

2. Otherwise, if `y2` > `y1`:
   - `y1` is `r[3] + 1 + a`.
   - `y2` is equal to `m`.
   - `a` is `r[1] - y2`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `c` is `m - y1`.

### Additional Conditions:
- Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1` is not in the range 1 to `m` inclusive, or `x1` is not in the range 1 to `n` inclusive.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `x1` and `x2`**:
   - `x1 = r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2 = r[4] - a`
   - `b = x2 - x1`
   - `x2 > x1`
   - `x1 >= 1`
   - `x2 <= n`
   - `b` is even.

2. **Determine `y1` and `y2`**:
   - If `y2 <= y1`:
     - `y1 = r[3] - 1`
     - `y2 = 1`
     - `a = 0`
     - `t = abs(y2 - y1) = abs(1 - (r[3] - 1)) = r[3] - 2`
     - `c = y1 - 1 = (r[3] - 1) - 1 = r[3] - 2`
   - If `y2 > y1`:
     - `y1 = r[3] + 1 + a`
     - `y2 = m`
     - `a = r[1] - y2 = r[1] - m`
     - `t = abs(y2 - y1) = abs(m - (r[3] + 1 + a)) = abs(m - (r[3] + 1 + (r[1] - m))) = abs(m - r[3] - 1 - r[1] + m) = abs(2m - r[3] - 1 - r[1])`
     - `c = m - y1 = m - (r[3] + 1 + a) = m - (r[3] + 1 + (r[1] - m)) = m - r[3] - 1 - r[1] + m = 2m - r[3] - 1 - r[1]`

3. **Check the Additional Conditions**:
   - `b // 2 <= a`
   - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
   - `y1` is not in the range 1 to `m` inclusive
   - `x1` is not in the range 1 to `n` inclusive

Given the complexity of the conditions and the fact that the `print('draw')` statement is a simple string literal, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of the variables.

### Output:
Output: **draw**
