Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `x1` is `r[2] + 1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` was initially an odd number, but after incrementing `x1` by 1, the difference becomes an even number.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
