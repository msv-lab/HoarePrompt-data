Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is no expression or variable being returned; the `return` statement is empty, which means the function will return `None` by default in Python. However, since the task specifies to describe the information we have for any variable or value included in the return, and there is none, the program effectively does not return any specific value.
