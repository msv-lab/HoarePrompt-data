Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. The input should be structured as multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, where `1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6`, `1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a \ne x_b` or `y_a \ne y_b`.**

Here is the corrected function definition based on the problem description:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b
    pass
```
