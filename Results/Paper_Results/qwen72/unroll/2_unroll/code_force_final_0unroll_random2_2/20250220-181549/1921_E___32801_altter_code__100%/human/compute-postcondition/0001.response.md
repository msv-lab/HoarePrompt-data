Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.** 

The values of `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been updated to the corresponding values from the list `r`. The list `r` contains six integers representing the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` for the current test case. The initial state of `r` being a list of six integers is still valid.
