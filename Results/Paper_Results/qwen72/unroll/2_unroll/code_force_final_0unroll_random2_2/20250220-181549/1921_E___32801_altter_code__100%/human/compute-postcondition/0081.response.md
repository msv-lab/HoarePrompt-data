Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
2. `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
3. `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`.
4. `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
5. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
6. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
7. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
8. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
9. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1 - a`.
10. `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
11. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
12. If `y1` <= `y2`, then:
    - `y1` is 1.
    - `y2` is `r[5] - a`.
    - `c` is equal to `y2 - 1`.
13. Otherwise:
    - `y1` is `m`.
    - `y2` is `r[5] + a`.
    - `c` is equal to `m - y2`.
14. Additionally, one of the following conditions must be true:
    - `b // 2 <= a`
    - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
    - `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
    - `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

### Analysis:
- The `print('draw')` statement will always print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables.
- The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. They are used to set up the context and constraints for the program, but the `print` statement itself is a simple output of a constant string.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
