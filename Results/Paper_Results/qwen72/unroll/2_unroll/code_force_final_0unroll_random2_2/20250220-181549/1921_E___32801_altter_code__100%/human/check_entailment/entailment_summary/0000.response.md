### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads six integers from the input, representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip (`x2 <= x1`). If so, it prints 'draw' because Bob cannot move up to capture Alice's chip, and Alice cannot move down to capture Bob's chip.

3. **Odd and Even Turn Differences:**
   - The program differentiates between the cases where the difference in the x-coordinates (`x2 - x1`) is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it checks if Alice can win by moving her chip to the same column as Bob's chip. If the y-coordinates are the same (`y1 == y2`), Alice wins.
   - If the y-coordinates are not the same, it simulates Alice moving her chip diagonally to try to align with Bob's chip. If she can align, she wins. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of moves Alice can make without going out of bounds and checks if Bob can still win or if it results in a draw.

4. **Even Turn Differences:**
   - If the difference in the x-coordinates is even, it checks if Bob can win by moving his chip to the same column as Alice's chip. If the y-coordinates are the same (`y1 == y2`), Bob wins.
   - If the y-coordinates are not the same, it simulates Bob moving his chip diagonally to try to align with Alice's chip. If he can align, he wins. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of moves Bob can make without going out of bounds and checks if Alice can still win or if it results in a draw.

5. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program ensures that the chips do not move out of the board's boundaries by checking the conditions `1 <= y1 <= m` and `1 <= x1 <= n` after each move simulation.

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program assumes both players play optimally, meaning they will always choose the move that leads to a win if possible. This is reflected in the logic that checks for alignment and the number of moves required to achieve a win.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the game logic and boundary conditions as described in the problem. It correctly determines the outcome of the game for each test case based on the initial positions of the chips and the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
