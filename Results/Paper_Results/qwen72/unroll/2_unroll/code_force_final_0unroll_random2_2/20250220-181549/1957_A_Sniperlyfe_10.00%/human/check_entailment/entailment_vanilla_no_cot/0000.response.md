Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only considers the possibility of forming squares (4-sided polygons) from the sticks. However, the problem statement asks for the maximum number of regular polygons (which can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3) that can be formed. The program should account for all possible regular polygons, not just squares.

To correct this, the program should iterate over all possible polygon side counts (from 3 upwards) and calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each side count, then sum these values to get the total maximum number of polygons.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, v + 1):
            max_polygons += v // sides
    
    return max_polygons
```

This version of `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by considering all possible side counts for each stick length.
