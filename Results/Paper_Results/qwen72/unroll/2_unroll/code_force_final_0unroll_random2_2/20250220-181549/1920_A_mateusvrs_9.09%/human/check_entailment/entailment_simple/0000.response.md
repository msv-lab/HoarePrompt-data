### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number and `bx` to -1. These variables are used to track the maximum lower bound and the minimum upper bound for `k`, respectively.
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` if the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), and updates `ax` if the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and counting the elements that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints each result in the list `r` on a new line, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic for updating the bounds and excluding specific values is sound and aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
