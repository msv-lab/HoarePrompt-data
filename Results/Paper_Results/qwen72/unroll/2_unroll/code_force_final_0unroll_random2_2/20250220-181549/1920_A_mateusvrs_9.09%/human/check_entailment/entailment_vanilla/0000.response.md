### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints, each consisting of two integers `a` and `x`.

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - If `a == 1`, this means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. The function updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, this means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. The function updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, this means `k` must not be equal to `x`. The function adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k` (since `k` must be both greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`), and the function appends `0` to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx < ax`, the function calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` which is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints each result in the list `r` on a new line.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which ensures that any valid upper bound constraint will be less than this initial value.
  - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which ensures that any valid lower bound constraint will be greater than this initial value.

- **Processing Constraints**:
  - For `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`, ensuring that `k` must be at least `bx`.
  - For `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`, ensuring that `k` must be at most `ax`.
  - For `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` must not be equal to any of these values.

- **Range Check**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, it means the range is invalid, and the function correctly appends `0` to the result list.

- **Counting Valid Integers**:
  - The function correctly calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
  - It then iterates over the set `cx` to count how many of these integers are in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It follows the problem description and produces the expected output.

### Correctness:
