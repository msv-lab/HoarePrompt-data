Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a set of unique constraints. For each test case, it determines the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx`. The function then prints each result on a new line. The final state of the program is that `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers for the corresponding test case, and the length of `r` is equal to the number of test cases `t`. **
