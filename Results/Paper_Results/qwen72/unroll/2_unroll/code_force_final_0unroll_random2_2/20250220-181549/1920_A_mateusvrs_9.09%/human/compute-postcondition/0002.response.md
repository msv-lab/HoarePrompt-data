The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `r` is an empty list, `_` is a placeholder**
