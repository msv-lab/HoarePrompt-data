The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will operate with a number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns different outputs based on the constraints provided:
- Case_1: If the constraints are processed and a specific condition is met, the function returns a result based on the constraints.
- Case_2: If the constraints are processed and a different condition is met, the function returns a different result based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each with a set of unique constraints (a, x), and returns results based on the conditions specified by these constraints.**
