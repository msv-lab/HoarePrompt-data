The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where 0 <= `times` <= len(arr)). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. This ensures the index is within the bounds of the list, and the returned value is the result of subtracting the element at this index from the last element of the list.
