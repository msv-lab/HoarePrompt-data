Output State: **`test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` are not affected.**

In natural language: The variable `test_cases` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_1()`. All other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
