You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Therefore, after all iterations, these variables will not retain any specific final state from the last iteration, but the `max_profit` for each test case will be printed. The variables `test_cases` and any other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`) using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The program creates a list `combined` where each element is a tuple of the negative price for Alice and the price for Bob.
   - This list is sorted based on the price for Bob (`item[1]`).

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - A heap `heap` is initialized to store the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - A list `remaining_items` is initialized to store the remaining items that Alice might buy.

4. **Heap Population**:
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from `combined` into the heap.
   - This ensures that Bob will take the `k` items with the highest Bob prices for free.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit for Alice by summing up the Bob prices of the items in the heap and adding the profit from the remaining items.
   - The profit from the remaining items is calculated by adding `item[0] + item[1]` (i.e., the difference between Bob's price and Alice's price) if it is non-negative.

6. **Optimization Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the remaining items in `combined`.
   - For each item, it updates the current profit by subtracting the Bob price if the combined profit is non-negative, or adding the negative Alice price if the combined profit is negative.
   - It then pushes the current item into the heap and pops the smallest item from the heap (i.e., the item with the smallest negative Alice price).
   - The profit is adjusted by subtracting the negative Alice price of the removed item.
   - The maximum profit is updated if the current profit is greater than the maximum profit.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies the `k` items with the highest Bob prices to be taken for free by Bob.
  - It then calculates the profit for the remaining items by considering the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices.
  - The optimization loop ensures that Alice's profit is maximized by dynamically adjusting the items in the heap and the remaining items.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 (i.e., Bob takes no items for free) correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` (i.e., Bob takes all items for free) correctly.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently manages the `k` items with the highest Bob prices.
  - The sorting step and the heap operations are both efficient, making the program suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
