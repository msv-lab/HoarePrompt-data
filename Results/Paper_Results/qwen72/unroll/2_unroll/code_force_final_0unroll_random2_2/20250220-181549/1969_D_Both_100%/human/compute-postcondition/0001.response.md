The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, which is determined by `test_cases`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `_` will start at 0 (though its value is not used).

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
