Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same and the number of outcomes is greater than 1. For example, consider the input:

```
2
3
3 3 3
```

The program will calculate the product of the multipliers as \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\). Then, it will set each bet as \(27 \div 3 = 9\). The sum of the bets will be \(9 + 9 + 9 = 27\), which is equal to the product. According to the problem description, the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, in this case, the sum of the bets is equal to the product, and the program will incorrectly print the bets instead of \(-1\).

This violates the requirement that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
