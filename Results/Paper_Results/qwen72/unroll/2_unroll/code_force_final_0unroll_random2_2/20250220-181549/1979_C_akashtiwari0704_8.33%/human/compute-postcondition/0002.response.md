Output State: **The variable `T` will have the value `t-1` after the loop finishes all iterations. The list `a` will contain the calculated bets for the last test case, or -1 if no valid distribution is possible. The variable `prod` will hold the product of the multipliers for the last test case. The variable `sumo` will hold the sum of the calculated bets for the last test case. The variable `ans` will contain the string representation of the bets for the last test case, or an empty string if the last test case resulted in -1. The variable `bets` will hold the number of outcomes for the last test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.**
