The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should return a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It returns a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome for each test case, or -1 if no such distribution is possible.**
