The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This likely represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. This likely represents the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list `a`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on typical problem statements, the function is likely to process the list `a` in some way and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times). The function processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case.**
