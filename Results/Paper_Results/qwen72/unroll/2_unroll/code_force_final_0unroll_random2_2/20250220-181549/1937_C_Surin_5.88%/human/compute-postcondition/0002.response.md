The only object in the loop head is the variable `kp`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer, and `kp` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
