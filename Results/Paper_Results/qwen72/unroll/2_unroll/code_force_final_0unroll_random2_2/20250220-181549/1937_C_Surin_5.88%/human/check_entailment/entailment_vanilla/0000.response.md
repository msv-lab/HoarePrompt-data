### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - Each query compares \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses a two-step approach:
     1. **Finding the Maximum Value:**
        - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_0 \mid p_0) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
        - If \( (p_0 \mid p_0) < (p_i \mid p_i) \), it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).
        - This step ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
     2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
        - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \).
        - If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).
        - This step ensures that \( prev \) is the index of the value that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result.

3. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \( n-1 \) times, and each iteration makes one query.
   - The second loop also runs \( n-1 \) times, and each iteration makes one query.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - The program prints the result in the correct format and flushes the output after each query and the final answer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the two indices and print the result.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem constraints. It uses a valid approach to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
