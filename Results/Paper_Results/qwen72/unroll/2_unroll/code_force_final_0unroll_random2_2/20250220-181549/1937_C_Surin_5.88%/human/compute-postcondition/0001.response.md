Output State: **The function `I` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads an integer from the input. The initial state conditions remain unchanged: the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
