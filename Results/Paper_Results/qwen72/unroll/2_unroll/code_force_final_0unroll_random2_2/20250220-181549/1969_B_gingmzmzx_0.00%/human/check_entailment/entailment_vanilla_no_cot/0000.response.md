Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **String Processing**: The string `s` is converted into a list of integers, which is a valid step since the string consists only of '0's and '1's.

3. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the number of '0's in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is '0', it increments the count of '0's in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one '1' encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is '1', it increments the count of '1's in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining '0's that need to be moved to the left (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

5. **Output**: After processing each string, the program prints the total cost `ans`.

The logic of the program is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost is calculated based on the number of '0's and '1's and their positions, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and efficiently, ensuring that the sum of the lengths of the strings does not exceed the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
