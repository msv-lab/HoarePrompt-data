The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, converts it to a list of integers, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of the number of '1's that appear before each '0' and the number of '0's that appear after each '1'. After computing `ans` for each test case, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
