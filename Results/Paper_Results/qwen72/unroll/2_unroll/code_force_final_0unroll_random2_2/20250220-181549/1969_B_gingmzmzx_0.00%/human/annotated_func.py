#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided in the input, and the sum of the lengths of all strings across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, count the number of '0's in the string, and then compute a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. After each iteration, the value of `ans` will be printed, and the variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset for the next iteration. The variable `n` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, and the loop will terminate when `n` reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, converts it to a list of integers, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of the number of '1's that appear before each '0' and the number of '0's that appear after each '1'. After computing `ans` for each test case, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
