Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided in the input, and the sum of the lengths of all strings across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, count the number of '0's in the string, and then compute a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. After each iteration, the value of `ans` will be printed, and the variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset for the next iteration. The variable `n` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, and the loop will terminate when `n` reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, converts it to a list of integers, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of the number of '1's that appear before each '0' and the number of '0's that appear after each '1'. After computing `ans` for each test case, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
