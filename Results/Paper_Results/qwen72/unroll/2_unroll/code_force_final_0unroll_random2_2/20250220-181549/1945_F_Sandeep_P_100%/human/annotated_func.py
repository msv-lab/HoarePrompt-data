#State of the program right berfore the function call: magic_powers is a list of integers where 1 <= len(magic_powers) <= 200,000 and 1 <= magic_powers[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(magic_powers). permutation is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to len(magic_powers).
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function`. It does not modify any input parameters or have any side effects on the program state. The purpose of the function is to provide a decorator that can be used to return a specified fill value for recursive calls.
