You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function should be called in a loop or similar structure to process each test case.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed `n` test cases, where for each test case: if the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s` depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order or not. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated for each iteration based on the current string `s`, but their values will not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. However, the function itself does not accept any parameters. It should be called in a loop or similar structure to handle each test case, and the output for each test case should be determined based on the string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
