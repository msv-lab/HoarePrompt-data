Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` which is initially set to `n`. For each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
