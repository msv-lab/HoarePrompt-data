Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the loop where `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`:
- The valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
- The program will incorrectly calculate the number of valid pairs as follows:
  - For `b = 1`, `ans = ans + (2 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 2 + 3 = 5`.
  - For `b = 2`, `ans = ans + (2 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 5 + 1 = 6`.
  - For `b = 3`, `ans = ans + (2 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 6 + 0 = 6`.

The program outputs 6, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
