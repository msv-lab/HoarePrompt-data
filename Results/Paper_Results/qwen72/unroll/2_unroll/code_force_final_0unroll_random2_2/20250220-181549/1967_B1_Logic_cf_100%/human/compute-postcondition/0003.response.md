The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a pair of positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and the sum of `a` and `b` is a multiple of `b` times the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a pair of positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and returns the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b · gcd(a, b).**
