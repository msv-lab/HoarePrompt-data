Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation in the provided program does not correctly solve this problem. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs should start at 0, not `n`. The value `n` is the upper limit for `a`, but it does not represent the initial count of valid pairs.

2. **Inner Loop Calculation**:
   - The inner loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. For each `b`, it increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This calculation is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs an integer division that does not reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be expressed as:
     \[
     (a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0
     \]
   - The provided program does not implement this condition.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output should be 14, as listed in the example. However, the provided program will not produce this output because it is not correctly counting the valid pairs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
