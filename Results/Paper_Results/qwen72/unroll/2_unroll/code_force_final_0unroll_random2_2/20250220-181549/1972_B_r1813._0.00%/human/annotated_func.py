#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: The `index` is `t * 2 + 1`. The `results` list contains `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The `data` list remains unchanged. The `t` variable remains the same as its initial value.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` is `t * 2 + 1`. The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The `data` list remains unchanged. The `t` variable remains the same as its initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd and appends 'YES' to the results list if it is, otherwise appends 'NO'. Finally, the function prints each element of the results list, which contains `t` elements, each being 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
