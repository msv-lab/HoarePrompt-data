You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `k` are unchanged for each iteration of the loop, but the loop prints the length of the `ans` list and the elements of the `ans` list for each test case `t`. The `ans` list is recalculated for each test case, so the final state of `n`, `k`, and `t` remains the same as the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function calculates a list `ans` containing specific integers derived from `k` and prints the length of this list followed by the elements of the list. The values of `n` and `k` are unchanged for each test case, and the function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the same as the initial state, except for the output that has been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, the sequence generated by the program may not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k` while still allowing for subsequences with sums of all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`).

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```

The program generates the sequence:
```
[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)] + [1 << j for j in range(20) if j != i]
```

For `k = 3`, the value of `i` is 1 (since `1 << 1 = 2` and `2 < 3` but `1 << 2 = 4` which is greater than 3). Therefore, the sequence generated is:
```
[3 - 2, 3 + 1, 3 + 1 + 2] + [1, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...] (excluding 2)
```
This simplifies to:
```
[1, 4, 6] + [1, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...] (excluding 2)
```

The final sequence is:
```
[1, 4, 6, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...]
```

However, this sequence contains multiple 1s and 4s, which can form a subsequence with a sum of 3 (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 2]`), violating the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input, and the correctness is **False**.
