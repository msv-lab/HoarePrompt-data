Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify if it satisfies the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The program calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` using a while loop. This is stored in `i`, where `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence `ans` with three initial elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that the sum of any subsequence of `ans` will not be exactly `k` because this element is chosen to be less than `k` and not a power of 2.
     - `k + 1`: This is a value greater than `k` and ensures that `k` is not a sum of any subsequence.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This is another value greater than `k` and ensures that `k` is not a sum of any subsequence.
   - The program then appends all powers of 2 up to `2^20` to the sequence `ans`, except for `2^i` (which is `1 << i`).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans`.
   - It then prints the elements of the sequence `ans`.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` should have a sum of `k`.**
  - The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`. The initial elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen such that they do not form a subsequence summing to `k`.
  - The powers of 2 added to `ans` (except `2^i`) are chosen to ensure that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`.

- **Condition 2: For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.**
  - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 up to `2^20` except `2^i`. This allows for the construction of any sum up to `2^21 - 1` (which is much larger than `10^6`).
  - By including `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, the program ensures that all values from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a sum of some subsequence of `ans`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sequence `ans` is constructed to meet the conditions for all valid inputs.

### Final State:
- The final state of the program is consistent with the initial state, as `n` and `k` are read and processed for each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
