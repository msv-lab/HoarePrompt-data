### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` has a sum equal to `k`.
     - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v ≠ k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` whose sum is `v`.
   - The sequence `a` should have at most 25 elements.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by using a while loop. This is stored in `1 << i`.
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - The program then appends all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` (20 elements) to `ans`, except for `1 << i`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **No subsequence with sum `k`:**
     - The sequence `ans` is constructed such that it includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, but not `1 << i` itself.
     - This ensures that no combination of the elements in `ans` can sum up to `k` because the missing `1 << i` is crucial for forming `k`.
   - **Subsequences for all `v` in `[1, n]` where `v ≠ k`:**
     - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` (except `1 << i`), which can be used to form any sum up to `2^20 - 1` (which is much larger than `10^6`).
     - Additionally, the sequence includes `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, which helps in forming sums greater than `k`.
     - The element `k - (1 << i)` ensures that sums less than `k` can be formed by combining it with the powers of 2.

4. **Sequence Length:**
   - The sequence `ans` has at most 23 elements (3 initial elements + 20 powers of 2 - 1 excluded power of 2), which is within the limit of 25 elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
