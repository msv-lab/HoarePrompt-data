### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts it from `k` to get the first element of the sequence.
   - It adds `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` to the sequence.
   - It appends all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` to the sequence, except the power of 2 that was used to compute the first element.

3. **Analysis:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - The first element `k - (1 << i)` is chosen such that it is less than `k` and does not contribute to a subsequence sum of `k`.
     - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen to be greater than `k`, ensuring they cannot be part of a subsequence sum of `k`.
     - The remaining elements are powers of 2, which are chosen to cover all possible sums up to `2^19 - 1` (which is `524287`), ensuring that all other values in the range `[1, n]` can be formed by some subsequence.
   - **All Other Values in the Range `[1, n]` Can Be Formed:**
     - The sequence `ans` is constructed to include all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except the one used to compute the first element. This ensures that any integer in the range `[1, 524287]` can be formed by a subsequence of these powers of 2.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in covering values greater than `k` and ensuring that the sequence can form any value in the range `[1, n]` except `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **When `k` is a Power of 2:**
     - If `k` is a power of 2, the first element `k - (1 << i)` will be `0`. This is valid because `0` is a non-negative integer and does not contribute to a subsequence sum of `k`.
   - **When `n` is Small:**
     - For small values of `n`, the sequence `ans` will still be valid because the powers of 2 and the additional elements will cover all values in the range `[1, n]` except `k`.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Example 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
     - The sequence `[1]` is correct because it has a subsequence that sums to `1` but not to `2`.
   - **Example 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
     - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct because it has subsequences that sum to `2, 3, 4, 5, 6` but not to `1`.
   - **Example 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
     - The sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct because it has subsequences that sum to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7` but not to `8`.
   - **Example 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
     - The sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` is correct because it has subsequences that sum to `1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` but not to `3`.
   - **Example 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
     - The sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct because it has subsequences that sum to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10` but not to `7`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other values in the range `[1, n]` can be formed by some subsequence. The size of the sequence is at most 25, which meets the problem's constraint.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
