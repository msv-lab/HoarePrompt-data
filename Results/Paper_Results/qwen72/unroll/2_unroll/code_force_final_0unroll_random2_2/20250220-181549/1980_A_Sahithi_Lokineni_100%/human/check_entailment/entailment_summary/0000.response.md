Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one in a loop.

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). However, there is a minor issue in the initialization. The `default_value` function is not defined, and the dictionary should be initialized with a default value of 0 for each key. This is fixed by explicitly setting the values to 0 for each key.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the count of each difficulty level in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Calculating Missing Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a difficulty level in the dictionary is less than or equal to the number of rounds `m`, it adds the difference `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

6. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue in the dictionary initialization. The `default_value` function should be replaced with a direct initialization of the dictionary with default values of 0.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with default value 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Iterate over the specific keys
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)

def func_1():
    return 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The dictionary `d` is initialized with `defaultdict(int)` to ensure that any key that is not present in the dictionary will have a default value of 0.
- The loop for calculating the missing problems iterates over the specific keys 'A' to 'G' to ensure that all difficulty levels are considered.

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.
