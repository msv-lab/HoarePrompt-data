Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it uses an undefined function `default_value` in the `defaultdict` initialization. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is to use `int` as the default factory, not `default_value`. Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected here
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases. However, since the original program contains this error, it is considered incorrect.
