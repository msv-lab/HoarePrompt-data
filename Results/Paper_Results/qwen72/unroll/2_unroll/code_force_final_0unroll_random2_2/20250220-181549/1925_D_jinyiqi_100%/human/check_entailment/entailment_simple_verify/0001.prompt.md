You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, then reads `m` lines of input for `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It calculates `p` and `q` based on these inputs, simplifies the fraction `p/q` using the greatest common divisor, and prints the result of `(p * pow(q, -1, M)) % M`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `M`, and the input constraints remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - We need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(m\) pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing these values into `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), which is correctly calculated as `cn2`.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values is derived from the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the increase in their friendship value over the excursions.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single excursion is \(\frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Over \(k\) excursions, the expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Additionally, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a pair of friends is chosen is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for the remaining \(k-1\) excursions.
   - Therefore, the additional expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1)\).

5. **Combining the Expected Values:**
   - The total expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}} + k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot m \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The program correctly calculates this as:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]

6. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both \(p\) and \(q\) by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

7. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program correctly computes the modular inverse of \(q\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then multiplies \(p\) by the modular inverse of \(q\) and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, calculates the expected value accurately, and ensures the final result is in the required format.
