### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of input for `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for all pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of possible pairs of children `cn2` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` of the expected value fraction.
   - The formula for `p` is \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - The formula for `q` is \( 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \).

5. **Simplification**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

6. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as \( (p \cdot \text{mod\_inv}(q)) \mod M \).

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair can be derived from the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the increase in their friendship value.
- The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} \) accounts for the initial friendship values and the probability of choosing each pair.
- The term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) accounts for the increase in friendship values over subsequent excursions.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value based on the given problem description.
- The use of modular arithmetic and the modular inverse is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring the result is within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and adheres to the problem's requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
