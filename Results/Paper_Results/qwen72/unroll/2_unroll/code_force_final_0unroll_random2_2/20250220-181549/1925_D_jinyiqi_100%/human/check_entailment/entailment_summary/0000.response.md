Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and ensures that the inputs are within the specified constraints.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, and sums up the initial friendship values `f_i`.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is correct.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot C(n, 2) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot C(n, 2)^2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. The term `2 * k * C(n, 2) * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values, and the term `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values over subsequent excursions.

4. **GCD and Modular Inverse**:
   - The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` to simplify the fraction.
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`, where `M = 10^9 + 7`.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `m = 0` (no friends) correctly, as the expected value is 0.
   - It also handles the case where `m = 1` (one pair of friends) correctly, as the friendship value increases linearly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
