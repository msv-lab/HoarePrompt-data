Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, then reads `m` lines of input for `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It calculates `p` and `q` based on these inputs, simplifies the fraction `p/q` using the greatest common divisor, and prints the result of `(p * pow(q, -1, M)) % M`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `M`, and the input constraints remain unchanged.**
