Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers. It calculates a series of modified sums based on these inputs and prints the maximum of these sums. The variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are not modified after the function processes each test case. **
