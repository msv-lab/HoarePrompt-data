### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `cases` for further processing.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the required values and lists.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case one by one.
   - It first converts the arrays `a` and `b` to sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to remove duplicates and facilitate set operations.
   - It then creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` containing only the elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` are correctly created, and the sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are correctly filtered to include only elements less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` is the set of elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The set operations are correctly performed, and the resulting sets are as described.

4. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` (i.e., `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all integers from 1 to `k`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it means it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array to cover all integers from 1 to `k`, so the function appends 'YES' to the results.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The conditions and set operations used are appropriate and cover all necessary cases. The logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether the required elements can be chosen.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are stored in the `results` list.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The state of `results` is correctly described, and the program prints the results as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. The conditions and set operations used are appropriate and cover all necessary cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Final: **True**
