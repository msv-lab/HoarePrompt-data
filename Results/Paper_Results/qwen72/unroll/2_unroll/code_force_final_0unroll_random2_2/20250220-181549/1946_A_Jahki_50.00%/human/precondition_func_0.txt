The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by the input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
