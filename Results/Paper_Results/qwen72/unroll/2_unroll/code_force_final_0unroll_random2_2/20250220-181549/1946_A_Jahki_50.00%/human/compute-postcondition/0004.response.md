Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `num` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `num2` and a space-separated list of integers `case`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` derived from `case` and prints this number. The function does not return any values but modifies and prints the result for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input variables `num`, `num2`, `case`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` are updated for each test case, but their final values depend on the last test case processed. The variable `num` remains unchanged. **
