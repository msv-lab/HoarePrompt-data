Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not generate the correct output for the given problem. The function `func_1` constructs a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

For example, in the case of `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program generates the string `abab`. However, this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`). Specifically, the subsequences `ac`, `ca`, `cc`, and `bc` are missing.

A correct solution would need to generate a string that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. One possible approach is to concatenate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets, or to use a more optimized method to ensure the smallest possible length of the string `s` that contains all required subsequences.
