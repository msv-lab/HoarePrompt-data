Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the input array `l` contains duplicate elements. According to the problem description, the elements of the progressive square should be unique, but the program does not check for this condition. If the input array contains duplicates, the program will still return "yes" even though it is impossible to form a progressive square with unique elements from the array.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 6 4 8

Output:
yes

Expected Output:
no
```

In this case, the input array contains the number `6` twice, which means it is impossible to form a progressive square with unique elements. However, the program incorrectly returns "yes".
