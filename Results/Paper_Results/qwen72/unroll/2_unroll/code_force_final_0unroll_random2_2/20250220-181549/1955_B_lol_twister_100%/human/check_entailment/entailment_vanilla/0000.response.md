Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list of integers `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This is correct because it follows the rules of the progressive square construction.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`. It then compares the two sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns "yes"; otherwise, it returns "no". This is correct because the elements of the progressive square should match the elements in the input list `l` when sorted.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the correct way to output the results.

However, there is a minor issue with the output format. The problem statement specifies that the output should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program returns "yes" or "no". This could be a problem if the judge is case-sensitive.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the program should return "YES" or "NO" instead of "yes" or "no". Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

With this correction, the program should be considered correct. 

Correctness: **True** (after the correction)
