### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - You want to maximize your points by playing a card that matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene will play optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours. This means she will play a card that matches a card on the table if it benefits her, and if it doesn't, she will play a card that doesn't match to prevent you from scoring.

3. **Counting Strategy:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to count the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand.
   - If you have a card with a number x, and you have another card with the same number x, you can score a point by playing the second card when the first card is already on the table.
   - The number of points you can score is the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards n and the list of integers a on your cards.
   - It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of times each integer appears in your hand.
   - It then iterates through the list a, incrementing the count for each integer.
   - Finally, it calculates the maximum number of points you can score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each integer x in the count array. This is because for each integer x, if you have more than one card with x, you can score `x - 1` points (one point for each pair).

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The count array `cnt` is correctly initialized and updated to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - The calculation of `ans` using `max(0, x - 1)` is correct, as it counts the number of pairs of cards you have.
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of points you can score.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs of cards you have.
   - The program correctly sums the points you can score based on these pairs.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and reads input in the correct format.
   - The strategy of counting pairs and summing `max(0, x - 1)` is logically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally.

Final: **True**
