The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. Each integer in `a` ranges from 1 to `n` and appears at most twice. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
