Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Counting Cards**: For each test case, it initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand. This is necessary to determine how many pairs of cards you have.

3. **Calculating Points**: The program then iterates through the `cnt` list and adds `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer for each card type `x`. This is correct because:
   - If you have 0 or 1 card of a particular type, you cannot score any points from that type.
   - If you have 2 cards of a particular type, you can score 1 point (since the second card will match the first one on the table).

4. **Optimal Play**: The program assumes that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. By counting the pairs in your hand, the program ensures that you are playing optimally to maximize your score, which is the best you can do given Nene's optimal play.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum number of points you can score for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem's requirements, and the program should produce the correct results for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
