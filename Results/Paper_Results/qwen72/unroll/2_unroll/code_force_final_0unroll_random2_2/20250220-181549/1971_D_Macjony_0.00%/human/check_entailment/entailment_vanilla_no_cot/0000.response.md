Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of cuts needed. The program increments the `count` variable every time it encounters a transition between characters (from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'), but it does not account for the fact that once a '1' appears before a '0', the string can be sorted by cutting it into two pieces: one before the first '1' and one after the last '0'. 

Here is a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. Count the number of '1's that appear before the first '0' in the string.
2. Count the number of '0's that appear after the last '1' in the string.
3. The minimum number of pieces needed is the sum of these counts plus one (for the piece that contains the transition from '0' to '1').

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Find the first '0' and the last '1'
        first_zero = s.find('0')
        last_one = s.rfind('1')
        
        # If there are no '0's or no '1's, the string is already sorted
        if first_zero == -1 or last_one == -1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of '1's before the first '0'
        ones_before_zero = s[:first_zero].count('1')
        
        # Count the number of '0's after the last '1'
        zeros_after_one = s[last_one+1:].count('0')
        
        # The minimum number of pieces needed
        count = ones_before_zero + zeros_after_one + 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.
