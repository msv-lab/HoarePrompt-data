You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `count` after each iteration, which represents the number of alternating character sequences in the binary string `s` minus one if a '01' pattern is found. The variable `s` will be updated to the input string provided during each iteration, and `t` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous pieces to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - It iterates through the string with a while loop, checking if the current character is different from the next character.
   - If the characters are different, it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `count` is initialized to 1, which is correct because at least one piece is needed.
   - **Transition Handling:**
     - The program correctly identifies transitions between different characters.
     - It increments `count` for each transition, which is necessary to ensure that each piece is contiguous.
   - **Special Case for '0' to '1' Transition:**
     - The program sets `flag` to `True` when it encounters a '0' to '1' transition and skips the next character.
     - This is to avoid counting the same transition twice.
   - **Final Adjustment:**
     - If `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This is because the last '0' to '1' transition is counted as an extra piece, which is not needed since the pieces can be rearranged.
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the final `count` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Character Strings:**
     - If the string is a single character, the program correctly outputs 1.
   - **Sorted Strings:**
     - If the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's), the program correctly outputs 1.
   - **Strings with No Transitions:**
     - If the string has no transitions (e.g., all '0's or all '1's), the program correctly outputs 1.
   - **Strings with Multiple Transitions:**
     - The program correctly handles strings with multiple transitions, ensuring that the minimum number of pieces is calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases. It accurately calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Correctness:
**True**
