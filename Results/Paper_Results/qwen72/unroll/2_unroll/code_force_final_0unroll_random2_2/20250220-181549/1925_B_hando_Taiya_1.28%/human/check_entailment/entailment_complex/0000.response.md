### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems such that their sum is `x` and there are `n` sub-problems.
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that is less than or equal to `n` or `x // n`.
   - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` and `x // i` are divisors of `x`.
   - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `n` is equal to `x`, the program correctly finds the GCD, which is `x` itself.
   - For the case where `n` is greater than `x`, the program correctly finds the GCD, which is `1` (since the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty `1`).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by checking the divisors of `x` and ensuring that the number of sub-problems `n` is satisfied. The conditions and edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
