The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5. `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `count` remains unchanged.
