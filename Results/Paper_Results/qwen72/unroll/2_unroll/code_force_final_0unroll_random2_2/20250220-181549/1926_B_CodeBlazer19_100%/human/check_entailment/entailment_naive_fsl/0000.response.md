Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly identify the shape in certain cases. For example, consider a grid where the shape is a triangle but does not have any row with exactly one '1'. The program will incorrectly identify it as a square.

Example Input:
```
1
4
0000
0110
0110
1111
```

Expected Output:
```
TRIANGLE
```

Actual Output:
```
SQUARE
```

In this case, the program fails to recognize the triangle because it does not have a row with exactly one '1'. Instead, it incorrectly identifies the shape as a square.
