The function reads a series of grids from user input, where each grid is a list of strings representing a grid of size n x n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) with characters '0' or '1'. For each grid, it prints 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. If no row contains a '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. The function does not modify the input grids.
