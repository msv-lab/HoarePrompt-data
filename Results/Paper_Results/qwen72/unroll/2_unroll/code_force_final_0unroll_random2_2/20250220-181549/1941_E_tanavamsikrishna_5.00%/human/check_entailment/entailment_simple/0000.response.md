### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads `n` rows of the river grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to compute the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and prints the minimum total cost.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the cost of building a bridge on a single row.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1, which is correct because these elements represent the cost of installing supports in the first `d-1` columns.
   - For the remaining elements, it updates each element to the minimum of the previous `d` elements (including the first `d-1` elements and the updated elements) plus the original value of that element plus 1. This is also correct because it ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for a single test case and processes it.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - It prints the minimum total cost from the `total_costs` list.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the edge cases where `k = 1` or `k = n`.
   - The program ensures that the first and last columns of each row have a depth of 0, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program correctly handles the maximum distance `d` between supports.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm used in `func_1` ensures that the cost of building a bridge is minimized by considering the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements.
   - The algorithm used in `func_2` correctly computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
