### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid, ensuring that supports are installed in the first and last columns and that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Initial Increment:**
     - The function increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1. This is correct because supports must be installed in these cells, and the cost of installing a support is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - **Dynamic Programming:**
     - For the remaining cells, the function updates the cost of each cell to the minimum of the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) plus the current cell's depth plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the minimum cost to build the bridge on that row. This is correct because the last element will have the minimum cost accumulated from the first to the last column, considering the constraints.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads the input for each test case, including the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
     - It reads the grid and processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - **Total Cost Calculation:**
     - The function calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
     - It then finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Output:**
     - The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case, which is the correct output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `d` is 1, meaning supports must be installed in every cell.
   - The function also handles the edge case where `d` is large enough to cover the entire row, meaning supports can be installed only at the river banks.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of columns.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is `O(t * n * m)`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of rows, and `m` is the number of columns.
   - This is efficient given the constraints.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
    - The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
    - Each subsequent element is updated to the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus the original value plus 1.
    - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which is the correct minimum cost for building the bridge on that row.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
    - The input is read and processed correctly.
    - The costs for each row are calculated using `func_1`.
    - The total costs for building `k` consecutive bridges are calculated and stored in `total_costs`.
    - The minimum total cost is printed for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges, considering the constraints and edge cases. The time complexity is efficient given the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
