Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers provided by the input, and `rows` is now a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers as provided by the input, where `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` and `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m`.** 

The code snippet updates the `rows` variable to a new list of lists based on the input. Each inner list contains `m` integers, and the entire `rows` list contains `n` such inner lists. The constraints on the values of the elements in `rows` remain the same as in the initial state.
