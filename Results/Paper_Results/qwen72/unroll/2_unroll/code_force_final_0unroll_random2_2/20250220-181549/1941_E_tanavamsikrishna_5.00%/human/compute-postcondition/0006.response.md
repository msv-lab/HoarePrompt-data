Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs` remain unchanged.
- `total_costs` is a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
- The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Explanation:
1. **`costs` List**: This is a list of integers.
2. **`total_costs` List**: This list is constructed by summing up `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. For example, if `costs` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k` is `3`, then `total_costs` would be `[6, 9]` because:
   - The first sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
   - The second sum is `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
   - The third sum is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`, but this is not included because it would exceed the length of `costs` by `k-1`.

3. **Length of `total_costs`**: The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This is because each sum of `k` consecutive elements can only be calculated up to the point where there are still `k` elements left in the `costs` list.

4. **`min(total_costs)`**: The `min` function will return the smallest integer in the `total_costs` list.

### Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list, which is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of integers, each being the sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
