Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). This is a critical part of the problem, and the current implementation fails to ensure this constraint.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Distance Constraint Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` updates each cell in the row by adding 1 to its depth and then adding the minimum of the previous \(d+1\) cells (including the current cell) to it. This approach does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports.
   - Specifically, the line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` is problematic. It calculates the minimum of the previous \(d+1\) cells, which can include cells that are more than \(d\) positions away from the current cell. This violates the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\).

2. **Example Input**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     3 5 1 2
     0 1 0 1 0
     0 2 2 2 0
     0 3 3 3 0
     ```
   - The correct output should be 4, as the minimum cost of building a bridge in the first row is 4 (installing supports at columns 1, 3, and 5).
   - However, the program will output 6 because it incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the middle cells without considering the correct distance constraint.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach is needed. We need to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell while ensuring that the distance constraint is met.
   - For each cell, we should consider the minimum cost from the previous cells that are within the distance \(d\).

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect due to the flawed handling of the distance constraint.

Final: **False**
