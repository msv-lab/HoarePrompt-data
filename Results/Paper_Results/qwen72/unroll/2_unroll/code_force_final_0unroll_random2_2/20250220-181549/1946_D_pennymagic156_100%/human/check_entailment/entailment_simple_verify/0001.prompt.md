You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle input. However, these functions are not used consistently. For example, `func_2` and `func_4` are defined but not used in the main logic.
   - The main function `func_5` is responsible for processing each test case.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1.
   - The loop iterates over the bits of the numbers from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - For each bit position `i`, it extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the array `a`.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is also 0, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is not 0, it checks if the sum is odd. If it is, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the condition. If the sum is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It then appends the XOR of these segments to `t` and resets `a` to `t`.

4. **Handling Non-Zero Bits**:
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even and non-zero, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the count of such segments.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is 0, it breaks the loop.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for splitting the array into segments based on the `i`-th bit and checking the conditions is sound.
- The program correctly updates `ans` and returns the maximum number of segments or -1 if no valid segments can be found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
