Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^30, and `a` is now updated to the list returned by `func_1()`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `x` are still updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The variable `a` is now assigned the list returned by `func_1()`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^30.
