The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `start`, `end`, and the current directory containing subfolders with names that can be converted to integers within the range [start, end] does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. The `results` list being empty also does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be converted to integers within the range [start, end], each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
