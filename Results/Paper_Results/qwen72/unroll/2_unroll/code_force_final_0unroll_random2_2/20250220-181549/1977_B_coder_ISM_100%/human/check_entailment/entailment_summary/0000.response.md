### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function constructs a binary representation of `x` by checking each bit from 0 to 29 (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - If a bit is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Modification of Binary Representation**:
   - The function then iterates through the binary representation to modify it according to the given rules:
     - If `flag` is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the bit to '1' and resets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is not set and two consecutive bits are '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is set and the current bit is not '0', it changes the bit to '0'.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If `flag` is set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by one.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist. If a '-1' is followed by a '1', it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified binary representation and the modified binary digits.

### Analysis of the Rules:
- The function correctly ensures that the sum of the modified binary representation equals the original `x`.
- The function also ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, which is a key requirement of the problem.

### Potential Issues:
- The function initializes the length to 30, which is the maximum possible length of the binary representation of `x` (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)). However, the actual length of the modified binary representation might be less than 30, and the function should print the correct length.
- The function appends an additional '1' to the list if necessary, which is a valid approach to ensure the sum equals `x` and no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and produce valid output for the given test cases. The logic for modifying the binary representation and ensuring the constraints are met is sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
