Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the constraint that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

For example, consider the input \(x = 13\). The binary representation of 13 is `1101`. The program will initially set the array `s` to `['1', '1', '0', '1']`. However, this array violates the constraint because both \(a_0\) and \(a_1\) are non-zero. The program does not correctly adjust the array to meet this constraint. 

A correct output for \(x = 13\) should be something like:
```
5
0 -1 0 1 1
```
But the program will output:
```
4
1 1 0 1
```
which is incorrect.
