Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by converting the integer `x` into a binary representation and then manipulating the bits to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Binary Conversion and Bit Manipulation:**
   - The program converts `x` to a binary representation and stores it in the list `s` as a string of '0's and '1's.
   - The program then tries to manipulate the list to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. However, the logic for this manipulation is flawed.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The program uses a flag to indicate when a '1' needs to be adjusted. However, the way it handles the flag and the adjustments is not correct.
   - For example, when it encounters two consecutive '1's, it sets the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag. This can lead to incorrect results if the next bit is also a '1' or if the flag is not properly reset.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The program makes a final adjustment to the last element if the flag is set, but this adjustment is not always correct and can lead to invalid results.
   - The program also tries to adjust the list again after the final element, which is unnecessary and can cause further issues.

4. **Output Length:**
   - The program always outputs a length of 30, which is not necessarily the correct length for the array. The length should be the smallest possible value that satisfies the conditions.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve converting the integer `x` to its binary representation and then ensuring that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting the bits accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        carry = 0
        while x > 0:
            bit = x & 1
            if bit == 1 and carry == 1:
                s.append('-1')
                carry = 1
            elif bit == 1:
                s.append('1')
                carry = 0
            elif bit == 0 and carry == 1:
                s.append('1')
                carry = 1
            else:
                s.append('0')
                carry = 0
            x >>= 1
            length += 1
        if carry == 1:
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        s.reverse()
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Binary Conversion:**
  - The program converts `x` to its binary representation by repeatedly taking the least significant bit and shifting `x` to the right.
- **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
  - The program uses a `carry` variable to handle the case where two consecutive non-zero elements would otherwise occur.
  - If the current bit is `1` and there is a carry, it sets the current bit to `-1` and keeps the carry.
  - If the current bit is `1` and there is no carry, it sets the current bit to `1` and resets the carry.
  - If the current bit is `0` and there is a carry, it sets the current bit to `1` and keeps the carry.
  - If the current bit is `0` and there is no carry, it sets the current bit to `0` and resets the carry.
- **Final Adjustment:**
  - If there is a carry left after processing all bits, it appends an additional `1` to the list.
- **Output:**
  - The program prints the length of the list and the list itself.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
