Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` remains unchanged.
3. `costs` remains unchanged.
4. `h` is calculated as `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.
5. `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`**: `n` is explicitly given as 0.
2. **Value of `k`**: `k` is not explicitly given, but it remains unchanged. This means `k` is some integer value that is not modified.
3. **Value of `costs`**: `costs` is not explicitly given, but it remains unchanged. This means `costs` is some list of integers that is not modified.
4. **Calculation of `h`**:
   - `h` is calculated as `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.
   - Substituting `n = 0` into the formula, we get `h = k + (0 - k + 1) // (0 - k + 1)`.
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses: `0 - k + 1` is `1 - k`.
   - The expression becomes `h = k + (1 - k) // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `1 - k` is the same in both the numerator and the denominator, `(1 - k) // (1 - k)` simplifies to 1 (assuming `k` is not 1, otherwise it would be 0).
   - Therefore, `h = k + 1`.

5. **Condition `h >= k`**:
   - Given that `h = k + 1`, it is always true that `h >= k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*costs)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the list `costs` separated by spaces.
- Since `costs` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it as a list of integers that remains unchanged.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces] (where `costs` is a list of integers that remains unchanged)**
