Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1. This is because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is a valid solution.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall is set to a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy at most `k - 1` jewels from this stall because:
     - If Alice buys `k` jewels, she would spend `(n - k + 1) * k` coins, which is more than `n` coins.
     - If Alice buys `k - 1` jewels, she would spend `(n - k + 1) * (k - 1)` coins, which is less than or equal to `n` coins.
   - The second stall is set to a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy the remaining 1 jewel from this stall.
   - The program then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) by iterating over the `costs` list and updating `n` accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices of the two stalls. This is because the setup ensures Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n == k` correctly.
   - The program handles the case where `n < k` correctly.
   - For the general case, the program ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls with appropriate prices.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.
   - The prices of the stalls are within the allowed range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
