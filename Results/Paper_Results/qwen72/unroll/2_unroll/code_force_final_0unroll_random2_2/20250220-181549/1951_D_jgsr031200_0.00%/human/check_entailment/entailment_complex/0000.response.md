Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function first checks if `n` equals `k`. If so, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels, setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel will ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` list and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall (`curr = n // i`), updates `h` (the total number of jewels bought), and reduces `n` by the total cost of the jewels bought from the current stall (`n -= i * curr`).

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if `h` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because the logic in the loop does not guarantee that `h` will always be at least `k` after the loop.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of the `costs` list.

4. **Issues**:
   - The logic in the loop is flawed. The function assumes that by setting the first stall price to `n - k + 1` and the second stall price to `1`, Alice will always buy exactly `k` jewels. However, this is not always true.
   - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the function sets `costs` to `[5, 1]`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since `7 // 5 = 1`) and 2 jewels from the second stall (since `2 // 1 = 2`), totaling 3 jewels. This is correct.
   - However, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the function sets `costs` to `[248, 1]`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since `255 // 248 = 1`) and 7 jewels from the second stall (since `7 // 1 = 7`), totaling 8 jewels. This is correct.
   - The issue arises when `n` and `k` are such that the first stall price `n - k + 1` is too high, and Alice cannot buy any jewels from it. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the function sets `costs` to `[3, 1]`. Alice will buy 0 jewels from the first stall (since `6 // 3 = 2` but `2 < 3`) and 6 jewels from the second stall (since `6 // 1 = 6`), totaling 6 jewels, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would be to set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each of the first `k` stalls.
   - If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible to set up the required number of stalls, and the function should print "NO".

Given the issues in the main logic, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
