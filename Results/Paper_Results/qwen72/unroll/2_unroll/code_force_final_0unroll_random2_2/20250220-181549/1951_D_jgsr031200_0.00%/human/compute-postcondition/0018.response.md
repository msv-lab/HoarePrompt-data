Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (let's assume `k` has some value, but it is not specified).
   - `costs` remains unchanged (this variable is not used in the given code snippet).
   - `h` is calculated as `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is calculated as `k + (0 - k + 1) // (0 - k + 1)`.
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
     - `(0 - k + 1)` is `1 - k`.
   - The division `(1 - k) // (1 - k)` is 1 (since any non-zero number divided by itself is 1).
   - Therefore, `h` is `k + 1`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `h >= k` is always true because `h` is `k + 1`, which is always greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the `print` statement will always execute and print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
