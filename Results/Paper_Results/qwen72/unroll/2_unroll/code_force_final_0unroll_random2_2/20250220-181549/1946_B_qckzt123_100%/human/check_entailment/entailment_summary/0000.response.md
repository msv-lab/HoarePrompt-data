### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the list `a` using the `sum` function. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum subarray sum `t` that is non-negative. This is done by iterating through the list `a` and maintaining a running sum `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. This ensures that only non-negative subarray sums are considered.
   - The variable `t` is updated to the maximum value of `tmp` during the iteration. This is a correct approach to find the maximum subarray sum.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The initial result `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This ensures that the sum of the original array and the maximum subarray sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` and is non-negative.
   - For each of the remaining `k - 1` operations, the program doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, applying the modulo operation at each step. This is based on the observation that the maximum subarray sum can be added repeatedly to maximize the final sum.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the algorithm for finding the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is logically sound. The use of modulo operations ensures that the results are within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
