Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is an integer read from the standard input and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
