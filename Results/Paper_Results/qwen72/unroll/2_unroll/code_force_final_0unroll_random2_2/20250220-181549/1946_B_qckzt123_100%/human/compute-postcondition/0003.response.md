Output State: **The variable `T` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been completed. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each iteration based on the input. The variable `s` is the sum of the list `a` for the current iteration. The variable `t` is the maximum subarray sum ending at any index in the list `a` for the current iteration, but reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `tmp` is the running sum used to calculate `t` and is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `ans` is the final computed value for the current iteration, which is printed. The variable `MOD` remains unchanged.**
