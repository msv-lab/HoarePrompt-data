Output State: **`b` is a list of n integers where the integers from `a` have been appended to `b` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the integer from the left side of `a` (starting from index 0) is appended to `b`. If `s[i]` is 'R', the integer from the right side of `a` (starting from index n-1) is appended to `b`. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `l` is n and `r` is -1. `ans` is an empty list. `p` is 1.**
