Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers from `a` have been appended to `b` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the integer from the left side of `a` (starting from index 0) is appended to `b`. If `s[i]` is 'R', the integer from the right side of `a` (starting from index n-1) is appended to `b`. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `l` is n and `r` is -1. `ans` is an empty list. `p` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v
    ans.append(p)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
