Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the beginning of each command execution. Instead, it appends the elements to a list `b` based on the commands and then computes the product in reverse order. This approach does not match the problem description, which requires the product to be computed and the remainder to be taken at each step before removing an element.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2 8 32 64
```

The program fails because it does not correctly compute the product and remainder at each step. It should output the remainder of the product of the current array before removing an element, but it instead outputs the product of elements in a different order.
