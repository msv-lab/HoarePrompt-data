You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    r = n - 1

        if s[i] == 'L':

            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])

    #State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers from `a` have been appended to `b` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the integer from the left side of `a` (starting from index 0) is appended to `b`. If `s[i]` is 'R', the integer from the right side of `a` (starting from index n-1) is appended to `b`. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `l` is n and `r` is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` remains the same list of n integers, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions provided by the string `s` to create a new list `b`. Each character in `s` ('L' or 'R') determines whether to take the next element from the start or the end of `a` and append it to `b`. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list in its original order. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

4. **Product Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying each element to `p` and taking the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - The result is appended to the list `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the elements at the beginning of each command execution.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The program does not correctly calculate the product of the elements in the array `a` at each step before removing an element. Instead, it calculates the product of the elements that have been removed, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The product of the elements in the array `a` should be calculated before each command is executed, and the remainder should be taken at that point.
- After each command, the corresponding element should be removed from the array `a`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[i]) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[i], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            a.pop()
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product of all elements in `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
  - For each command, the current product is appended to the list `b`.
  - To remove an element, the product is divided by that element using modular inverse (since we are working with modulo `m`).

- **Modular Inverse:**
  - The modular inverse of an element `x` modulo `m` is calculated using `pow(x, m-2, m)`, which works because `m` is a positive integer and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the product of the elements in the array `a` before each command is executed.

Correctness: **False**
