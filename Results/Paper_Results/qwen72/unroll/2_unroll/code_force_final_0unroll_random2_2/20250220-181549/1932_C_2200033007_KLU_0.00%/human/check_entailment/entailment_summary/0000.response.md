Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not calculate the remainder of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element. Instead, it constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`, and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not match the problem requirements, which state that the product of the current state of the array `a` should be taken modulo `m` before each command is executed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m` at the beginning of each command.
2. Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for x in a:
        product = (product * x) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[i], -1, m)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[n - 1 - i], -1, m)) % m
    return b
```

In this corrected version:
- `product` is initialized to the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- For each command, the current product is appended to `b`.
- The appropriate element is then removed from the product by multiplying it by the modular inverse of the element to be removed, and taking the result modulo `m`.

The original program does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
