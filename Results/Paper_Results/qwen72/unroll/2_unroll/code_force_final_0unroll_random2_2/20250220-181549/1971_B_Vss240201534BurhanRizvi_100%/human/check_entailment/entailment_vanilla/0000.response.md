### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the string `s`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Single Character String:**
     - If the string `s` has only one character, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.
   - **All Characters the Same:**
     - If the string `s` has more than one character but all characters are the same, it is also impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly prints "No" in this case by checking if the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - For strings that can be rearranged, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`.
   - If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as `s`, the program falls back to a simple rearrangement by moving the first character to the end of the string (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` for valid cases.
   - It prints "No" for invalid cases.

### Analysis:
- **Random Shuffling:**
  - The use of `random.sample` to shuffle the string is a valid approach, but it is not guaranteed to produce a different string every time. However, the fallback logic ensures that if the shuffled string is the same as the original, a different string is generated.
- **Fallback Logic:**
  - The fallback logic `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` is correct because it guarantees that the new string `s2` will be different from `s` as long as `s` has more than one unique character.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string has only one character or all characters are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and handles all edge cases and valid inputs appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
