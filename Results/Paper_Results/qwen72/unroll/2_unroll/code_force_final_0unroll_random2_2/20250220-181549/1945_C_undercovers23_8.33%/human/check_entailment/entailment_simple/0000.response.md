### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - This is correctly handled and matches the problem description.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function calculates `pk` as `n // 2` to find the middle position of the village.
   - It converts the string `s` to a list `sl` and counts the number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the list.
   - This setup is correct and necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Iterating Through Possible Positions**:
   - The function iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each position `i`, it updates the count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side.
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, it adds the position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (the middle of the village).
   - If multiple positions are equally close, it sorts the list and selects the smallest one.
   - This is correct and matches the problem requirement to minimize `|n/2 - i|` and output the smaller one if there are multiple.

5. **Handling No Valid Positions**:
   - If no valid positions are found in `lst`, the function checks the overall majority of '0's and '1's.
   - If the majority of residents want to live on the right side, it outputs `n` (road after the last house).
   - Otherwise, it outputs `0` (road before the first house).
   - This is also correct and ensures that the function always outputs a valid answer.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position for each test case.
   - This matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the preferences, and outputs the optimal position for each test case as described in the problem. The logic for determining the valid positions and selecting the closest one to the middle is sound and follows the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
