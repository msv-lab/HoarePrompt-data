Output State: **The function prints the optimal index for each test case where the percentage of residents on the left side who want to live on the left side and the percentage of residents on the right side who want to live on the right side are both at least 50%. If no such index exists, it prints either 0 or n, depending on which side has a majority of residents who want to live there. The loop iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each one.**
