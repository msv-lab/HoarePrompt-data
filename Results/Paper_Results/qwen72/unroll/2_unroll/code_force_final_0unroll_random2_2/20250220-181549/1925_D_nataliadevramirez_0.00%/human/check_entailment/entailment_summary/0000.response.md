### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time they are chosen for an excursion.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - We need to return \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` multiplied by \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) modulo `MOD`.
     - The formula \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) is the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which represents the total increase in friendship value if a pair is chosen \(k\) times.
     - However, this function does not account for the probability of choosing each pair, which is crucial for calculating the expected value.
     - The expected value for each friendship pair should be the product of the friendship value `f` and the probability of choosing that pair, multiplied by the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \(n\).
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each pair over \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the expected value for a single friendship pair \((a, b, f)\) is \(f \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
   - Summing this over all \(m\) pairs gives the total expected value.

4. **Modular Inverse**:
   - To compute the expected value modulo \(10^9 + 7\), we need to use the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse of a number \(a\) modulo \(m\) is a number \(b\) such that \(a \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod m\).

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not consider the probability of choosing each pair.
   - It simply multiplies the friendship value by the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which is incorrect.

6. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It lacks the necessary probability calculation and modular inverse for the correct expected value.

Correctness: **False**
