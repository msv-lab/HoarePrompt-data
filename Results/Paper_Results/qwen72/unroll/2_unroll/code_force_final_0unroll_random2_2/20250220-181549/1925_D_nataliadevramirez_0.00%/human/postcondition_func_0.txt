The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of children), `m` (the number of friendship pairs), `k` (the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples representing the friendship pairs and their initial values). It calculates the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` in `friendships` multiplied by the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged after the function call.
