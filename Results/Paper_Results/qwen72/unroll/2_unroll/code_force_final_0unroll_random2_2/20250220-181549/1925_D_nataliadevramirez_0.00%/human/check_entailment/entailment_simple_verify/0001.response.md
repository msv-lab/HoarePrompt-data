### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The teacher selects pairs of children for `k` excursions, and if a pair of friends is selected, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair of friends is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends over `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The initial friendship value of a pair is `f_i`.
   - The expected total friendship value for a specific pair after `k` excursions is \( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - Summing this over all `m` pairs of friends gives the total expected value:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
     \]

3. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The final result needs to be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) to handle the division in the expected value calculation.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function calculates the total expected value by summing \( f_i \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for each pair of friends.
     - This is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selection and the correct expected value formula.
     - The correct formula should be:
       \[
       \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
       \]
     - The current implementation in `func_1` is:
       \[
       \text{Result} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This formula is incorrect because it multiplies each friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is not the expected value calculation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input reading and calling of `func_1` are correct, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair and summing these values, taking into account the modular inverse for the division.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
