No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5). The next m lines each contain three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.
