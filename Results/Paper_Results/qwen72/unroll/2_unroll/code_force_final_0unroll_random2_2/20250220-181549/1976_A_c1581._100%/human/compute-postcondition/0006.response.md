The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `digits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `digits`. If `digits` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password`, and `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least one element, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`**
