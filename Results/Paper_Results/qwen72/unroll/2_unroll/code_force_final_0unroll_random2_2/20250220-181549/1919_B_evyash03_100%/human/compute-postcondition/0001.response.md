The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution. For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a string of length `length` with at least one character, and `char` should be the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `char` is the first character of `expression`, `count` is 0**
