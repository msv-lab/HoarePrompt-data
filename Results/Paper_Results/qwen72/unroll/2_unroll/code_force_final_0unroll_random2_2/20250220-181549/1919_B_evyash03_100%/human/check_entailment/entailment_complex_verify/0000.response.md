### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program provided does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not consider the process of splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

#### Key Points from the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` does not split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty for each subarray. It only calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
2. **Counterexample**: The provided counterexample clearly demonstrates that the program's output is incorrect. For the input `6` and `+-+---`, the program outputs `3`, while the correct minimum penalty is `4`.

#### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call**: The `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of '+' and '-', and `length` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{length} \leq 5000\).
- **Function Logic**:
  - `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
  - `sub` is the number of '-' characters in `expression` (calculated as `length - count`).
  - The function returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

This logic does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray, which is not done in the provided program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
