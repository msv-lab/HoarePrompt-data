Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. The issue lies in how the program calculates and uses the `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values. Specifically, the program only checks if the current number can form a beautiful pair with numbers that have already been processed, but it does not correctly account for the pairs where the current number is the second element of the pair.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider both conditions for a beautiful pair:
1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

For each number \( a_i \), you need to find another number \( a_j \) such that:
- \( (a_i + a_j) \% x = 0 \)
- \( (a_i - a_j) \% y = 0 \)

The program should keep track of the frequency of pairs that satisfy these conditions and then count the valid pairs accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This version of the program iterates through all possible pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and checks if they satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair. It then counts the number of such pairs and appends the result to the `results` list.

However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which is not efficient for large values of \(n\) (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)). A more efficient approach would be to use a frequency dictionary to count the pairs in \(O(n)\) time. Here is a more efficient version:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for i in range(n):
            num = a[i]
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

In this version, the program correctly calculates the required modulo values and uses the frequency dictionary to count the number of valid pairs efficiently. This should work correctly for the given problem constraints.
