### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the test case parameters and arrays).
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `params` key and the array `a` from the `array` key.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each number in the array `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

3. **Required Modulo Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array, the required modulo values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated.
   - `required_mod_x` is the value that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a number divisible by `x`. This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y` because the difference `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The function checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`.
   - If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count` because it means there are already numbers in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current number.
   - The frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is then updated in the dictionary.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, the function appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that the pairs are counted efficiently without needing to compare each pair of indices directly, which would be \(O(n^2)\) and inefficient for large \(n\).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where \(x\) and \(y\) are different values.
  - It also handles the case where the array `a` contains duplicate values, which can form multiple beautiful pairs.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly solves the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
