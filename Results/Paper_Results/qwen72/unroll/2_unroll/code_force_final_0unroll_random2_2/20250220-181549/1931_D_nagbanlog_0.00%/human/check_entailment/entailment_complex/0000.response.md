Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to count the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for each test case. A beautiful pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is defined by two conditions:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's break down the function and analyze its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It iterates over each test case in `test_cases`, extracting `n`, `x`, and `y` from the 'params' key and the array `a` from the 'array' key.

2. **Frequency Dictionary:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) where \(\text{mod}_x = \text{num} \% x\) and \(\text{mod}_y = \text{num} \% y\).
   - This dictionary helps in efficiently counting the pairs that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the function calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates `required_mod_x` as \((x - \text{mod}_x) \% x\). This is the value that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a number divisible by \(x\).
   - The `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y` because for \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), the modulo of both numbers should be the same.

4. **Updating Count:**
   - The function checks if the pair \((\text{required_mod_x}, \text{required_mod_y})\) is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It then updates the frequency of the current pair \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) in the `freq` dictionary.

5. **Output and Reset:**
   - After processing all numbers in the array `a`, the function appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - The `freq` dictionary and `beautiful_count` are reset for the next test case.

6. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic of the function:
- The function calculates `required_mod_x` as \((x - \text{mod}_x) \% x\), which is correct for finding the complement that makes the sum divisible by \(x\).
- But it assumes that `required_mod_y` should be the same as `mod_y`, which is incorrect. For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), the modulo of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) should be the same, but the function does not correctly handle this.

To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the function should:
- For each number `num`, find all previous numbers `prev_num` in the array and check if \((\text{num} + \text{prev_num}) \% x == 0\) and \((\text{num} - \text{prev_num}) \% y == 0\).

Given this, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the second condition for beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **False**
