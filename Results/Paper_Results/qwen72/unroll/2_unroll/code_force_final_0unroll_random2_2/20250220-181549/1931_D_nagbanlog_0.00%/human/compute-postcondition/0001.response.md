The only objects in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one test case, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple, and `case` will be the first tuple in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in the list, `results` is an empty list**
