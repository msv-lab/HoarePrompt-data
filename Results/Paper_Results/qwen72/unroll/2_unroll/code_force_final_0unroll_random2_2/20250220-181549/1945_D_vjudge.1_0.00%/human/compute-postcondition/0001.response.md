The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is greater than 0. Since `numero_testes` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, it is guaranteed that `numero_testes` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`numero_testes` is an input integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
