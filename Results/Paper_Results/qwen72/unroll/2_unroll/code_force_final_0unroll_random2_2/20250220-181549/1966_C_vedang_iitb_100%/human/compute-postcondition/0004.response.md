Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the following rules: If the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list of pile sizes (MEX) is greater than the maximum pile size, the winner is 'Alice' if MEX is even, and 'Bob' if MEX is odd. If MEX is not greater than the maximum pile size, the winner is 'Alice' if MEX is odd, and 'Bob' if MEX is even. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer in their initial states. **
