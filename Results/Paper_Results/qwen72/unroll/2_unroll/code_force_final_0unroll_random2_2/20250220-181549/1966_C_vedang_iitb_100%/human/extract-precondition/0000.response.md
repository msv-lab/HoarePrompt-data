Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through a standard input mechanism (like reading from stdin) and not through function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) represents the number of piles, and the next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
