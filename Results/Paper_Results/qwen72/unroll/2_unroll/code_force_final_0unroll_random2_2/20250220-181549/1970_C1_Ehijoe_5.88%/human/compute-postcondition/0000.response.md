Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and t (t=1), the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes u and v in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The next line contains t integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n) corresponding to the node where the stone is initially placed for the round. `n` and `t` are now assigned the values provided by the first line of input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, and `t` is 1.**
