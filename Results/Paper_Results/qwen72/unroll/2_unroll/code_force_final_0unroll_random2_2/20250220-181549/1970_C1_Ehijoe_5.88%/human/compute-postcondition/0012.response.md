Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the second element is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then the program follows the if part. Otherwise, both elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.***
