The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. If `n - 1` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `n - 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute. However, the initial state of `i` is not specified, and for the loop to start, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
