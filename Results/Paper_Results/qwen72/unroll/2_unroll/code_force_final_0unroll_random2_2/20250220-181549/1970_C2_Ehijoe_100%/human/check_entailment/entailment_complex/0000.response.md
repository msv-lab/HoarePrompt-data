### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played optimally by both players.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round given the starting node.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function checks if the player starting from node `start` can force a win.
     - It returns `False` if the starting node `start` has only one adjacent node, and that adjacent node is the parent node. This means the starting node is a leaf, and the player who starts from a leaf node loses because they cannot make a move.
     - Otherwise, it recursively checks the subtrees rooted at each neighbor of `start` (excluding the parent node) to see if any of these subtrees can force a win. If any neighbor can force a win, the function returns `True`.
     - The function uses the `any` function to determine if any of the recursive calls return `True`. This is correct because if any neighbor can force a win, the player starting from `start` can also force a win by moving to that neighbor.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
     - It reads `n` and `t` from the input. Since `t` is always 1, this is consistent with the problem description.
     - It constructs the adjacency list `nodes` from the input edges.
     - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`. This is not necessary for the correctness of the solution but does not affect the outcome.
     - It reads the starting node `start` from the input.
     - It calls `func_1` with the constructed tree and the starting node.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione". This is correct because if `func_1` returns `True`, it means the starting player (Ron) can force a win, and if it returns `False`, the starting player cannot force a win, so Hermione wins.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly constructs the tree from the input.
   - The `func_1` function correctly determines if the starting player can force a win based on the tree structure.
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the starting node and prints the winner based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and should correctly determine the winner for each round.

### Correctness:
**True**
