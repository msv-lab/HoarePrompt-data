Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values from `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The initial state variables `n` and `t` are updated with the values provided by the user input. The dictionary `nodes` and the integer `start` remain unchanged, and the list `edges` is still empty. The variable `empty` is now set to `True`.
