Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` remains a defaultdict(list) with the same keys and values as in the initial state, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one neighbor, `start` is now an integer provided by the user, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` assigns the result of the function `func_1` with arguments `nodes` and `start` to the variable `moves`. The initial state variables `n`, `t`, `nodes`, `edges`, `empty`, and `leaves` remain unchanged. The variable `start` is now an integer provided by the user. The value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is the result of that function.
