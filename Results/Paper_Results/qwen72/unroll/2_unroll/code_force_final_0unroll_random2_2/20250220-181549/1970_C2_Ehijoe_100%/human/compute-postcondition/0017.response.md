The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`.

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the total number of nodes.
- `t` is an integer and always equals 1.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node.

The function returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node in exactly `t` steps.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. It returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node in exactly 1 step.**
