The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
  - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
  - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns the minimum cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day is `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices for each day. It returns the minimum cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the daily purchase limit `m`.**
