The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves buying a specified number of tickets `k` over a given number of days `n`, with a maximum of `m` tickets purchasable each day. The function reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case from the standard input. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets by purchasing the cheapest available tickets first, up to the daily limit `m`. After processing each test case, the function ensures that `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost `c` is printed. The variables `n`, `m`, and the list of ticket prices `l` retain their initial values after each test case.
