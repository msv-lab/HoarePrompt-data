You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Program:

    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        s = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves buying a specified number of tickets `k` over a given number of days `n`, with a maximum of `m` tickets purchasable each day. The function reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case from the standard input. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets by purchasing the cheapest available tickets first, up to the daily limit `m`. After processing each test case, the function ensures that `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost `c` is printed. The variables `n`, `m`, and the list of ticket prices `l` retain their initial values after each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest possible price first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes three variables: `t` (the total number of tickets bought so far), `s` (the number of tickets to buy on the current day), and `c` (the total cost).

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The program iterates over each day, from the cheapest to the most expensive.
   - For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy `s` as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day, adjusted by the total number of tickets bought so far `t`.
   - It then updates `t` by adding `s` and decreases `k` by `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all the days, the program prints the total cost `c` for the current test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The program correctly sorts the ticket prices to ensure that tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices first.
  - The program correctly handles the constraint that a person can buy no more than `m` tickets per day.
  - The program correctly updates the total cost by considering the increase in ticket prices due to the tickets bought on previous days.
  - The program ensures that exactly `k` tickets are bought by decrementing `k` and stopping the loop when `k` reaches 0.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all the remaining tickets on the first day.
  - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the ticket purchases over multiple days.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The loop runs in \(O(n)\) time, which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately and efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
