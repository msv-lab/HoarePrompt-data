Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: The ticket prices are sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program always tries to buy tickets at the lowest available price first, which is optimal for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Iterative Purchase**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices, buying as many tickets as possible (up to `m` or `k`, whichever is smaller) on each day. It updates the total cost `c` and the number of tickets `t` that have been bought so far. It also decreases the remaining number of tickets `k` to be bought.

4. **Price Adjustment**: The program correctly adjusts the price for subsequent days by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to the price of the next day. This is done by incrementing `t` by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

5. **Output**: After processing all days or when `k` tickets have been bought, the program prints the total cost `c`.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem requirements, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
