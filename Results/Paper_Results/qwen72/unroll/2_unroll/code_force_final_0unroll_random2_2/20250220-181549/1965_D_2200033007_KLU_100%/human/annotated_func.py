#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a new list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of sublists starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`, sorted in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing the elements from `cts` that appear an odd number of times. The function modifies the list `odds` during its execution, but the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `odds` contains only those elements from `cts` that appear an odd number of times, and all other elements are removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a, n is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, and the length of odds is (n + 1) // 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the corresponding element in `odds`. All other elements in `a` are set to 0.
