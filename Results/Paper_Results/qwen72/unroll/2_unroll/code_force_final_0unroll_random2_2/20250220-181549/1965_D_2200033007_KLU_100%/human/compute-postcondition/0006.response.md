The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds` and `n`. `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of another list `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, and the length of `odds` is (n + 1) // 2.

The function returns the list `a`, where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the element at the middle index of `a` is the corresponding element in `odds`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is the corresponding element in `odds`.**
