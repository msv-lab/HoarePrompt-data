The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the corresponding element in `odds`. All other elements in `a` are set to 0.
