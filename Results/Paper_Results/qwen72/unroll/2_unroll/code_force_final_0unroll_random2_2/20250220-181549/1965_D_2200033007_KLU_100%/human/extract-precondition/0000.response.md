Precondition: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, with bigList containing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and smallList being a subset of bigList. The length of bigList is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) and the length of smallList is less than or equal to the length of bigList.**
