### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an interactive game where you need to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays, each having the same value of \( f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{x=l}^r a_x \).
   - You can make at most \( 2n \) queries to determine the smallest \( r \) for a given \( l \) and \( x \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1:** `func_1()` reads a list of integers from input.
   - **Function 2:** `func_2()` reads a single integer from input.
   - **Function 3:** `func_3()` reads a list of integers from input and returns them as a tuple.
   - **Function 4:** `func_4()` reads a string from input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - **Function 5:** `func_5()` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

3. **Main Function Logic:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the values of \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3()`.
   - **Step 2:** Initialize \( v \) to 1.
   - **Step 3:** Iterate from \( n \) to 1 in reverse order. For each \( i \), make a query to check if \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \). If the response \( v \) is \( n \), set \( v \) to \( i \) and break the loop.
     - This step is intended to find the maximum possible value of \( f(1, r) \) that can be achieved by extending the subarray from the start.
   - **Step 4:** Iterate through possible values of \( i \) from 1 to \( n // k \). For each \( i \), try to split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - Use a nested while loop to make queries to find the smallest \( r \) for each \( l \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - If all \( k \) subarrays can be found, print the answer \( i \cdot v \) and return.
   - **Step 5:** If no valid \( m \) is found, print \(-1\) and return.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Step 3:** The loop is designed to find the maximum possible value of \( f(1, r) \) that can be achieved. However, it only checks \( f(1, r) \) for \( r \) from 1 to \( n \), which might not cover all possible subarrays. This could lead to missing the correct maximum value.
   - **Step 4:** The nested while loop is intended to split the array into \( k \) subarrays. However, the logic for splitting the array is not robust. It assumes that the subarrays can be found by incrementing \( l \) and checking \( f(l, r) \) for each \( i \), but it does not handle cases where the subarray might not exist or where the maximum value might not be consistent across the subarrays.
   - **Step 5:** The program correctly prints \(-1\) if no valid \( m \) is found, but the logic to determine this is flawed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into \( k \) subarrays with the same \( f(l, r) \) value. The logic for finding the maximum possible value of \( f(1, r) \) and the subsequent splitting is not robust enough to ensure correctness in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
