The code snippet `func_2()` calls a function named `func_2`, but since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, assuming `func_2` does not modify the variables `i`, `cnt`, or `l`, the output state will remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i = n // k`, `cnt = 0`, `l = n + 1`.**
