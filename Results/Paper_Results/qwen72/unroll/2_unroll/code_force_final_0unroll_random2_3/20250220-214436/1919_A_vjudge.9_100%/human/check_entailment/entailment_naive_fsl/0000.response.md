Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd to determine the winner. However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

A counterexample is when Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin:
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making the wallets have 1 coin each.
- Bob cannot swap because he would end up with an empty wallet, so he removes a coin from his wallet, making it empty.
- Alice now has 1 coin and Bob has 0 coins. Alice removes a coin from her wallet, making it empty.
- Bob is unable to make a move because his wallet is already empty, so Alice wins.

The program would output "Bob" for this case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
