Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight here is that the game is essentially a turn-based game where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. 

To understand why the parity of the difference is important, consider the following:
- If the difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, then the game will always end in a state where both wallets have the same number of coins, and the player who is forced to make the last move (i.e., when both wallets have 1 coin) will lose. Since Alice goes first, if the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who is forced to make the last move.
- If the difference is odd, then the game will end in a state where one wallet has 1 coin and the other has 0 coins, and the player with 1 coin will be able to force the other player to lose. Since Alice goes first, if the difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and then printing the winner accordingly. The provided execution summary confirms that the program reads the input as expected and processes each test case correctly.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
