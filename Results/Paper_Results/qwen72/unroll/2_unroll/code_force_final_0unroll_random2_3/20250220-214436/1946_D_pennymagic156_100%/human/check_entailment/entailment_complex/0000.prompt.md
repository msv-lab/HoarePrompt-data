Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the user input, where each input value is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input into individual values, converts each value to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function affects the program state by returning this list, which can then be used by the calling code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that the user inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that the user inputs. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has obtained an integer from the user, which can be used in further computations or operations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. The function reads input from the standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers obtained from the space-separated input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the input string after removing any leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a string obtained from user input after removing any leading and trailing whitespace.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.

    #State: `n` and `x` are unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, its length is 0. `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. However, since `a` is empty, `ans` must be 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the maximum count of integers in the list `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. If no such integers exist or if the list `a` is empty after processing, the function returns 0. The function modifies the list `a` and `t` during its execution, but both lists are empty by the time the function concludes. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
