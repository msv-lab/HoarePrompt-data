### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each with a specific input format. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to handle different types of input. However, the main function `func_5` is the one that processes the actual test cases.

2. **Function `func_5`:**
   - The function `func_5` is responsible for solving the problem for each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x` using `func_3`.
   - It reads the array `a` using `func_1`.
   - It initializes two variables: `t` (an empty list) and `ans` (set to -1).
   - The function iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0 and if the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is 0. If both are 0, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0 and the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it is impossible to form a valid segment.
     - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0 and the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is even, it processes the array to find the maximum number of segments that can be formed.
     - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1 and the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1 and the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is even, it processes the array to find the maximum number of segments that can be formed.
   - After processing all bits, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The function correctly uses bitwise operations to check the bits of `x` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses the XOR operation to check the parity of the bits in the array `a` and the OR operation to combine the results of the segments.

4. **Segment Formation:**
   - The function correctly forms segments by iterating over the bits and checking the conditions for the segments to be valid.
   - It ensures that the segments are contiguous and that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the array `a` is empty or where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1 in such cases.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_5` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes the input, checks the conditions for forming valid segments, and returns the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
