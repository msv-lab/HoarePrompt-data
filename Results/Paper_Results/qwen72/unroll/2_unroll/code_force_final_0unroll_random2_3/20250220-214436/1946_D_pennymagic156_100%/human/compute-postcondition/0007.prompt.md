You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `x` are unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, its length is 0. `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. However, since `a` is empty, `ans` must be 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, its length is 0. `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. However, since `a` is empty, `ans` must be 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
