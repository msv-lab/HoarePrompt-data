The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the maximum count of integers in the list `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. If no such integers exist or if the list `a` is empty after processing, the function returns 0. The function modifies the list `a` and `t` during its execution, but both lists are empty by the time the function concludes. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
