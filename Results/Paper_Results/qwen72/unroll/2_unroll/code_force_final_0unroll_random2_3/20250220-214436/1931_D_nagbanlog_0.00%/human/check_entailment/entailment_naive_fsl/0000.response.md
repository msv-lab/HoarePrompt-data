Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements. Specifically, the program counts pairs where `i == j`, which is not allowed according to the problem description. For example, consider the test case:

```
n = 3, x = 2, y = 2, array = [2, 2, 2]
```

According to the problem, the only valid pairs are \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\). However, the program will count the pair \(\langle 1, 1 \rangle\) (which is not valid) multiple times, leading to an incorrect result. The correct output for this test case should be 3 (the pairs \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\), \(\langle 1, 3 \rangle\), and \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\)), but the program will output a higher number due to the incorrect handling of duplicate elements.
