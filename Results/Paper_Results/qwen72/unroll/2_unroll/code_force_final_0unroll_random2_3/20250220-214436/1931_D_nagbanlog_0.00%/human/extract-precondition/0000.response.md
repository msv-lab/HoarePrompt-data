Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
