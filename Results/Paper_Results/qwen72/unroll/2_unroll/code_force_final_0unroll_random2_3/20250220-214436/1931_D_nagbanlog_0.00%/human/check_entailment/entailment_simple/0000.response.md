### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters `n`, `x`, `y` and the array `a`).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from the dictionary, and the array `a` is also extracted.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num % x` and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

4. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` are calculated.
   - The required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated to check if there exists another number in the array such that the pair is beautiful.
     - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x` to ensure that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y` to ensure that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

5. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`, it means there are numbers in the array that form a beautiful pair with the current number `num`. The count of such pairs is added to `beautiful_count`.
   - The frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is updated in the dictionary.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Pair Formation**: The function correctly calculates the required remainders and updates the frequency dictionary. However, it does not explicitly ensure that `i < j` for the pairs. The current implementation counts pairs where `i` and `j` can be in any order, which might lead to overcounting.
- **Overcounting**: The function counts pairs where `i` and `j` can be the same, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. Each pair should be unique and `i` should be strictly less than `j`.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly handle the condition `i < j` and may overcount pairs where `i` and `j` are the same or in the wrong order.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function needs to be modified to ensure that it only counts pairs where `i < j` and avoids overcounting pairs where `i` and `j` are the same.
