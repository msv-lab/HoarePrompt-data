The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`. It returns the difference between the last position in `arr` and the position `times` moves before the last position. If `times` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, it returns the difference between the last position and the first position in `arr`.
