Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correctly solving the problem based on the given description. It uses a combination of prefix and suffix sums to efficiently calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell, taking into account the inversion of the direction characters ('<' and '>') after each move. The logic in the functions and the main loop aligns with the requirements of the problem, and the program is structured to handle multiple test cases as described in the input format. The use of `accumulate` from the `itertools` module is appropriate for building prefix and suffix sums, which are used to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position. The program also correctly handles the inversion of the direction characters and the different cases for movements based on the current character in the grid. Therefore, the program is correct.
