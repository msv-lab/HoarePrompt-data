The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It calculates and prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function does not return any value.
