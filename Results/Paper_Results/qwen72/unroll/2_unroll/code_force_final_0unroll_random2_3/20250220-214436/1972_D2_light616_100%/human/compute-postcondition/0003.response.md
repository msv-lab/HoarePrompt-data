The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. Right before the loop, `x` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6. Since `x` is 1, `x * x` is also 1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.

Given that `n` is already a positive integer, the condition `x * x <= n` will always be true for the first iteration. No adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
