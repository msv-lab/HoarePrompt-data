Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input, processes the list to determine a winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the conditions specified in the loop, and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The internal variables used for processing each test case do not persist outside the loop, and the function does not modify the input variables `t` or `test_cases`. **
