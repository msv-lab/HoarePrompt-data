Reasoning:  
The provided program is almost correct, but there is a small issue with the string `p` used to check the presence and count of each difficulty level. The string `p` is defined as `'ABCDEF'`, which means the program does not account for the difficulty level `'G'`. According to the problem statement, each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level from `'A'` to `'G'`, which means there are 7 difficulty levels, not 6.

To fix this, we need to include `'G'` in the string `p`. The corrected string should be `'ABCDEFG'`.

Let's go through the corrected program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Counter Initialization**: For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s` containing the difficulty levels of the problems.
3. **Counting Missing Problems**: It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level `i` in the string `p` (which now includes `'G'`), it checks if the difficulty level is missing (`i not in hmp`). If it is missing, it adds `m` to the answer because `m` problems of that difficulty level are needed.
   - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m` (`hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer.
5. **Output**: The function prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Verification:
- For the first test case: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - The string `s` contains `'B'`, `'G'`, `'E'`, `'C'`, `'D'`.
  - Missing difficulties: `'A'`, `'F'`.
  - Additional problems needed: 2.
- For the second test case: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - The string `s` contains `'B'` (2 times), `'G'` (2 times), `'E'` (2 times), `'C'` (2 times), `'D'` (2 times).
  - Missing difficulties: `'A'`, `'F'`.
  - Additional problems needed for `'A'` and `'F'`: 2 each.
  - Total additional problems needed: 5.
- For the third test case: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - The string `s` contains `'B'` (3 times), `'C'` (1 time), `'D'` (1 time), `'E'` (1 time), `'F'` (2 times), `'G'` (2 times).
  - Missing difficulty: `'A'`.
  - Additional problem needed: 1.

### Conclusion:
The original program was incorrect because it did not account for the difficulty level `'G'`. After including `'G'` in the string `p`, the program should work correctly for all test cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the missing `'G'` in the string `p`).

Correctness: **True** (after including `'G'` in the string `p`).
