The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the user. It then processes these strings to determine a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is derived by potentially combining parts of the two input strings based on specific conditions. The integer `t` is calculated based on the alignment of a substring from the second input string with a substring from the modified string `s`. Finally, the function prints the modified string `s` and the integer `t`. The function does not return any values.
