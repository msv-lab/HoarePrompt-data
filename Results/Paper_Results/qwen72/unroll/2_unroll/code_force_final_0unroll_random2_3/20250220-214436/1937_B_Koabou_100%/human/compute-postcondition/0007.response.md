The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`a` contains two binary strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
