The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is a list of integers, where each `n[i]` satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The third parameter is a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length `n[i]`, representing a 2 \times n grid for each test case. The sum of all `n[i]` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to transform the first binary string into the second binary string by flipping any 2x2 subgrid any number of times. If the transformation is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a list of integers representing the lengths of binary strings), and a list of tuples (each containing two binary strings of length `n[i]`). It returns a list of strings, where each string is "Yes" if the corresponding test case's first binary string can be transformed into the second binary string by flipping any 2x2 subgrid any number of times, or "No" if the transformation is not possible.**
