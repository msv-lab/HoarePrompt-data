The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n[i] satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length n[i] (representing the 2 \times n grid for each test case). The sum of all n[i] over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
