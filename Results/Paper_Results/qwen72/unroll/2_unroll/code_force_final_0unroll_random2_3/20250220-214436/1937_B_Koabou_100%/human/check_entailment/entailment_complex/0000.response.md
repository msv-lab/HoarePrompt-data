### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads `n` and two binary strings of length `n`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Path Determination:**
   - The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest string by choosing the optimal path.
   - It initializes `s` as an empty list and sets `x` and `y` to 0.
   - It iterates through the grid to find the point where it should switch from the top row to the bottom row to ensure the smallest lexicographical string.
   - The condition `if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` ensures that the program switches to the bottom row as soon as it finds a '1' in the top row and a '0' in the bottom row, which is correct for finding the smallest string.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program then counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string.
   - It initializes `t` to 1 and iterates from `y` to `x` to check if the substring of the bottom row matches the corresponding substring of the modified string `s`.
   - The condition `if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is used to determine if there are multiple valid paths. If the condition is met, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1`, which is the number of valid paths from the point where the condition is met to the end of the string.
   - This logic is also correct for counting the number of paths.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Issues:
- **Initialization of `s`:** The program initializes `s` as an empty list, but it should be a string. This can lead to issues when concatenating strings.
- **Handling the Case Where No Switch is Needed:** If no switch is needed (i.e., the loop does not break), the program should handle this case correctly. The current implementation does not explicitly handle this, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    s = a[0]
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i + 1:]
            x = i + 1
            break
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i + 1
    
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i
            break
    
    print(s)
    print(t)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** with the current implementation due to the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
