Output State: The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop. The length of `results` will be equal to `t`, the number of iterations specified by the user. Each element in `results` corresponds to one iteration of the loop, where 'yes' is appended if `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', and 'no' is appended otherwise. The variables `n` and `arr` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
