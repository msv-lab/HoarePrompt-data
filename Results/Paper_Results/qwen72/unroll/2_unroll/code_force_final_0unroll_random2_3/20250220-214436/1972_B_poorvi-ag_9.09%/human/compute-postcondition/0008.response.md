The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". The function is expected to be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The function returns a result based on the input parameters `n` and `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `s` (a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"). It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `s`.**
