Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are no facing-up coins correctly. According to the problem description, if there are no facing-up coins, the player loses. However, the function `func_1` only checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd or even. It does not account for the scenario where there are no facing-up coins at all, which should result in an immediate loss for the player whose turn it is.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5
DDDDD
```
Expected output:
```
NO
```
Actual output:
```
NO
```
However, the function `func_1` does not explicitly handle this case, and it relies on the modulo operation, which might not be sufficient to capture all edge cases. For instance, if the input is:
```
1
1
D
```
Expected output:
```
NO
```
Actual output:
```
NO
```
The function still returns "NO" because `num_up % 2 == 1` is false, but it does not explicitly check for the case where there are no facing-up coins, which is a specific edge case mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
