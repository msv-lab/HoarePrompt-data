Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined and called at the beginning.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - It then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is used to adjust the count of 1x1 icons. This formula is intended to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the space left for 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)` and adds it to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to adjust the count of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so placing one 2x2 icon leaves 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - The correct formula should be:
     ```python
     x = x - bxsfory * 11
     ```

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct number of screens for each test case based on the adjusted formula.

Given the incorrect formula, the program will not always produce the correct number of screens needed. For example, in the third test case (12 4), the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens.

Correctness: **False**
