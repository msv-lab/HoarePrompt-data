Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect due to a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the formula used is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is flawed. It subtracts the number of 2x2 icons multiplied by 15 (which is the total number of cells in a screen) and then adds the number of 2x2 icons multiplied by 4 (which is the number of cells each 2x2 icon occupies). This does not correctly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - First, calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, calculate the remaining space on the screens. Each screen can have up to 15 - 4 * (number of 2x2 icons on that screen) cells available for 1x1 icons.
   - Finally, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            # Calculate remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
            remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - y * 4
            # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
            x = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
            # Calculate additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
            bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        else:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Step 1**: Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by subtracting the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total number of cells in the screens used for 2x2 icons.
- **Step 3**: Subtract the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space from `x`.
- **Step 4**: Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- **Step 5**: Print the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens used for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

This corrected program should now correctly determine the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem.
