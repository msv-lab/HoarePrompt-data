The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `ap`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ap`. For the loop to execute, `ap` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `k` should be 0, and `ap` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y <= 99, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0**
