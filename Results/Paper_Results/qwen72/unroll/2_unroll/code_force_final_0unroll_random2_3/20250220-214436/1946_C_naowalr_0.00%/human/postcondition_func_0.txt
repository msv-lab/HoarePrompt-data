The function `func_1` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, constructs an adjacency list `adj` representing a tree with `n` vertices, and performs a binary search to determine the maximum value `L` such that the tree can be cut into subtrees of size at least `L` using at most `k` cuts. After processing all test cases, the function prints the value of `L` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` are updated for each test case, and the final state of these variables will be the state after the last test case. The variables `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` are used internally and reset for each test case.
