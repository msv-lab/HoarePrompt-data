The only objects in the loop head are the variables `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `z` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. The variable `z` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0**
