Reasoning:  
The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string using the variables `l` and `h`, respectively. After counting, it compares the counts and prints 'A' if the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, and 'B' otherwise. The variables `l` and `h` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case, ensuring that the counts are accurate for each string.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description:
1. It reads the correct number of test cases.
2. It processes each test case correctly by counting the characters.
3. It prints the correct result for each test case based on the character counts.
4. It handles the constraints (1 <= t <= 32 and all strings are distinct).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
