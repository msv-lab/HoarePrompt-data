The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves a string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and all strings in the test cases are distinct.
