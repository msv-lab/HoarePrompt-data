Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be reduced to 0, and the loop will have printed either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, `l1`, `l2`, `l3`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` will have been modified and used within the loop, but their final values will depend on the input provided during each iteration.**

To break it down further:
- `t` will be 0, as the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration, the loop reads input values for `n` and `m`, and then reads lists `l1` and `l2`.
- The loop checks various conditions and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on those conditions.
- The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` are used to track and manipulate the lists `l1` and `l2` during the iterations.
- The final state of `l1` and `l2` will depend on the specific inputs and the conditions met during each iteration.
