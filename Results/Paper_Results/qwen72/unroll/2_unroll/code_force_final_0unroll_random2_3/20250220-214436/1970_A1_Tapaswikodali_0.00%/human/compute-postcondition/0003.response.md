The objects in the loop head are `i`, `char`, and the string `s`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be true for the loop to start and proceed through at least one iteration.

- `s` is already given as a non-empty string, so it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.
- `i` is the index, which is initialized to 0 by the `enumerate` function.
- `char` will be the first character of the string `s` during the first iteration.

Since `s` is non-empty and consists only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` and `char` can be derived from the `enumerate` function, which starts with `i` as 0 and `char` as the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, adjusted for the loop to execute, is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `char` is the first character of `s`**
