Output State: **The function `min_islands_visitable` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, it prints `n` if `n - k <= 1` and `1` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration, so they are not part of the final output state.**
