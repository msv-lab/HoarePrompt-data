The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_islands_visitable(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
