You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_islands_visitable(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: The function `min_islands_visitable` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, it prints `n` if `n - k <= 1` and `1` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration, so they are not part of the final output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. It then prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input values for `n` and `k` are not retained, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed but still significantly impacts the connectivity of the islands. Specifically, the logic `print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)` is incorrect. This logic suggests that if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, Everule can visit all `n` islands, and otherwise, Everule can only visit 1 island. However, this is not always true.

For example, consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy up to 3 bridges. The program will output `1` for this case, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because Dominater can destroy 3 bridges in such a way that Everule can still visit 2 islands (including island 1).

To correctly solve this problem, the function should determine the minimum number of islands that can be isolated by destroying `k` bridges, which is `max(1, n - k)`. This ensures that Everule can always visit at least one island (island 1) and accounts for the number of islands that can be isolated by the bridges destroyed.
