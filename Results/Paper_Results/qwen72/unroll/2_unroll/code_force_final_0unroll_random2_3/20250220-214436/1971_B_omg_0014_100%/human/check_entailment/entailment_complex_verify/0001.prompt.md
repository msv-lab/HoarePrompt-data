You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES

    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `s` will be the last string input by the user during the loop execution. The variable `a` will be a set containing the unique characters of the last string `s`. The variable `b` will be the last string `s` sorted in ascending order. The variable `c` will be the last string `s` sorted in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of strings to process. For each of the `n` strings, it checks if the string consists of a single unique character. If so, it prints 'NO'. If the string has more than one unique character, it prints 'YES', followed by the string sorted in ascending order if it is not already sorted in ascending order, or the string sorted in descending order if it is sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the variables `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the state of the last processed string: `s` will be the last string input, `a` will be a set of its unique characters, `b` will be the last string sorted in ascending order, and `c` will be the last string sorted in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the unique characters in `s`.

3. **Single Character Check:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to `s`. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in `s`.
   - The program then sorts the string `s` to create a new string `b` and sorts it in reverse to create another string `c`.
   - It checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it means the original string `s` is already in sorted order. In this case, the program prints the reverse sorted string `c` to ensure the new string is different from `s`.
     - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means the sorted string `b` is different from `s`. The program prints `b` as the new string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a valid rearrangement is possible.
   - It prints "NO" if no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Analysis:
- The program handles the case where all characters are the same correctly by printing "NO".
- For strings with at least two different characters, the program ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string by either printing the sorted string or the reverse sorted string.
- The logic is sound and covers all the required cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
