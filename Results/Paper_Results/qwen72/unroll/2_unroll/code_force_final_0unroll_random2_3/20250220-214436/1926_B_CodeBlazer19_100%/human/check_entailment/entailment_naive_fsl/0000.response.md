Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify the shape in scenarios where the number of '1's in a row does not directly correspond to the shape type. For example, consider the following grid:

```
3
000
010
111
```

This grid represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the last row has more than one '1'. The program should check the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine the shape, not just the count of '1's in each row.
