You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The function prints 'TRIANGLE' if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. If no row contains a '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the variables `a` and `b` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads `n` lines of input for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program uses a variable `a` to detect if a row contains exactly one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - The program uses a variable `b` to detect if a row contains more than one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows of the grid, the program checks if `a` is not zero. If `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...). The program only checks if a row has exactly one '1' and sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if it does. This is insufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle.
   - For a square, the program checks if any row has more than one '1' and sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also insufficient because a square has a specific pattern where each row has the same number of '1's, and they are aligned.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, the program should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...).
   - To correctly identify a square, the program should check if each row has the same number of '1's and they are aligned.

Given these flaws, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
