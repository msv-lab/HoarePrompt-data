### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\), but the loop for \(j\) starts from 4 instead of 1, which is incorrect.
   - The condition inside the loop checks if \((j + i) \% (j \cdot \gcd(i, j)) == 0\), which is the correct condition to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the loop for \(j\) should start from 1, not 4, to ensure all valid pairs are considered.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The program then calculates the number of valid pairs using a different approach:
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum \(suma\).
     - Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

5. **Correctness of the Optimization**:
   - The optimization step seems to be derived from a mathematical insight, but it is not clear how it relates to the original problem.
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end (\(suma - 1\)) is also not justified in the context of the problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The optimization step is also flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.
