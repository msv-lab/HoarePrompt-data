The function `func` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. However, we can infer that the function is expected to return some value or values based on the inputs `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value or values based on the inputs `n` and `m`, but the specific output is not provided.**
