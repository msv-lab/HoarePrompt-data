You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():

    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()

                        print(i,j)"""
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        
        print(suma - 1)
        
    #State: The value of `T` is unchanged, and the loop prints the value of `suma - 1` for each iteration of `t` in the range from 0 to `T-1`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`. The function then calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs and prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The values of `n` and `m` are not modified by the function, as they are not used within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\), but the loop for \(j\) starts from 4 instead of 1, which is incorrect.
   - The condition inside the loop checks if \((j + i) \% (j \cdot \gcd(i, j)) == 0\), which is the correct condition to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the loop for \(j\) should start from 1, not 4, to ensure all valid pairs are considered.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The program then calculates the number of valid pairs using a different approach:
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum \(suma\).
     - Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

5. **Correctness of the Optimization**:
   - The optimization step seems to be derived from a mathematical insight, but it is not clear how it relates to the original problem.
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end (\(suma - 1\)) is also not justified in the context of the problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The optimization step is also flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.
