Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. Let's break down the program and check if it correctly handles all the specified conditions:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `1` coin per jewel.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall:
     - `curr = n // i` where `i` is the price of the current stall.
     - It updates `h` (the total number of jewels bought) and `n` (the remaining coins).
   - After the loop, it checks if `h` (the total number of jewels bought) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (`2`) and the prices of the stalls.

4. **Correctness of the General Case**:
   - The prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` are chosen to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This means Alice can buy at most `1` jewel from this stall (since `n - k + 1` is the smallest price that ensures Alice cannot buy more than `1` jewel without exceeding `k`).
   - The second stall is priced at `1` coin per jewel. After buying from the first stall, Alice will have `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins left, which allows her to buy exactly `k - 1` more jewels from the second stall.
   - Therefore, the total number of jewels bought will be `1 + (k - 1) = k`, which is exactly what Bob wants.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `k`.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than `k`.
   - The program correctly handles the general case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k` by ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct: it prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the required details if "YES" is printed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
