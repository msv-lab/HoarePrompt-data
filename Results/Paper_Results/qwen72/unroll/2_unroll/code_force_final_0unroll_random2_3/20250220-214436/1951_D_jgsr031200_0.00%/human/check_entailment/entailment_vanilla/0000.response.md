### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and, if so, provide the number of stalls and their prices.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls and, if so, to print the number of stalls and their prices.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - **Case 1: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
     - The program correctly prints "YES" and the stall setup with a single stall priced at 1.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it's impossible.
     - The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3: General Case**
     - The program initializes `costs` with two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - It then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each of these two stalls.
     - The variable `h` is used to accumulate the total number of jewels bought.
     - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two prices.

4. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The program assumes that setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` will always work if `n >= k`.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `8` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 8 = 1) and 10 - 8 = 2 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 2 jewels from the second stall (2 // 1 = 2).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 2 = 3, which is correct.
   - But if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `7` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 7 = 1) and 10 - 7 = 3 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 3 jewels from the second stall (3 // 1 = 3).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 3 = 4, which is correct.
   - However, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `6` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 6 = 1) and 10 - 6 = 4 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 4 jewels from the second stall (4 // 1 = 4).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 4 = 5, which is correct.
   - The program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin.
   - This guarantees that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each of the first `k` stalls and then stop.
   - If `k > 60`, it is impossible to set up the store as Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where more than two stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. A correct solution would involve setting up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, if `k` is less than or equal to 60, and returning "NO" if `k` is greater than 60.
