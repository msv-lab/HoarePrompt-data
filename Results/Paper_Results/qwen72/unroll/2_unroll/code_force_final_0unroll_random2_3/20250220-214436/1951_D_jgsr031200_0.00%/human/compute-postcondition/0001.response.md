The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints a constant string.

Output: **YES**
