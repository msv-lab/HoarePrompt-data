### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Graph Construction:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads `n-1` edges to construct an undirected tree represented as an adjacency list `nodes`.
   - The function correctly identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`.

2. **Starting Node and Game Logic:**
   - The function reads the starting node `start` for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` with the adjacency list `nodes` and the starting node `start`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the current node `start` is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, and that neighbor is the parent).
   - If the current node is a leaf node, it returns `False` because the player who moves to a leaf node loses.
   - If the current node is not a leaf node, it recursively checks all its children (excluding the parent) to see if any of them can be moved to in such a way that the opponent loses.
   - The function returns `True` if any of these recursive calls return `False`, indicating that there is a move that forces the opponent to lose. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, the function prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means Ron can make a move that forces Hermione to lose, so 'Ron' is printed.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means Ron cannot make a move that forces Hermione to lose, so 'Hermione' is printed.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly constructs the tree and identifies leaf nodes.
- The recursive function `func_1` correctly implements the game logic by checking if the current node is a leaf node and, if not, recursively checking its children.
- The program correctly determines the winner based on the result of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
