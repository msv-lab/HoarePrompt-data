### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `numCases` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `numInteger` and the list of integers `numbers`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly remove pairs of integers from the list. Since the list is sorted, the smallest two numbers will always be the first two elements.
   - It then adds the minimum of these two numbers to the score `suma`.
   - This process continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the function prints the score `suma`.

### Analysis:

- **Optimality:**
  - By sorting the list in ascending order, the function ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together. This is optimal because the minimum of each pair will always be the smaller number, and by pairing the smallest numbers first, we maximize the sum of the minimums.
  - For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the pairs will be `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`, and the score will be `1 + 3 = 4`, which is the maximum possible score.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where the list has only two elements correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all elements are the same, as seen in the third test case.

- **Correctness:**
  - The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
  - It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct maximum score for each test case.
