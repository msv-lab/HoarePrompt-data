You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first differing character between `a` and `b` has been swapped if `a` was initially less than `b`. The flag `f` is set to 1 if any swap occurred or if `a` was greater than `b` at any point. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `a` are printed in the same order as they are in the list after any potential swaps that occurred based on the initial state. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the flag `f` retains its value from the initial state.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `b` are printed in the same order as they are in the list. The variables `x`, `y`, `t`, and the flag `f` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It also accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
