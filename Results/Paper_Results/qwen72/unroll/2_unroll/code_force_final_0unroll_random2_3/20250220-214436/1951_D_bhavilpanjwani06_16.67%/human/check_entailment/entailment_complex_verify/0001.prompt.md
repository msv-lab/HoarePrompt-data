You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.

If `n` is equal to `k`, the current tuple satisfies this condition. Otherwise, if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition.

If `n` < `k`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. If `n` ≥ `k`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `k`. If `n` = `k`, the current tuple satisfies this condition. Otherwise, if `k - 1` < `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. If `k - 1` ≥ `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` does not satisfy the condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It then checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and prints one of the following outputs based on the conditions:
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` and the value of `n`.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2`, and then the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, it prints 'NO'. 

The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them, calling `func_1()` for each test case. This is a standard way to handle multiple test cases in Python.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

3. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO". This check is correct.

4. **Exact Match Check**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with the price `n`. This ensures that Alice buys exactly one jewel and spends all her coins, which is correct.

5. **Greedy Strategy Check**: The program then checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is a bit tricky, but it essentially checks if Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at a higher price and then buy the last jewel at a lower price. If this condition is true, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and another with the price `1`. This ensures that Alice buys `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, which is correct.

6. **Final Check**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO". This is the fallback case where it is determined that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:

- **Flaw in Greedy Strategy**: The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not the correct way to determine if it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This condition only checks if Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at a higher price and 1 jewel at a lower price, but it does not consider other possible configurations of prices that could also work.

- **Correct Approach**: To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin. This way, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought exactly `k` jewels. This approach is always possible as long as `n >= k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not consider the correct approach for setting up the stalls.

Correctness: **False**
