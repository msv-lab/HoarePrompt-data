The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- `n` and `k` are the input integers, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `k` is such that `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

The `print` statement:
```
print(2)
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
