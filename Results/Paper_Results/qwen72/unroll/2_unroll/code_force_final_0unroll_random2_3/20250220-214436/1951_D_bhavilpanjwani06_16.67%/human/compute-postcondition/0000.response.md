Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` and `k` are the input integers.**

The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the user input, which are both positive integers.
