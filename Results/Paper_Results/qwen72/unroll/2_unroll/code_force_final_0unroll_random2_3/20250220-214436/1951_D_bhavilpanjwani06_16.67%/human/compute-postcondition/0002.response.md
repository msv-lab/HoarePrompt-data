Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- `n` and `k` are the input integers.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed in this statement, just a constant string.

Output: **NO**
