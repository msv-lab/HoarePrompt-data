You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        
        flag = 0

                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        
        print(length)
        
        print(*s)
        
    #State: The loop will print the length of the modified binary representation of `x` and the modified binary string for each iteration of `nalla` in the range `t`. The variables `x`, `t`, and the list `s` will be modified within the loop, but the final state of `x` and `t` will be the same as their initial state after the loop completes, and `s` will be the final modified binary string for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to operate with a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30, but the specific output or behavior based on `x` is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
