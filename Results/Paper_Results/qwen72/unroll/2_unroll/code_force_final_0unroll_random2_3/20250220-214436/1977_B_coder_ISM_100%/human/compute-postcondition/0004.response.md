Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `1 â‰¤ x < 2^30`. The function then converts `x` into a binary string of length 30, modifies this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself. The modifications involve flipping certain bits and potentially extending the length of the binary string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that the input values `x` and `t` are unchanged, but the list `s` contains the final modified binary string for the last test case. **
