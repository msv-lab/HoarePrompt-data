You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop will print the length of the modified binary representation of `x` and the modified binary string for each iteration of `nalla` in the range `t`. The variables `x`, `t`, and the list `s` will be modified within the loop, but the final state of `x` and `t` will be the same as their initial state after the loop completes, and `s` will be the final modified binary string for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `1 ≤ x < 2^30`. The function then converts `x` into a binary string of length 30, modifies this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself. The modifications involve flipping certain bits and potentially extending the length of the binary string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that the input values `x` and `t` are unchanged, but the list `s` contains the final modified binary string for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `x` is 15. According to the problem description, the array should not have consecutive non-zero elements. However, the program's output for `x = 15` is:

```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```

This output is incorrect because the sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 does not equal 15. The correct output should be something like:

```
5
-1 0 -1 0 1
```

This is because:
-1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + -1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 = -1 + 0 - 4 + 0 + 16 = 11

But the correct sum for 15 should be:
-1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + -1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 = -1 + 0 - 4 + 0 + 16 = 11

The program fails to correctly adjust the array to meet the requirement that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
