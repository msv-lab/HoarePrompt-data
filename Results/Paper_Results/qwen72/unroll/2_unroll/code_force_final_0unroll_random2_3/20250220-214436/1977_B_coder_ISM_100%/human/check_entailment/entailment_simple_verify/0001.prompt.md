You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15

Output

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop will print the length of the modified binary representation of `x` and the modified binary string for each iteration of `nalla` in the range `t`. The variables `x`, `t`, and the list `s` will be modified within the loop, but the final state of `x` and `t` will be the same as their initial state after the loop completes, and `s` will be the final modified binary string for the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with possible adjustments for the constraints.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program iterates over the range from 0 to 29 (since \( x < 2^{30} \)).
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set using the bitwise AND operation `x & pow(2, i)`.
   - If the bit is set, it appends '1' to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The program uses a flag to manage the adjustment of the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.
   - It iterates through the list `s` from index 0 to 28 (inclusive).
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the current element to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is not set and the current element and the next element are both '1', it changes the current element to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is not '0', it changes the current element to '0'.
   - If the flag is set after the loop, it checks the last element (index 29):
     - If it is '0', it changes it to '1'.
     - If it is not '0', it changes it to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program iterates through the list `s` from index 1 to the new length.
   - If it finds an element '-1' followed by '1', it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the list `s`.
   - It then prints the elements of the list `s`.

### Analysis:
- **Binary Representation**: The initial binary representation is correct, but it needs to be adjusted to meet the constraints.
- **Adjusting for Constraints**: The logic for adjusting the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:
  - The flag logic is complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
  - The final adjustments to ensure no '-1' followed by '1' are not necessary and may introduce errors.

### Correctness:
- The program's approach to converting the integer to a binary representation and then adjusting it is generally on the right track.
- However, the flag logic and the final adjustments are overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical issues in the way it handles the flag and the final adjustments, which may lead to incorrect outputs for some test cases. A simpler and more robust approach would be to directly construct the array while ensuring the constraints are met.
