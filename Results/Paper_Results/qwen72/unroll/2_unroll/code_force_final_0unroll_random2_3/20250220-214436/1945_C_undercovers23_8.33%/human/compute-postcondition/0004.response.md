Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It then finds the smallest index (1-based) in the string `s` where the prefix up to that index has at least 50% '0's and the suffix from that index onwards has at least 50% '1's. If no such index exists, it outputs 0 if the entire string has at least 50% '1's, and `n` otherwise. The function does not return any value; it prints the result for each test case. **
