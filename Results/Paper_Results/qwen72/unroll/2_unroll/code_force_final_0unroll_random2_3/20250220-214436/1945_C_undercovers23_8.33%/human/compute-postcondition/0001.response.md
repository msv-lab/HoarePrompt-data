The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `_` is 0**
