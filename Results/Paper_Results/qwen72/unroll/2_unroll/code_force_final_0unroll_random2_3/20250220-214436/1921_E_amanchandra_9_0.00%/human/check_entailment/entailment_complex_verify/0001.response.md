### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)` respectively.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if xa > xb` correctly identifies a draw when Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip. This is because Alice cannot move down and Bob cannot move up, so they cannot meet.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The calculation `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` is correct for determining the number of moves it would take for both players to potentially meet.

4. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice's chip is correct: `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is intended to check if Alice can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x + 1` moves. However, this condition is incorrect. It should check if Alice's chip can be within the range `l` to `r` after `x` moves, not `x + 1` moves. The correct condition should be `l <= ya <= r`.

5. **Even Distance Case:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Bob's chip is incorrect. It should be `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is incorrect. It should check if Bob's chip can be within the range `l` to `r` after `x` moves. The correct condition should be `l <= ya <= r`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[l <= ya <= r])
            else:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[l <= ya <= r])
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the conditions for determining the winner.
- The corrected program correctly checks if Alice or Bob can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in the appropriate number of moves.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
