Output State: **The loop will execute `casos` times, and for each iteration, it will print a pattern based on the value of `n` provided. If `n` is 1, it will print two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it will print four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it will print six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it will print eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it will print 'No esta en el rango'. The value of `c` will be `casos - 1` after the loop finishes, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided. The value of `casos` remains unchanged.**
