You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. For each iteration, an integer n is provided such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

    #State: The loop will execute `casos` times, and for each iteration, it will print a pattern based on the value of `n` provided. If `n` is 1, it will print two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it will print four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it will print six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it will print eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it will print 'No esta en el rango'. The value of `c` will be `casos - 1` after the loop finishes, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided. The value of `casos` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `n` from the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function prints a specific pattern of '##' and '.' characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `casos` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only explicitly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any \( n \) outside of these values, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. According to the problem description, the program should handle any \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). Therefore, the program is incorrect for any \( n \) greater than 4. For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program will not produce the correct checkerboard pattern.
