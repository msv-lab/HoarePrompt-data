Output State: **s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string.**

The code snippet initializes `s2` as an empty string, which was not previously defined. The values of `s`, `k`, `n`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
