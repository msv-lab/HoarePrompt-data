You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n`. It processes `s` to create a string `s1` that contains each of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets from `s` at most once, and a string `s2` that consists of the last character from `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`), and the string `s2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` becomes empty (all characters in the set have been used), it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and gets the result `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False` (i.e., not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`), it appends "No" to the output list `OUT`.
   - It then finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character to append to `s2`.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends "Yes" to `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets whenever it becomes empty, which means it does not correctly track the subsequences.
  - The variable `s1` is used to build a string of characters that are in the set `alphabet`, but it does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
  - The variable `s2` is used to build a string of characters after `alphabet` becomes empty, but it does not help in determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- The logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
