Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is intended to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not achieve this goal.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `alphabet` Set**:
   - The `alphabet` set is used to track the characters that have not yet been seen in the string `s`. However, the set is reset to all characters whenever it is reduced to a single character, which is not the correct approach to check for subsequences.
   - The set `alphabet` should be used to track the characters that need to be seen in the correct order to form a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `r`**:
   - The variable `r` is calculated as `len(s1) // k`, but this does not help in determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences is not correctly implemented.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `s2`**:
   - The string `s2` is constructed by appending characters to it when the `alphabet` set has only one character left. This does not help in checking if a specific string of length `n` is a subsequence.
   - The string `s2` is not used correctly to determine the missing subsequence.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program appends 'No' and a constructed string to the `OUT` list, but the constructed string is not guaranteed to be a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - The program does not correctly identify a missing subsequence when the answer is 'No'.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings are not found as a subsequence, you should output 'No' and the missing string. If all strings are found, you should output 'Yes'.
