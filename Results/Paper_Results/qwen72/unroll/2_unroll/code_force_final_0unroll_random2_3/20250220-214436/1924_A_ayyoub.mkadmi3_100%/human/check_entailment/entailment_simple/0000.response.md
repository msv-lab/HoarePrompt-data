### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains more than one character, the character is removed from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains only one character, it is added to `s2` and the set is reset to its initial state.
   - The function then calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
     - The string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If the boolean value returned by `func_1` is `False`, it appends "No" to the `OUT` list and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by repeating a character not in `s1` (if any) or the last character in `s2` (if all characters from the initial set are in `s1`).
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the `OUT` list.
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Subsequence Check**:
  - The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
  - However, the logic used in `func_1` is flawed. The function only checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
  - The function should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of them is a subsequence of `s`.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `2 2 4`, `abba`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Actual Output: `YES`
  - The function correctly identifies that all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`) are subsequences of `abba`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `2 2 3`, `abb`
  - Expected Output: `NO`, `aa`
  - Actual Output: `NO`, `aa`
  - The function correctly identifies that the string `aa` is not a subsequence of `abb`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3 3 10`, `aabbccabab`
  - Expected Output: `NO`, `ccc`
  - Actual Output: `NO`, `ccc`
  - The function correctly identifies that the string `ccc` is not a subsequence of `aabbccabab`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. It only checks the length of `s1` and does not generate and check all possible strings of length `n`.

### Correctness:
**False**
