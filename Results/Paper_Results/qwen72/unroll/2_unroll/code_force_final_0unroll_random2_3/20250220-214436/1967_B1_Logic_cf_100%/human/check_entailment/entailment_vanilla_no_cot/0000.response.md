Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The condition that needs to be satisfied is:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the line:
```python
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```
does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) values. The correct way to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the answer `ans` to 0.
3. **Nested Loops**: It iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), it iterates over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
4. **Condition Check**: For each pair \((a, b)\), it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) using the modulo operation.
5. **Count Valid Pairs**: If the condition is satisfied, it increments the answer `ans`.
6. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, it prints the answer.

This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly. However, it may not be efficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\) due to the nested loops. A more optimized approach would be needed to handle the constraints efficiently.
