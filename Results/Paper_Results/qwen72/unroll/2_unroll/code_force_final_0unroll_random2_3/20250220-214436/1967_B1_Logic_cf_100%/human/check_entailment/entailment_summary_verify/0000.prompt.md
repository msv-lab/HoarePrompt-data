You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a specific formula and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `t` unchanged, and the final values of `n` and `m` will be those from the last test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. This line is trying to add a value to `ans` that does not correspond to the number of valid pairs for a given `b`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`

The expected output is `3` (pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)). However, the program will produce a different output because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current program does not do this correctly.
