Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. This line is trying to add a value to `ans` that does not correspond to the number of valid pairs for a given `b`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`

The expected output is `3` (pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)). However, the program will produce a different output because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current program does not do this correctly.
