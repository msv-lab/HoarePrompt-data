### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the logic to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For each `b`, it updates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
The formula used in the loop is `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this formula does not correctly implement the condition specified in the problem.

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition is that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This means:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

### Issues with the Formula:
- The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the loop is incorrect and does not match the required condition.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
