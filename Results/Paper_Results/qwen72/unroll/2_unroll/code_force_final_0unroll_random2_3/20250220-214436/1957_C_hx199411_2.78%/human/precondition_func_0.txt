t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves is represented by a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, ensuring that no two rooks attack each other. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
