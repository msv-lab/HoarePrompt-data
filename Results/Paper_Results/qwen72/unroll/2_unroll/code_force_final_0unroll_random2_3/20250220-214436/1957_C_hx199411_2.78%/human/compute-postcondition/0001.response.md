The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that `t` is non-zero and the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves is represented by a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, ensuring that no two rooks attack each other. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
