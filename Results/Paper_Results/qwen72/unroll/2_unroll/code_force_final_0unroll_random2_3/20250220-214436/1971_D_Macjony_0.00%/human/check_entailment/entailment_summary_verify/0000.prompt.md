You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'), it calculates the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if a specific transition ('0' to '1') is found. The function then prints the adjusted count for each string. After processing all `t` strings, the final value of `t` remains unchanged, and the last value of `s` is the last input string provided. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string has multiple consecutive '1's followed by '0's correctly. For example, consider the input "111000". The correct output should be 2, as you can cut the string into "111" and "000" and rearrange them to get "000111". However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
1. The program initializes `count` to 1 and `flag` to False.
2. It iterates through the string, incrementing `count` whenever it encounters a change in characters.
3. If it finds a transition from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to True and skips the next character.
4. After the loop, if `flag` is True, it decrements `count` by 1.

For the string "111000":
- The program will increment `count` at the transition from '1' to '0' (at index 2).
- It will not set `flag` to True because the transition is from '1' to '0'.
- The final `count` will be 3, which is incorrect.

The correct logic should be to count the number of '1's that appear before any '0' and the number of '0's that appear after any '1'. The minimum number of pieces needed is the sum of these counts plus one, to account for the initial piece.
