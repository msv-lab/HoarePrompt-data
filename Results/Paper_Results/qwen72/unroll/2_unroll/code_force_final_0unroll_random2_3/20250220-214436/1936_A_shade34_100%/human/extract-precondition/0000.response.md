Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through a series of queries. The sequence p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find the indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize p_i ⊕ p_j. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
