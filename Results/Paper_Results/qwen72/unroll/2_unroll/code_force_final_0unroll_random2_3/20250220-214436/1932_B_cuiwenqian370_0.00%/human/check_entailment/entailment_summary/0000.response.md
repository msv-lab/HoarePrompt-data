Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The solution involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, but with a twist: the signs must occur in a specific sequence, and the waiting period for the next sign starts immediately after the previous sign occurs.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input**: A list of strings `path` where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character.
- **Output**: The maximum value in a derived list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function initializes a `dp` list of length `n` (the length of `path`).
  - If the first character in `path` is '@', `dp[0]` is set to 1.
  - If the first character is '*', `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`.
  - For each subsequent character in `path`, the function updates `dp[i]` based on the maximum of the previous two values in `dp` and adds 1 if the current character is '@'.
  - The function returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than `-inf`.

However, this function does not solve the problem described. The function `func_1` is designed to solve a different problem, likely related to a path or sequence where '@' and '*' have specific meanings, but it does not calculate the year of the n-th sign of the apocalypse.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input**: Reads from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
- **Output**: Prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function reads the input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes `t` test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `path`, and applies `func_1` to `path`.
  - The results of `func_1` are collected and printed.

### Conclusion:
- **`func_1`**: This function does not match the problem description. It is designed to solve a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the periodic occurrence of signs.
- **`func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases, but it incorrectly uses `func_1` to solve the problem.

The correct approach to solve the problem would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, ensuring that the signs occur in the correct sequence. The provided functions do not implement this logic.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
