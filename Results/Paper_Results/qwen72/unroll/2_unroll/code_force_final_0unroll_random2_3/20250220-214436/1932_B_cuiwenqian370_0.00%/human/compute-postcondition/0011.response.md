Functionality: ** The function reads from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, and each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`. It applies `func_1` to each `path` and prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
