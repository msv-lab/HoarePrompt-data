Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the functions are designed to handle a path with characters `@` and `*`, which is not related to the problem at hand.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. Calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iterating through the signs and finding the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(a):
    year = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        year = (year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]
    return year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, as required by the problem statement.
