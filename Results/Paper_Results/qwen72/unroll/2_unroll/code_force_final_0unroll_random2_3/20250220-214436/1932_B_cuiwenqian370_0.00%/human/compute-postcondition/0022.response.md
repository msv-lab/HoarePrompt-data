The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character. The function returns 0 if the path is such that all elements are '*' or if any other condition that leads to a return of 0 is met. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated based on the following conditions: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.

Otherwise, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity, calculated based on the rules: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.**
