Output State: **`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 1; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1 and `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf` and `dp[1]` is set to `-inf` if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0 and `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. The second element of `path` is not '*'.**
