The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It then processes each integer in the list, updating a dictionary `dic` and a variable `ans`. The function prints the value of `ans` after processing each integer in the list. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the final values of `times`, `check`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, and `ans` after the last iteration. The function does not modify the input `t` or the list of lists containing the test cases.
