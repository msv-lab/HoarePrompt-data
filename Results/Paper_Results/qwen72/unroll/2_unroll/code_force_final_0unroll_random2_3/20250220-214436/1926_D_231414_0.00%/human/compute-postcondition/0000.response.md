Output State: **The function should take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) non-negative integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `times` is an input integer.**
