### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. This conversion is necessary because the problem involves counting and manipulating the characters in the string.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of `0`s in the binary string `s`. This is important because the cost of shifting a `1` to the right of a `0` is dependent on the number of `0`s in the string.

3. **Tracking Counts and Calculating Cost:**
   - The list `cnt` is used to keep track of the counts of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `0` and is used to accumulate the total cost of the operations needed to sort the string.
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is `0`, it increments the count of `0`s in `cnt` and adds `1` to `ans` if there are any `1`s before this `0` (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is `1`, it increments the count of `1`s in `cnt` and adds the number of `0`s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the function prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the positions of `0`s and `1`s.
- The cost is calculated by ensuring that each `1` is moved to the right of all `0`s, and the cost of each move is the length of the substring being shifted.
- The logic of adding `1` to `ans` when a `0` is encountered and there are `1`s before it, and adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` when a `1` is encountered, ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the optimal shifts.

### Edge Cases:
- **Already Sorted String:** If the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`), the algorithm correctly outputs `0` because no shifts are needed.
- **String with Only One Type of Character:** If the string contains only `0`s or only `1`s (e.g., `1111`), the algorithm correctly outputs `0` because no shifts are needed.
- **General Case:** The algorithm works correctly for general cases by dynamically calculating the cost based on the current counts of `0`s and `1`s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The state of the program and the logic within the loop are consistent with the problem description.
