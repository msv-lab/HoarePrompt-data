You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not provide the necessary parameters to solve the problem as described. The function should take a binary string `s` as an input parameter.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a new binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, and compute the value of `ans` based on the number of zeroes and ones in the list. The final value of `ans` for each iteration will be printed. The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset to their initial states at the beginning of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The variable `zeroes` is initialized to count the number of zeros in the string `s`.

3. **Initialization of Counters**:
   - The list `cnt` is initialized to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to zero, which will store the minimum total cost to sort the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The function iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
   - If the character is `0`:
     - It increments `ans` by 1 if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`), indicating that a zero is following a one, which requires a shift to move the zero to the left.
   - If the character is `1`:
     - It increments `ans` by the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`), indicating the cost to move all remaining zeros to the left of the current one.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of making the string sorted by counting the number of zeros that need to be moved to the left of each one.
  - The cost is calculated by summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move zeros to the left of ones.
  - The logic ensures that the minimum number of shifts is performed by only considering the necessary moves.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the algorithm correctly outputs `0` because no shifts are needed.
  - If the string has a mix of zeros and ones, the algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(|s|)\) for each test case, where \(|s|\) is the length of the string.
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the counters and the answer variable.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the cost.

Correctness: **True**
