Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, if the input string is "0000", the program should output 0, as no operations are needed. However, the current implementation will still calculate a non-zero cost, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program does not reset the `ans` variable to 0 if the string is already sorted, leading to an incorrect result.
