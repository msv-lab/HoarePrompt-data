The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of zeroes and ones in the list. The final value of `ans` for each binary string is printed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
