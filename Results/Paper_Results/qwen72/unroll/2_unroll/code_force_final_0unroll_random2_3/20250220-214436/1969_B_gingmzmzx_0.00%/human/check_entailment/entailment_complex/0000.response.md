Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The approach taken by the program is to count the number of zeroes and ones in the string and use these counts to calculate the cost of sorting the string.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is initialized to the count of zeroes in the string `s`.

3. **Counting Substring Operations:**
   - The variable `cnt` is a list of two elements, `[0, 0]`, where `cnt[0]` keeps track of the number of zeroes encountered so far, and `cnt[1]` keeps track of the number of ones encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and will store the total cost of the operations.

4. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`) before the current position.
   - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The logic of the program is based on the idea that the cost of sorting the string can be minimized by considering the transitions between 1s and 0s.
- For each 0 encountered, if there are any 1s before it, it will cost 1 to move the 0 past the 1s.
- For each 1 encountered, the cost is the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved past the 1s to sort the string.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1: "10"**
  - `zeroes = 1`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 2` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: "0000"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1-4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 0]` -> `ans = 0` (because `cnt[1] = 0`)
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: "11000"**
  - `zeroes = 3`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1-2: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 2]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 3: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 1` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Iteration 4-5: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 2]` -> `ans = 9` (because `zeroes - cnt[0] = 3 - 1 = 2` for the 4th iteration, and `3 - 2 = 1` for the 5th iteration)
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: "101011"**
  - `zeroes = 2`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 1` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Iteration 3: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 1`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 3` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Iteration 5-6: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 4]` -> `ans = 5` (because `zeroes - cnt[0] = 2 - 2 = 0` for the 5th and 6th iterations)
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: "01101001"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 0]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2-3: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 2` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Iteration 5: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 3]` -> `ans = 2`
  - Iteration 6-7: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 3]` -> `ans = 6` (because `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - Iteration 8: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [4, 4]` -> `ans = 11` (because `zeroes - cnt[0] = 4 - 4 = 0`)
  - Output: `11` (Correct)
