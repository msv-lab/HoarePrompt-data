You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: needed_problems is the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string a at least m.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a` at least `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold \( m \) rounds. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems \( n \) and the number of rounds \( m \), followed by the string \( a \) representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems**: The program initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') with zeros. It then iterates through the string \( a \) and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character. This correctly counts the number of problems for each difficulty level.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of problems for a particular difficulty level is less than \( m \), it adds the difference \( m - \text{count}[i] \) to `needed_problems`. This ensures that for each difficulty level, there are at least \( m \) problems available.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- It correctly handles the case where \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \).
- It correctly handles the case where \( n \) is much larger than \( m \).
- It correctly handles the case where \( n \) is less than \( 7 \times m \) (i.e., there are not enough problems of any difficulty level to meet the requirement).

Since the program meets the requirements for every potential case, it is correct.
