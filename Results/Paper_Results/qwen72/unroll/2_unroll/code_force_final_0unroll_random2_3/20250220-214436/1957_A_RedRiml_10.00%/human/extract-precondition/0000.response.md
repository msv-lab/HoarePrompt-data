Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the stick lengths for a test case.
