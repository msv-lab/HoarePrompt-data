The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `w`. The loop will execute based on the value of `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default in the `range(w)` function.

State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
