Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` (1 ≤ ln ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks, followed by a list of `ln` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in each test case and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The variables `w`, `t`, and the list of lists remain unchanged, and the internal variables `d`, `pl`, and `shapes` are reset for each test case. **
