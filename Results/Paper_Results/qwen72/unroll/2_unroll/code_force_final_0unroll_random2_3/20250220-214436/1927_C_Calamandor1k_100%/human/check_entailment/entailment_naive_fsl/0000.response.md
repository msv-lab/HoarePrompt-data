Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of the arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. The program follows these steps:

1. For each test case, it reads the input values \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), and the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
2. It creates sets of unique elements from \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
3. It calculates the sets of elements that are only in \(a\), only in \(b\), and in both \(a\) and \(b\).
4. It checks if the number of unique elements only in \(a\) or only in \(b\) exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), in which case it is impossible to choose the required elements.
5. It checks if the total number of distinct elements (from both sets and the intersection) is less than \(k\), in which case it is also impossible to choose the required elements.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements and appends "YES" to the results list. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
