Functionality: ** The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `prices` and `bonuses` of length `n`. It calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting up to `k` items, where the profit of each item is determined by its price and bonus. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the internal variables are reset for each test case. **
