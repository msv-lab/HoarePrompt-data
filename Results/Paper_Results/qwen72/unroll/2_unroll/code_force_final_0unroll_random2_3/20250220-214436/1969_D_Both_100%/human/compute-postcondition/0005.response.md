Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains one integer representing the price of an item for Bob. The function returns the total sum of prices for Bob from `secondary_heap` and the sum of prices for both Alice and Bob from `primary_items`, but only includes items where the sum of the prices for each item is non-negative. **
