t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, a, b). n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. a and b are lists of integers of length n, where each element a_i and b_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
