No variables are directly passed to `func_4()`. However, the function relies on the outputs from `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()`. `func_1()` returns the number of test cases `test_cases` as a non-negative integer. `func_2()` is called twice in each test case: the first call returns two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= n`, and the second call returns lists of integers `prices` and `bonuses` each of length `n` with values in the range `1 <= price, bonus <= 10^9`.
