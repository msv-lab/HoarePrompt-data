### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads and processes the input for each test case, converting space-separated strings into lists of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` processes each test case by reading the number of items `n` and the number of free items `k`.
   - It reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`).
   - It creates a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice and the price for Bob. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap (which is implemented as a max-heap in Python by using negative values).

3. **Sorting and Heap Operations**:
   - The `combined` list is sorted based on the price for Bob (`item[1]`).
   - It pushes the first `k` items into a heap, which will be the items Bob can take for free.
   - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3` with the remaining items and the heap.

4. **Optimal Selection**:
   - The function iterates through the remaining items and updates the current profit by considering the effect of adding or removing items from the heap.
   - It uses `heapq.heappushpop` to maintain the heap size and ensure that the most beneficial items are kept for Bob to take for free.
   - The maximum profit is updated if the current profit is greater than the previously recorded maximum profit.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing the prices for Bob from the heap and the combined prices for Alice and Bob from the remaining items, but only includes items where the sum of the prices is non-negative.

### Analysis:
- The approach of using a heap to keep track of the `k` items Bob can take for free is correct. This ensures that Bob always takes the least profitable items for Alice.
- The sorting of the `combined` list based on Bob's prices ensures that the most profitable items for Bob are considered first.
- The use of `heapq.heappushpop` to maintain the heap and update the profit is appropriate for this problem.
- The function `func_3` correctly calculates the total profit by summing the relevant values and applying the condition that only non-negative combined prices are included.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine Alice's profit when both Alice and Bob act optimally. The use of heaps and sorting ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
