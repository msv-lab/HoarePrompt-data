### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an encoded integer `n` which is the sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to `n`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The encoded integer `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
   - Each letter's position ranges from 1 to 26.

3. **Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should try to use the smallest possible letters (i.e., 'a' with position 1) as much as possible.
   - If the remaining value of `n` is still large after using the smallest possible letters, we should use the largest possible letters (i.e., 'z' with position 26) to minimize the number of large letters used.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then uses a loop to determine the positions of the first two letters:
     - If `lex` (the encoded value) is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - Finally, it converts the positions in `arr` to characters and prints the resulting word.

5. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The logic for determining the positions of the first two letters is flawed. The conditions `if lex < 28` and `elif lex < 52` are not sufficient to handle all cases correctly.
   - For example, if `lex` is 27, it should be split into 1, 1, and 25 (i.e., 'a', 'a', and 'y'), but the program incorrectly appends 26 and 1, resulting in 'a', 'z', and 1, which is not lexicographically smallest.
   - The program should use a more systematic approach to distribute the remaining value of `lex` among the three letters to ensure the smallest possible letters are used.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases to find the lexicographically smallest word. The conditions used to determine the positions of the letters are insufficient and can lead to incorrect results.
