You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, followed by t integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded words.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is still an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, where each sublist is sorted and contains three elements: two elements are either 1, 26, or 52 (depending on the initial value of `lex`), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop has completed its iterations.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: The `cases` variable remains unchanged, `n` remains an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, and `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists. Each sublist in `info` is sorted and contains three elements: two elements are either 1, 26, or 52 (depending on the initial value of `lex`), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop has completed its iterations. Additionally, the loop prints a string for each sublist in `info`, where the string is composed of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in the sublist (converted to lowercase letters by adding 96 to each element).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and `t` integers `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78), and returns a list of decoded words corresponding to each `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
