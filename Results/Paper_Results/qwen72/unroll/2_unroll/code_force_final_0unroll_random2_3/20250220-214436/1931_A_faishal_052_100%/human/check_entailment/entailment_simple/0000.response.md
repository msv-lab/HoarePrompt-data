### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `cases` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded value of a three-letter word.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - The function then iterates twice to determine the first two letters of the word:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - This is necessary because the smallest word is determined by the smallest values of the letters.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function constructs a string `temp` by converting the elements of `arr` to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.
   - The function then prints `temp`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Decoding Logic**:
  - The logic for decoding the integer `lex` into a three-letter word is flawed. The conditions `if lex < 28`, `elif lex < 52`, and `elif lex <= 78` do not correctly handle all possible values of `lex`.
  - For example, if `lex` is 24, the function will append two 1s and then 22, resulting in the list `[1, 1, 22]`. However, the correct lexicographically smallest word for 24 is "aav" (which corresponds to `[1, 1, 22]`), but the function should ideally handle this more robustly.

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting the list `arr` ensures that the smallest possible letters are used first, which is correct for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

- **Character Conversion**:
  - The conversion from integer positions to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` is correct, as it correctly maps the integer 1 to 'a', 2 to 'b', and so on.

### Conclusion:

The program is **not** correct because the decoding logic does not handle all possible values of `lex` correctly. Specifically, the conditions for appending values to `arr` are too restrictive and do not cover all cases where the lexicographically smallest word should be found.

### Correctness: **False**
