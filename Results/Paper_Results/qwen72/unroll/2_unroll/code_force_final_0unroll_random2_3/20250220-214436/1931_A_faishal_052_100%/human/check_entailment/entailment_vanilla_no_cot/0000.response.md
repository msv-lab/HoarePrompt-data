Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographically Smallest Word**:
   - The program attempts to construct the word by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value (26) from the encoded number, which is not the correct approach to find the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The correct approach should be to start with the smallest possible values and adjust as needed to ensure the sum matches the encoded number.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - The logic for constructing the word is flawed. For example, when `lex` is 24, the program incorrectly appends 1, 1, and 22, which results in "aav" instead of the correct "cat".
   - The program should ensure that the sum of the three values equals the encoded number and that the word is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `lex` is 3, the program should output "aaa" but it incorrectly outputs "aaa" by appending 1, 1, and 1.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, you should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter to ensure the sum matches the encoded number. If the sum is still too large, you should increment the second letter and adjust the third letter accordingly. Finally, if needed, increment the first letter and adjust the second and third letters.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three letters with the smallest possible values
        a, b, c = 1, 1, lex - 2
        # Ensure the values are within the valid range (1 to 26)
        while c > 26:
            c -= 25
            b += 1
        while b > 26:
            b -= 25
            a += 1
        # Convert the values to characters and print the result
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Example Test Cases:
- For `lex = 24`, the correct output is "cat" (1 + 3 + 20 = 24).
- For `lex = 70`, the correct output is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
- For `lex = 3`, the correct output is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
- For `lex = 55`, the correct output is "czz" (3 + 26 + 26 = 55).
- For `lex = 48`, the correct output is "auz" (1 + 21 + 26 = 48).

The given program does not produce the correct results for these test cases, hence it is incorrect.
