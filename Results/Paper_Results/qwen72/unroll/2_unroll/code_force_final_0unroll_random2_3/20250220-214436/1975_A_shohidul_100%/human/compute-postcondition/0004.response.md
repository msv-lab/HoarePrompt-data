Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `t`, `n`, and `a` from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if the list `a` of `n` integers is either non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. If the list meets either of these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop. **
