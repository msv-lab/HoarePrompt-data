### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `check_all` variable.
   - If `a` is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Finding the Split Point:**
   - If `a` is not sorted, the program attempts to find a split point `i` where the array can be divided into two parts: `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`.
   - It checks if the suffix `y` is non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix `y`.

4. **Conditions for 'YES':**
   - The program should print 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the operation.
   - The current logic checks if the suffix `y` is non-decreasing and if the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `y`.

5. **Conditions for 'NO':**
   - The program should print 'NO' if the array cannot be made non-decreasing by performing the operation.
   - The current logic breaks out of the loop and prints 'NO' as soon as it finds a split point where the conditions are not met.

6. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The program only checks the first split point where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and immediately prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met.
   - This is incorrect because there might be other split points that could make the array non-decreasing.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach should be to check all possible split points and only print 'NO' if none of them can make the array non-decreasing.
   - The program should iterate through all possible split points and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it only checks the first split point where the array is not sorted and immediately prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met. This approach fails to consider other possible split points that could make the array non-decreasing. The correct approach should be to check all possible split points and only print 'NO' if none of them can make the array non-decreasing.
