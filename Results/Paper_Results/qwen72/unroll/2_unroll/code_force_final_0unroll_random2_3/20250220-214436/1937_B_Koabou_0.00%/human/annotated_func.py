#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples grid where each grid[i] contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. The total sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input integers, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `s` contains the concatenated string from `a[0]` up to the first occurrence of '1' in `a[0]` and the rest of the string from `a[1]` starting from the position where `a[1]` has a '0', or if no such condition is met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` is the index where the condition was met or `n-1` if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` remains unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable `s` as defined in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It then checks for the first position where the second string has a '0' and the first string has a '1' immediately after it. If such a position is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the first part of the first string up to that position with the rest of the second string. If no such position is found, `s` is the concatenation of the first string and the last character of the second string. The function also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the prefix of `s`. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `grid`.
