You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples grid where each grid[i] contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. The total sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input integers, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `s` contains the concatenated string from `a[0]` up to the first occurrence of '1' in `a[0]` and the rest of the string from `a[1]` starting from the position where `a[1]` has a '0', or if no such condition is met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` is the index where the condition was met or `n-1` if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` remains unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable `s` as defined in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It then checks for the first position where the second string has a '0' and the first string has a '1' immediately after it. If such a position is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the first part of the first string up to that position with the rest of the second string. If no such position is found, `s` is the concatenation of the first string and the last character of the second string. The function also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the prefix of `s`. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `grid`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. Specifically, the variable `t` is used to count the number of paths, but the logic for updating `t` is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for all possible paths that can yield the lexicographically smallest string.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0010
0000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
00000
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, which can be achieved by two paths: 
  1. Moving right, right, down, right.
  2. Moving down, right, right, right.
- However, the program only counts one path, which is incorrect.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple paths can yield the same lexicographically smallest string.
