You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples grid where each grid[i] contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. The total sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input integers, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `s` contains the concatenated string from `a[0]` up to the first occurrence of '1' in `a[0]` and the rest of the string from `a[1]` starting from the position where `a[1]` has a '0', or if no such condition is met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` is the index where the condition was met or `n-1` if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` remains unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable `s` as defined in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples `grid` where each `grid[i]` contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the two binary strings in the grid can be transformed into each other by flipping any number of columns, and "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
