### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x` to 0.
   - It iterates through the grid to find the first position `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'.
   - If such a position is found, it constructs the lexicographically smallest string by concatenating the prefix of `a[0]` up to `i` and the suffix of `a[1]` starting from `i`.
   - If no such position is found, it constructs the string by concatenating `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1.
   - It then iterates through the grid to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The logic for counting paths is flawed. The program should count the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell while following the lexicographically smallest string. However, the current logic does not correctly handle this.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t`.

### Issues:
- **Path Counting Logic:**
  - The current logic for counting paths is incorrect. The variable `t` is not being updated correctly to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
  - The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a similar method to count the number of valid paths that follow the lexicographically smallest string.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest string in most cases.
- However, the path counting logic is flawed and does not produce the correct number of paths.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
