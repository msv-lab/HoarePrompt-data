The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
  - `m`: an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
  - `k`: an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the price per ticket on each day. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. It returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the price per ticket on each day and the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.**
