### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes variables `t`, `s`, and `c` to 0.
     - `t` is intended to keep track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
     - `s` determines the number of tickets to purchase on the current day.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost of the tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - For each day, it determines the number of tickets to purchase (`s`) as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets needed).
   - It then calculates the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day, taking into account the increase in price due to previous purchases (`t`).
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the current day's purchases.
   - The total number of tickets purchased `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The remaining number of tickets needed `k` is decreased by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program's approach is to always buy the cheapest available tickets first, which is a greedy strategy. This is correct because buying cheaper tickets first will minimize the total cost.
  - However, there is a critical issue in the program: the variable `t` is used to track the total number of tickets purchased, but it is also used to increase the price of tickets. This is incorrect because the price increase should be based on the number of tickets purchased on previous days, not the total number of tickets purchased so far.

- **Price Increase Calculation:**
  - The price increase for subsequent days should be based on the cumulative number of tickets purchased up to the previous day, not the total number of tickets purchased so far. This means that the price increase should be calculated as the sum of tickets purchased on each day, not the total `t`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all remaining tickets on the first day.
  - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by purchasing `m` tickets on each day until `k` tickets are purchased.

- **Performance:**
  - The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
  - The loop that purchases tickets runs in \(O(n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the price increase for subsequent days. The price increase should be based on the cumulative number of tickets purchased up to the previous day, not the total number of tickets purchased so far.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, you should maintain a separate variable to track the cumulative number of tickets purchased up to the previous day. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        cumulative_tickets = 0
        while k > 0:
            for i in range(n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
                total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (l[i] + cumulative_tickets)
                cumulative_tickets += tickets_to_buy
                k -= tickets_to_buy
        print(total_cost)
```

This version correctly calculates the price increase for subsequent days and ensures that the total cost is minimized.
