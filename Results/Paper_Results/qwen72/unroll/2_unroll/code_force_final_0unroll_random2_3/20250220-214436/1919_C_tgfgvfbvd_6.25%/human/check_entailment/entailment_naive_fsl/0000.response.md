Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is already in non-increasing order. In such a case, the optimal split would be to put all elements in one subsequence, resulting in a penalty of 0. However, the program does not account for this and may incorrectly calculate a non-zero penalty.

Example Input:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
The program will output a non-zero penalty, which is incorrect.
