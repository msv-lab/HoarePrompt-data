The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters. It separates the digits and letters from the password into two sorted lists. The function returns `True` if the password is already sorted in non-decreasing order of digits followed by non-decreasing order of letters. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
