### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array itself `case`.
   - It converts the input string `case` into a list of integers `a`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function includes a check for `num2 > 10000` and prints a fixed value `16668` if this condition is met. This is incorrect because the problem constraints guarantee that `1 <= n <= 10^5` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function correctly calculates the index of the median element `ma` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - It then initializes `median` to the current median value in the sorted array `b`.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The function enters a loop to increment the median element until it is greater than the current median.
   - It increments `b[ma]` by 1, increases the operation count `op` by 1, and sorts the array `b` again.
   - This loop continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The check for `num2 > 10000` is incorrect and unnecessary.
- **Sorting in Loop**: Sorting the array `b` inside the loop is inefficient. The array should be sorted once, and then the necessary elements should be incremented without re-sorting.
- **Median Increment Logic**: The logic for incrementing the median element is flawed. It only increments the element at the median index, which may not be the most efficient way to increase the median. Instead, it should increment the smallest element that is less than or equal to the current median until the median is increased.

### Correct Approach:
- **Sort the Array Once**: Sort the array `b` once before entering the loop.
- **Increment the Correct Element**: Increment the smallest element that is less than or equal to the current median until the median is increased.
- **Remove Unnecessary Edge Case**: Remove the check for `num2 > 10000`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            next_ma = int(num2 / 2)
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
            next_ma = ma
        median = b[ma]
        next_median = b[next_ma]
        if median == next_median:
            next_median += 1
        op = 0
        while b[ma] < next_median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
        print(op)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting Once**: The array `b` is sorted once before entering the loop.
- **Correct Median Increment**: The loop increments the element at the median index `ma` until it is greater than or equal to the next median value `next_median`.
- **Efficiency**: This approach avoids re-sorting the array in each iteration, making it more efficient.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary edge case handling and inefficient sorting in the loop. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem.
