Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly prints a fixed value `16668` and breaks the loop if the length of the array `num2` is greater than 10000. This is not a valid solution and does not handle the problem as described.

2. **Median Calculation**: The program attempts to increase the median by repeatedly incrementing the element at the median index and then re-sorting the array. This approach is inefficient and does not necessarily find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not consider the optimal way to increase the median. For example, it should increment the smallest elements that are less than or equal to the current median to the next possible value that would increase the median.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are the same.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Sort the array.
- Identify the median index.
- Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
- Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the median equal to this number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        if n % 2 == 1:
            median_idx = n // 2
        else:
            median_idx = n // 2 - 1
        
        median = a[median_idx]
        next_median = median + 1
        operations = 0
        
        # Find the next median
        for i in range(median_idx, n):
            if a[i] >= next_median:
                break
            operations += next_median - a[i]
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This program correctly handles the problem by:
- Sorting the array.
- Identifying the median index.
- Calculating the minimum number of operations required to increase the median to the next possible value.
