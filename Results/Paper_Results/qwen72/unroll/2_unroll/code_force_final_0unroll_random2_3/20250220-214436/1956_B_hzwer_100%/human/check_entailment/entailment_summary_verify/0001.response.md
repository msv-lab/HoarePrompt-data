### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, each with integers from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - Players take turns placing one card on the table, and if the card's integer is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If you have a card with an integer x that appears twice in your hand, you can score a point by placing the first card and then the second card.
   - If you have a card with an integer x that appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it because Nene will place her matching card before you do.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards n and the list of integers a in your hand.
   - It initializes a count array `cnt` of size n+1 to keep track of how many times each integer appears in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list a and increments the count for each integer.
   - It then calculates the maximum number of points you can score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in the `cnt` array. This is because if an integer x appears twice in your hand, you can score one point by placing both cards.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - Nene will always play optimally, which means she will place her cards in such a way that she maximizes her score and minimizes yours.
   - The program's logic correctly accounts for the fact that you can score a point for each integer that appears twice in your hand, as Nene cannot prevent you from scoring those points.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where an integer appears only once in your hand by not adding any points for it.
   - It also handles the case where an integer appears twice by adding one point for it.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is O(n) for the count array, which is also efficient.

### Verification of Function Summary:
- The function summary states that the function processes `t` test cases, reads `n` and `a` for each test case, and calculates the number of integers in `a` that appear more than once.
- The function prints the results for each test case and does not return any value.
- The input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function.

### Systematic Evaluation:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.

- **Count Array:**
  - The count array `cnt` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each integer in your hand.
  - The array is correctly updated by incrementing the count for each integer in `a`.

- **Point Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in the `cnt` array.
  - This logic ensures that you score a point for each integer that appears twice in your hand.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of points you can score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by taking your turns optimally, considering Nene's optimal play. The function summary and the code align with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
