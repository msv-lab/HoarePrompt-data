You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` function is now set to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of integers in the list `a` that appear more than once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of integers in `a` that appear more than once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, each with integers from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - Players take turns placing one card on the table, and if the card's integer is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If you have a card with an integer x that appears twice in your hand, you can score a point by placing the first card and then the second card.
   - If you have a card with an integer x that appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it because Nene will place her matching card before you do.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards n and the list of integers a in your hand.
   - It initializes a count array `cnt` of size n+1 to keep track of how many times each integer appears in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list a and increments the count for each integer.
   - It then calculates the maximum number of points you can score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in the `cnt` array. This is because if an integer x appears twice in your hand, you can score one point by placing both cards.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - Nene will always play optimally, which means she will place her cards in such a way that she maximizes her score and minimizes yours.
   - However, the program's logic correctly accounts for the fact that you can score a point for each integer that appears twice in your hand, as Nene cannot prevent you from scoring those points.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where an integer appears only once in your hand by not adding any points for it.
   - It also handles the case where an integer appears twice by adding one point for it.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is O(n) for the count array, which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by taking your turns optimally, considering Nene's optimal play. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
