Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` function is now set to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of integers in the list `a` that appear more than once.**
