The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` function is now set to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
