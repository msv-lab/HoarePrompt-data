Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in the player's hand.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies**: It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each card in the player's hand. This is necessary because each card value can appear at most twice.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**: The program iterates through the `cnt` list and for each card value `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer `ans`. This calculation is correct because:
   - If a card value `x` appears 0 times in the player's hand, `max(0, 0 - 1)` is 0, so no points are added.
   - If a card value `x` appears 1 time in the player's hand, `max(0, 1 - 1)` is 0, so no points are added.
   - If a card value `x` appears 2 times in the player's hand, `max(0, 2 - 1)` is 1, so 1 point is added. This is the maximum number of points the player can get for that card value, assuming Nene plays optimally.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated answer `ans` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the player maximizes their points by playing optimally, and it correctly accounts for the fact that Nene will also play optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. Therefore, the program is correct.
