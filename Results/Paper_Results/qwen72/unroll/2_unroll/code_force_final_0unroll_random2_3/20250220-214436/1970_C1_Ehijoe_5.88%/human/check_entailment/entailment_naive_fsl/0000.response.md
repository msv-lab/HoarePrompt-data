Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is not a simple linear structure but has branches. The logic for constructing the tree in `func_1` assumes a linear structure, which is not always the case for a tree with exactly two leaves. For example, consider a tree with the following edges:

```
1 2
2 3
2 4
4 5
```

This tree has nodes 1 and 5 as leaves, but it is not a simple linear structure. The program will incorrectly build the tree and may lead to incorrect results when determining the number of moves from the starting node. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
