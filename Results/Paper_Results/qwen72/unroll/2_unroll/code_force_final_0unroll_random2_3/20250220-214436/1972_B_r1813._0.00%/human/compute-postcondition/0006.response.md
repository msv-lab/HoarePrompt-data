The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop indicates that `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, but for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `results` is an empty list**
