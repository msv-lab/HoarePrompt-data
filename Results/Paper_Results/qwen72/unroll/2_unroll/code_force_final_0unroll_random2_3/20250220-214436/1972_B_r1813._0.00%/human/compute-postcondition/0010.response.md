The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `coins_state`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `coins_state` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D", representing the state of the coins.

The function returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the number of coins that need to be flipped to make all coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `coins_state`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of coin flips required to make all coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction.**
