The function `solve_coin_game` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function should be able to read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and the subsequent test case inputs from the standard input.
