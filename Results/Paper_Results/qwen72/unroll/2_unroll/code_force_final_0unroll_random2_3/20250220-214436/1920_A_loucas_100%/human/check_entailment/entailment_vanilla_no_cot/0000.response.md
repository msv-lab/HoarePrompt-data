Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the constraints, and calculates the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \) and then reads \( n \) lines of constraints.

2. **Constraint Categorization**:
   - The program categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the range of valid \( k \) values by finding the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`.
   - It computes the number of integers in this range using the formula `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program then iterates through the `no` list to exclude any specific values that fall within the calculated range.
   - It decrements the count of valid \( k \) values for each such value.

5. **Output**:
   - If the calculated number of valid \( k \) values is less than 1, it prints 0.
   - Otherwise, it prints the final count of valid \( k \) values.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the solution is accurate for the given problem description.
