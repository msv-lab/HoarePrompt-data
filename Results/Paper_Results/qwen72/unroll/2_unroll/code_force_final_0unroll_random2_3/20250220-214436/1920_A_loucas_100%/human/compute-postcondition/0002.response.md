Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` will be different for each test case based on the inputs provided. However, the variables `t`, `n`, and `loop` will remain unchanged. The output of the loop will be the number of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case, or 0 if no such integers exist.**
