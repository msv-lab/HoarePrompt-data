Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) within a test case are distinct.**
