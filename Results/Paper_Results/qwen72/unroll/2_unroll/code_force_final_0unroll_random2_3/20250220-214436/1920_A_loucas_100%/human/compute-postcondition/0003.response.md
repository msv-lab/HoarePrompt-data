The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes a number of test cases, `t`, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a set of `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer within the specified range. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a set of `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
