### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the length of the array `c` and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes it to create a prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - The prefix sum array `p` is correctly constructed by iterating through the array `c` and accumulating the sums.
   - This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula `p[r] - p[l-1]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the indices `a` and `b` (which correspond to `l_i` and `r_i` in the problem description).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - The function checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1, which should always result in 'NO' because there cannot be a different positive integer `b_i` for a single-element subarray.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the subarray sum is less than twice the length, which should result in 'NO'.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of the prefix sum array ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions and efficiently processes the queries. Therefore, the program is correct.
