The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which means the loop condition `i <= 1000` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 1, the function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9.**
