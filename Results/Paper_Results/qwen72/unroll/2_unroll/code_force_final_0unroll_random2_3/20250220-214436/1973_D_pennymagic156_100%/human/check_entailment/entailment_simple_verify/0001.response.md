### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum value equal to \( m \).
   - We are allowed to make at most \( 2n \) queries to determine the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_2**: Reads a single integer from input. This function is used to read the responses from the queries.
   - **func_3**: Reads two integers from input and returns them as a tuple. This function is used to read the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - **func_4**: Reads a string from input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_5**: This is the main function that implements the solution.

3. **Main Function (func_5) Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3()`.
   - **Finding the Maximum Possible \( m \):**
     - It initializes \( v \) to 1.
     - It iterates from \( n \) down to 1, making a query for each \( i \) to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \).
     - If the response \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The loop correctly identifies the maximum possible value \( m \) by checking \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1.
       - If \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it means \( i \cdot n \) is a valid \( m \) and it sets \( v \) to \( i \).
       - The state after this loop is that \( v \) is the largest integer \( i \) such that \( i \cdot n \) results in \( n \) when passed to `func_2()`. If no such \( i \) is found, \( v \) remains 1.
   - **Checking Possible Values of \( m \):**
     - It then iterates from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \) to check possible values of \( m \).
     - For each \( i \), it initializes \( cnt \) to \( k \) and \( l \) to 1.
     - It makes queries to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - If it successfully finds \( k \) subarrays that satisfy the condition and \( l \) reaches \( n + 1 \), it prints the answer \( i \cdot v \) and returns.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \( i \) and makes the necessary queries.
       - If it finds a valid split, it prints the answer and returns.
       - The state after this loop is that the program has either found a valid \( m \) and printed it, or it has not found a valid \( m \) and will proceed to the next step.
   - **Handling No Valid \( m \):**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found after the loop, it prints \(-1\) and returns.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The program correctly handles the case where no valid \( m \) is found by printing \(-1\).

4. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Possible \( m \):**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the maximum possible value \( m \) by checking \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1.
     - If \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it means \( i \cdot n \) is a valid \( m \) and it sets \( v \) to \( i \).
   - **Checking Possible Values of \( m \):**
     - The second loop checks if there exists a valid split of the array into \( k \) subarrays such that each subarray has \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - It correctly iterates over possible values of \( i \) and makes the necessary queries.
     - If it finds a valid split, it prints the answer and returns.
   - **Handling No Valid \( m \):**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) correctly, as it will always find a valid \( m \) equal to \( f(1, n) \).
   - The program also handles the case where no valid \( m \) exists by printing \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It follows the constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately. The annotations and the original assessment are accurate.

Final: **True**
