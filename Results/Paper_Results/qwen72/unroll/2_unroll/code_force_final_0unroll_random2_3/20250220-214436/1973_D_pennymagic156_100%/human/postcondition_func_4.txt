The function `func_5` interacts with two other functions, `func_3` and `func_2`, to perform a series of queries and potentially print a final result. It starts by obtaining two positive integers `n` and `k` from `func_3` such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`. It then searches for the largest integer `i` in the range `[1, n]` such that `i * n` results in `n` when passed to `func_2`. If such an `i` is found, `v` is set to this value; otherwise, `v` remains 1. Next, the function iterates over a range from `1` to `n // k` and for each value of `i` in this range, it performs a series of queries in the format `? l i*v` where `l` starts from 1 and increments by the value returned by `func_2` + 1 until `l` reaches `n + 1` or the count `cnt` reaches 0. If the conditions are met, it prints a final statement `! i*v` and returns. If no such conditions are met, it prints `! -1` and returns. The function does not return any value.
