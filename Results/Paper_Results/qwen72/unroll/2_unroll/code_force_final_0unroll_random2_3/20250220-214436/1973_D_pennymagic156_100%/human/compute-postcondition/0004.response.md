The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. For the loop to execute, the range function should generate at least one value for `i`. This depends on the expression `n // k + 1` being greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n // k + 1`.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, the minimum value of `n // k` is 1 (when `k` is 1 and `n` is 1), and the maximum value is `n` (when `k` is 1 and `n` is at its maximum, 10^4). Therefore, `n // k + 1` will always be at least 2, ensuring that the loop will always execute at least once as long as `n` and `k` meet the given conditions.

The variable `v` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the state of `v` is provided to give context, but it does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `n` and `k` are such that `n // k + 1` is greater than 1, which is already guaranteed by the conditions 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1**
