You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Fox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,
\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \leq a_i \leq n for every i . Now they
are going to play the following game:

For any two integers l, r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , define f(l, r) =
(r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal
to the maximum of the subarray a_l, \ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.

Cat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two
integers l and x (1 \leq l \leq n, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him
one integer p as the answer — the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,
r) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.

Now, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence
c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \leq c_1 < \ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)
= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he
should indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is
always equal to f(1, n) .

In other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the
array into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the
beginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of
their length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m
exists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.

Cat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.

Interaction

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1
\leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the hidden array and the number of
subarrays in the desired split.

Now you are allowed to make queries in the following way — print one line of
the form "\mathtt{?} \ l \ x " (it must hold that 1 \leq l \leq n , 1 \leq x
\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \leq r
\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.

If you want to print the answer, output "\mathtt{!} \ m " and you will recieve
1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the
interaction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer
doesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't
receive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to
read whether your answer to the last test case was correct.

If you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an
invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your
program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the
output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4
.

Hacks

The format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain
one integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases should follow.

The first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \leq k
\leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you
want to split it into.

The second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i
\leq n ).

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

    ! 6

Note

The hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,
1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer
is -1 .

The answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r
exists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \cdot \max(1, 3) =
6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.

The sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so
it received 1 after each answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` interacts with two other functions, `func_3` and `func_2`, to perform a series of queries and potentially print a final result. It starts by obtaining two positive integers `n` and `k` from `func_3` such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`. It then searches for the largest integer `i` in the range `[1, n]` such that `i * n` results in `n` when passed to `func_2`. If such an `i` is found, `v` is set to this value; otherwise, `v` remains 1. Next, the function iterates over a range from `1` to `n // k` and for each value of `i` in this range, it performs a series of queries in the format `? l i*v` where `l` starts from 1 and increments by the value returned by `func_2` + 1 until `l` reaches `n + 1` or the count `cnt` reaches 0. If the conditions are met, it prints a final statement `! i*v` and returns. If no such conditions are met, it prints `! -1` and returns. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum value equal to \( m \).
   - We are allowed to make at most \( 2n \) queries to determine the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_2**: Reads a single integer from input. This function is used to read the responses from the queries.
   - **func_3**: Reads two integers from input and returns them as a tuple. This function is used to read the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - **func_4**: Reads a string from input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_5**: This is the main function that implements the solution.

3. **Main Function (func_5) Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3()`.
   - **Finding the Maximum Possible \( m \):**
     - It initializes \( v \) to 1.
     - It iterates from \( n \) down to 1, making a query for each \( i \) to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \).
     - If the response \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Possible Values of \( m \):**
     - It then iterates from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \) to check possible values of \( m \).
     - For each \( i \), it initializes \( cnt \) to \( k \) and \( l \) to 1.
     - It makes queries to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - If it successfully finds \( k \) subarrays that satisfy the condition and \( l \) reaches \( n + 1 \), it prints the answer \( i \cdot v \) and returns.
   - **No Valid \( m \) Found:**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found after the loop, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Possible \( m \):**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the maximum possible value \( m \) by checking \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1.
     - If \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it means \( i \cdot n \) is a valid \( m \) and it sets \( v \) to \( i \).
   - **Checking Possible Values of \( m \):**
     - The second loop checks if there exists a valid split of the array into \( k \) subarrays such that each subarray has \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - It correctly iterates over possible values of \( i \) and makes the necessary queries.
     - If it finds a valid split, it prints the answer and returns.
   - **Handling No Valid \( m \):**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) correctly, as it will always find a valid \( m \) equal to \( f(1, n) \).
   - The program also handles the case where no valid \( m \) exists by printing \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It follows the constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
