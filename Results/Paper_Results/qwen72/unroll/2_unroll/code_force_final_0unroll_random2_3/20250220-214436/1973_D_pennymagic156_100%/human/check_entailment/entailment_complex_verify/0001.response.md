### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum value equal to \( m \).
   - We are allowed to make at most \( 2n \) queries to determine the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_2**: Reads a single integer from input. This function is used to read the responses from the queries.
   - **func_3**: Reads two integers from input and returns them as a tuple. This function is used to read the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - **func_4**: Reads a string from input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in the provided program.
   - **func_5**: This is the main function that implements the solution.

3. **Main Function (func_5) Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3()`.
   - **Finding the Maximum Possible \( m \):**
     - It initializes \( v \) to 1.
     - It iterates from \( n \) down to 1, making a query for each \( i \) to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \).
     - If the response \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The loop correctly identifies the maximum possible value \( m \) by checking \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1.
       - If \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it means \( i \cdot n \) is a valid \( m \) and it sets \( v \) to \( i \).
   - **Checking Possible Values of \( m \):**
     - It then iterates from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \) to check possible values of \( m \).
     - For each \( i \), it initializes \( cnt \) to \( k \) and \( l \) to 1.
     - It makes queries to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
     - If it successfully finds \( k \) subarrays that satisfy the condition and \( l \) reaches \( n + 1 \), it prints the answer \( i \cdot v \) and returns.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The loop correctly checks possible values of \( m \) by iterating over \( i \) and making the necessary queries.
       - It correctly increments \( l \) by the value returned by `func_2() + 1` and decrements \( cnt \).
       - If it finds a valid split, it prints the answer and returns.
   - **Handling No Valid \( m \):**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found after the loop, it prints \(-1\) and returns.
     - **Annotation Validation:**
       - The program correctly handles the case where no valid \( m \) exists by printing \(-1\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) correctly, as it will always find a valid \( m \) equal to \( f(1, n) \).
   - The program also handles the case where no valid \( m \) exists by printing \(-1\).

5. **Query Limit:**
   - The program makes at most \( 2n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - **Annotation Validation:**
     - The first loop makes \( n \) queries.
     - The second loop makes at most \( n \) queries in the worst case, ensuring the total number of queries does not exceed \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It follows the constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately. The annotations confirm that the program's logic and behavior are as intended.

Final: **True**
