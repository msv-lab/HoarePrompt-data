Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for k excursions. The expected value is calculated as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the program outputs \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads `m` tuples, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Calculating the Total Initial Friendship Value:**
   - The program initializes `sum_f` to 0.
   - It iterates over the `m` tuples and adds the initial friendship values `f_i` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of pairs `cn2` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Calculating the Numerator and Denominator:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` using the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values over the excursions.
   - The program calculates the denominator `q` using the formula:
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) and prints it.

### Verification of the Formula:
- **Initial Friendship Values:**
  - The initial sum of friendship values is `sum_f`.
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for the first excursion is \(\frac{m \cdot \text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}}\).

- **Increase in Friendship Values:**
  - For each subsequent excursion, the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1.
  - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \(\frac{m}{\text{cn2}}\).
  - Over `k` excursions, the total expected increase in friendship value is:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{m \cdot i}{\text{cn2}} = \frac{m}{\text{cn2}} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{m}{\text{cn2}} \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
    \]
  - Simplifying, the total expected increase is:
    \[
    \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}
    \]

- **Total Expected Value:**
  - The total expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is:
    \[
    \frac{m \cdot \text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}
    \]
  - Combining the terms, we get:
    \[
    \frac{2 \cdot m \cdot \text{sum_f} \cdot k + m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2}
    \]
  - This matches the formula used in the program:
    \[
    p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
    \]

### Edge Cases:
- **No Friends (m = 0):**
  - If there are no friends, `sum_f` is 0, and the expected value is 0, which the program correctly handles.
- **Single Pair of Friends (m = 1):**
  - The program correctly calculates the expected value for a single pair of friends, as shown in the example test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and uses the appropriate mathematical formulas to calculate the expected value and its modular inverse.

Correctness: **True**
