### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is correctly computed as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula needs to be verified. The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) represents the contribution of the initial friendship values to the expected value over `k` excursions.
   - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) represents the contribution of the increased friendship values due to the pairs being chosen multiple times. However, this term should be divided by the total number of pairs, which is \( \binom{n}{2} \), to get the correct expected value.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the friendship value will increase linearly.

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula for the expected value should be:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
  \]
- The current implementation in the program is:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
  \]
- The denominator should be \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}\), not \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\).

### Corrected Formula:
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
  \]
- This simplifies to:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
  \]

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the formula used in the program is incorrect. The denominator should be \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}\), not \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\).

Final: **False**
