### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to understand the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`: Number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions.
   - `m` lines of `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`: Pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be broken down into two parts:
     - The initial friendship values.
     - The increase in friendship values due to the excursions.

   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values.

   - The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion is \(\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

   - Therefore, the correct formula for the expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot \sum f + \binom{k}{2} \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
     where:
     - \(\sum f\) is the sum of the initial friendship values.
     - \(\binom{k}{2} = \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \(k\).
     - \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \(n\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing up the initial friendship values in `sum_f`.

2. **Calculating \(\binom{n}{2}\):**
   - The program calculates \(\binom{n}{2}\) as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).

5. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` and then prints the result of \((p \cdot q^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Correctness of the Formula:
- The formula used in the program:
  \[
  p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
  \]
  \[
  q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
  \]

- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot \sum f + \binom{k}{2} \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}}
  \]
  where:
  \[
  \binom{k}{2} = \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
  \]

- The program's formula is incorrect because it multiplies \(\binom{n}{2}\) by 2 in both the numerator and the denominator, which is unnecessary and leads to an incorrect calculation.

#### Example Verification:
- For the test case \(n = 3\), \(m = 1\), \(k = 2\), and the initial friendship value of the only pair being 1:
  - Correct expected value:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot 1 + \binom{2}{2} \cdot 1}{\binom{3}{2}} = \frac{2 + 1}{3} = 1
    \]

  - Program's calculation:
    \[
    p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18
    \]
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \frac{14}{18} = \frac{7}{9}
    \]

  - The program's result is \(\frac{7}{9} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. The formula used in the program is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
