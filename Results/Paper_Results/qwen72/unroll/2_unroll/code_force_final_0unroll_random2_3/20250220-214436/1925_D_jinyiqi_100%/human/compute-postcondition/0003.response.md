Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, then reads `m` tuples of integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input. After processing these inputs, it calculates and prints the result of the formula `(2 * k * n * (n - 1) // 2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // (2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2) % M`, where `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values in the `m` tuples, and `M` is 1000000007. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are reset for each iteration of the loop.**
