You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format as input. The hour (hh) ranges from 00 to 23, and the minute (mm) ranges from 00 to 59. The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: The loop will print the time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' for each iteration, based on the input time and the value of `n`. The variables `h`, `m`, and `day` will be updated in each iteration, but the initial input string `s` and the integer `n` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s` which is a string representing a valid time in the 24-hour format (hh:mm). It returns the time as a string in the same format.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
