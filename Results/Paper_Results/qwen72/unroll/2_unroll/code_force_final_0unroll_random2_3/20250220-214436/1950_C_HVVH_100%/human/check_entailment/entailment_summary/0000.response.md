Reasoning:  
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads a time in 24-hour format, converts it to 12-hour format, and prints the result. The program correctly handles the conversion logic for most cases, but there is a potential issue in the handling of the `day` variable. Specifically, the `day` variable is set to 'AM' at the beginning of the function and is only changed to 'PM' if the hour is greater than 12 or exactly 12. However, the `day` variable is not reset to 'AM' for each test case, which could lead to incorrect results if the first test case is 'PM' and subsequent test cases are 'AM'.

To ensure correctness, the `day` variable should be reset to 'AM' at the start of each iteration in the loop. This way, the program will correctly determine whether the time is 'AM' or 'PM' for each test case independently.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        day = 'AM'  # Reset day to 'AM' for each test case
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given the original program, the issue with the `day` variable not being reset can lead to incorrect outputs for certain sequences of test cases. Therefore, the original program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
