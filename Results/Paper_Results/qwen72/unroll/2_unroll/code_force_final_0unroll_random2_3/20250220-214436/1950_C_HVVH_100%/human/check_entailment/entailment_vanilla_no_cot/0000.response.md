Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including handling the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00. Here is a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to read each time in 24-hour format.
2. **Time Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it converts to 12:00 AM.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the period to PM.
   - If the hour `h` is 12, it sets the period to PM.
   - For all other hours, it keeps the hour as is and sets the period to AM.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the hour and minute with leading zeros and prints the time followed by the period (AM or PM).

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
