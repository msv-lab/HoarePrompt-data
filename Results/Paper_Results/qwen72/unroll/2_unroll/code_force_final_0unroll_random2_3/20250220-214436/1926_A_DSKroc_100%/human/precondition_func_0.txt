The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where it receives a string of length 5 as input, and the string consists only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function is also expected to be part of a larger program that handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 32. Each test case string is distinct.
