Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, processes each string of length 5, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and prints the most frequent character. The logic is straightforward and handles all edge cases, such as when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (since the problem specifies that the string length is 5, 'A' and 'B' cannot be equal in count). The program also correctly handles the input and output format as described in the problem.
