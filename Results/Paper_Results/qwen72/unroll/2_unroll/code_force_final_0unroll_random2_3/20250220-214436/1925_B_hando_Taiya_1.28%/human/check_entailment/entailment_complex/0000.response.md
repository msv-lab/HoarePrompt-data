### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
     - It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`:
       - If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`:
       - If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that the balance is maximized.
   - The logic for updating `ans` is correct: it ensures that the maximum balance is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly:
     - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the maximum balance is 2, which is correct.
     - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the maximum balance is 1, which is correct.
     - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the maximum balance is 6, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
