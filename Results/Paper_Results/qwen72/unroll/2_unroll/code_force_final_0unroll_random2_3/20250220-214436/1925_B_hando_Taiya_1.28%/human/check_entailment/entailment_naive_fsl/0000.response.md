Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum balance. The function `func_1` iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. However, this approach does not always find the maximum GCD for all possible values of `n` and `x`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 4
```
The correct output should be `2` because the problem of difficulty `10` can be broken into four sub-problems with difficulties `2, 2, 2, 4`, and the GCD of these difficulties is `2`.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it only checks divisors up to the square root of `10` (which are `1` and `2`), and it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is `4`.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum balance, the optimal approach is to divide `x` by `n` and check if the result is an integer. If it is, then the GCD is `x // n`. If not, the maximum GCD can be found by checking the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(x // n if x % n == 0 else gcd(x, n))
```

This version correctly handles all cases and will output the maximum balance for any valid input.
