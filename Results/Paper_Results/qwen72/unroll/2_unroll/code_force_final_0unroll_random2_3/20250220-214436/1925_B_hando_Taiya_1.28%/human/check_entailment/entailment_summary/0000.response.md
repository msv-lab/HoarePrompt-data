### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems such that the GCD is maximized.
   - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`. The program then checks two conditions:
     - If `n <= x // i`, it means we can form `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty of `i` or a multiple of `i`.
     - If `n <= i`, it means we can form `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty of `x // i` or a multiple of `x // i`.
   - The maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies either condition is stored in `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (e.g., `5 5`), where the only possible sub-problems are `1` with GCD `1`.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is a prime number or has few divisors, ensuring that the maximum GCD is found.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` to limit the range of divisors is efficient, as it reduces the number of iterations needed to find the divisors of `x`.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the correct output for the given test cases:
     - For `10 3`, the maximum GCD is `2` (sub-problems could be `4, 2, 4`).
     - For `5 5`, the maximum GCD is `1` (sub-problems could be `1, 1, 1, 1, 1`).
     - For `420 69`, the maximum GCD is `6` (sub-problems could be `6, 6, 6, ..., 6`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of a set of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
