The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `x`, and the function `isqrt(x)`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect the conditions necessary for the loop to start and run at least once.

1. The loop starts with `i` being 1.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1.

Given the constraints:
- `1 <= x <= 10^8`
- `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, which is the largest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= x`.

For the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 1, and `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1. Since `x` is already constrained to be at least 1, `isqrt(x)` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:
- `i` is 1
- `isqrt(x)` is at least 1 (which is always true given the constraints on `x`)

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user input where 1 <= `n` <= `x` and 1 <= `x` <= 10^8, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `isqrt(x)` is at least 1**
