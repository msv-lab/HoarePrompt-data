You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value. The state of `t` is not affected by this function, and `x` and `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum balance. The function `func_1` iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. However, this approach does not always find the maximum GCD for all possible values of `n` and `x`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 4
```
The correct output should be `2` because the problem of difficulty `10` can be broken into four sub-problems with difficulties `2, 2, 2, 4`, and the GCD of these difficulties is `2`.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it only checks divisors up to the square root of `10` (which are `1` and `2`), and it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is `4`.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum balance, the optimal approach is to divide `x` by `n` and check if the result is an integer. If it is, then the GCD is `x // n`. If not, the maximum GCD can be found by checking the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(x // n if x % n == 0 else gcd(x, n))
```

This version correctly handles all cases and will output the maximum balance for any valid input.
