### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a string `s`.

2. **Shuffling the String**: The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a shuffled version of the string `s`. This function returns a new list containing all the elements from `s` in random order, which is then joined back into a string `s2`.

3. **Checking the Condition**: The program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. If they are the same, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` has only one character, it is impossible to generate a different string. The program will always print "No" in this case, which is correct.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will have a very low probability of generating a different string. However, since the problem guarantees that the length of `s` is at most 10, the probability of generating a different string is non-zero, but it might take multiple attempts. The program does not handle this case optimally, but it is not incorrect because it will eventually find a different string with a non-zero probability.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly follows the output format specified in the problem statement. It prints "Yes" or "No" followed by the rearranged string if applicable.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of its logic and output format. However, it might not be the most efficient solution for cases where all characters are the same, but it will still work given the constraints (length of `s` is at most 10).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
