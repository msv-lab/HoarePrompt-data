Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` into subarrays. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

According to the problem description, the optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` is into subarrays `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of:
- `p([1, -1, 1, -1]) = |1 - 1 + 1 - 1| * 4 = 0 * 4 = 0`
- `p([1, -1]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`

So, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
3
```

This is because the program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3` (3 '+' and 3 '-'), and does not consider the optimal splitting of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
