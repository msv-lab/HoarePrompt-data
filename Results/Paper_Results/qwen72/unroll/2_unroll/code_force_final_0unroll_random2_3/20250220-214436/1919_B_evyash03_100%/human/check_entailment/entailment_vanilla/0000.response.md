Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - The string `s` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `expression` and `length` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string.
   - It returns the absolute value of this difference.
   - However, this does not necessarily minimize the total penalty as defined in the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the total penalty, we need to consider how to split the array `a` such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized.
   - The optimal way to split the array is to ensure that each subarray has a sum of zero if possible. This can be achieved by pairing `+` and `-` characters.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is equal, the total penalty can be zero.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the minimum penalty is achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1 for the excess characters.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the array is `[1]`. The penalty is `1` (correct).
   - For the input `-----`, the array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`. The penalty is `5` (correct).
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `0` (correct).
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `4` (correct).
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `4` (correct).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the total penalty as described in the problem.
   - The program simply calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
