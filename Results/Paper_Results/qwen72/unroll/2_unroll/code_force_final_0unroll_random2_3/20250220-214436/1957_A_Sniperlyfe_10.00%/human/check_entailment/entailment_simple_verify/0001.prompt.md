You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer in each inner list is the number of sticks n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the test cases in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears as the first element in the inner lists of `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Calculation**: The function `func_1` then calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. It does this by iterating over the values in the `freq` dictionary and computing `v // 4` for each value `v`. This operation determines how many squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed with the sticks of each length.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue with the program:

- **Polygon Sides**: The program assumes that a regular polygon is always a square (4-sided polygon). This is incorrect because a regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. For example, a triangle (3-sided polygon) can also be formed.

To fix this, the program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for any number of sides greater than or equal to 3, not just 4.

Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, v + 1):
            max_polygons += v // sides
            v %= sides
    return max_polygons
```

In the corrected program:
- We iterate over the possible number of sides for each stick length frequency.
- For each frequency `v`, we calculate how many polygons with `sides` can be formed and update `max_polygons` accordingly.
- We then update `v` to the remainder of `v` divided by `sides` to account for the sticks that are left after forming the polygons.

Given the original program's assumption, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
