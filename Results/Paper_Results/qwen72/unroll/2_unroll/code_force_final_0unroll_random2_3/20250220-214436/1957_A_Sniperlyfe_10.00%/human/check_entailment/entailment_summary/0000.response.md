Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a given set of sticks. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length in the list `arr` and then divides each frequency by 4 to determine the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify that only squares can be formed. Regular polygons can have any number of sides (3 or more), and the program should account for all possible regular polygons.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program's output is based on the assumption that only squares can be formed, which is not aligned with the problem statement. For example, in the third test case, the correct output should be 1 (a square can be formed), but the program would output 0 because it only checks for squares.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program reads the input correctly for the number of test cases and the number of sticks in each test case, but it does not handle the test cases correctly. The function `func_1` should be designed to consider all possible regular polygons with 3 or more sides, not just squares.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
