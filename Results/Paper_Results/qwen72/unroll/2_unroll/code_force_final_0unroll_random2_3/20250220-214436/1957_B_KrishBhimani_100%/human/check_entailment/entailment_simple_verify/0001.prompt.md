You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. These parameters represent the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.

            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop will print a sequence of non-negative integers for each test case. For each test case, if n is 1, it will print k. Otherwise, it will print a sequence of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is the difference between k and the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k` because the sequence must contain exactly one element, and that element must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - The program initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This is done by doubling `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
   - The value `(1 << i) - 1` is appended to the result list `ans`. This value is a number with `i` bits set to 1 (e.g., if `i` is 3, `(1 << 3) - 1` is `7` or `111` in binary).
   - The remaining sum `k - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans` to ensure the total sum is `k`.
   - The program then appends `0` to `ans` until the length of `ans` is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The program ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` is `k` by subtracting the sum of the elements already in `ans` from `k` and appending the result.
  - This is correct because the sum of the elements in `ans` is always `k`.

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
  - The program constructs the first element of `ans` as `(1 << i) - 1`, which is a number with `i` bits set to 1.
  - This is a good strategy because it maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - The remaining elements are either the remaining sum or zeros, which do not affect the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `k` is a power of 2, the program will correctly set the first element to `k - 1` and the second element to 1, ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.
  - If `n` is greater than `k`, the program will append zeros to the sequence, which is valid as long as the sum condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
