### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The input is split and converted to integers, which is appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints `k` directly, which is correct because the sequence must contain exactly one integer, and that integer must be `k`.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - It starts by finding the largest power of 2 less than `k` and adds it to the sequence.
   - The difference between `k` and this power of 2 is then added to the sequence.
   - The remaining `n-2` elements are set to 0.

4. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The largest power of 2 less than `k` ensures that the highest bit set in `k` is used.
   - The difference `k - (1 << i) + 1` ensures that the remaining bits are used to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
   - Setting the remaining elements to 0 is a valid approach because it does not affect the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n > 1`, the function ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sequence for each test case, which is the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Correctness:
