Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to have a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` is set to `n` to shift the indices of the `dp` array so that the prefix sum of 0 is at index `n`.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a` (from 1 to `n`).
   - For each prefix sum `j`, it updates the `new_dp` array to include the counts of possible prefix sums that can be achieved by adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.
   - The `new_dp` array is then used to update the `dp` array for the next iteration.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The result is the value in the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases specified in the problem description. For example:
- It correctly handles the case where `n = 1` and the prefix sum is `0` (returns `0`).
- It correctly handles the case where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and matches the possible outcomes of the prefix sums of an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
