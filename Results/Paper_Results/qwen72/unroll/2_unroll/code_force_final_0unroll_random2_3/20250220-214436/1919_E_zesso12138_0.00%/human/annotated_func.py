    #The program raises a NameError because `final_sum` is not defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a list `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with zeros and an `offset` of `n`. The function then updates the `dp` list through a series of operations based on the elements of `p`. However, the function ultimately raises a `NameError` because the variable `final_sum` is not defined correctly before it is used in the return statement. As a result, the function does not return a value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and p is a list of n integers such that |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of the last processed `n` in the loop, `p` is the list of integers from the last processed segment of `data`, `data` is a list of strings (unchanged), `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each set. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` holds the number of test cases, `n` holds the size of the last processed list, `p` holds the last processed list of integers, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.
