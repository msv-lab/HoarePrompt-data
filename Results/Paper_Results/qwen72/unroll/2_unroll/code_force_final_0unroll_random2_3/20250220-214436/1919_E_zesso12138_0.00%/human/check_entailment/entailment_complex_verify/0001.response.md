### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting only of 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sum array.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is defined as \( p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - `dp` is an array of size `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`.
   - `offset` is used to shift the indices of `dp` to handle negative prefix sums.
   - `dp[offset]` is initialized to 1, representing the base case where the prefix sum is 0 at the start.
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums after adding 1 or -1.
   - The final result is obtained by checking the value of `dp` at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum \( p[-1] + offset \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The `dp` array is correctly initialized and updated.
   - The loop iterates through each element of the array `a`, updating the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (adding 1 or -1).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow and are within the required range.
   - The final sum is calculated correctly by adding the offset to the last element of `p`.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]` as expected.
   - It correctly identifies that there are no valid arrays `a` for the prefix sum array `p = [-1, 1, 2]`.
   - It correctly identifies the valid arrays `a` for the prefix sum array `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Annotated Code Review:

- **Function 1:**
  - The `dp` array is correctly initialized and updated.
  - The `offset` is correctly used to handle negative prefix sums.
  - The loop correctly updates the `dp` array for each possible prefix sum.
  - The final sum calculation is correct: `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`.
  - The return statement correctly returns the value from the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum.

- **Function 2:**
  - The input is correctly read and split.
  - The test cases are correctly processed.
  - The results are correctly stored and printed.

### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- There is no `NameError` as `final_sum` is defined correctly before it is used in the return statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` and outputs the result modulo 998,244,353.

Final: **True**
