Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input and processes it correctly. It splits the input into a list of strings, reads the number of test cases `t`, and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of prefix sums `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - `func_1` uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with a single 1 at the center (offset by `n` to handle negative indices).
   - The loop iterates over each element of `p`, updating the DP array based on the possible transitions (adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum).

3. **State of the Program**:
   - The state of the program before and after function calls is correctly described.
   - The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset` to find the correct index in the DP array.

4. **Error in `func_1`**:
   - There is a comment indicating that the program raises a `NameError` because `final_sum` is not defined. However, `final_sum` is indeed defined in the code as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The error might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the comment. The actual code does define `final_sum` and uses it to return the result from the DP array.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are collected in a list and printed one by one, which matches the expected output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n = 1` and the prefix sum array is `[0]` (which should return 0 because no valid array `a` can produce this prefix sum).
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array is not possible, such as `[-1, 1, 2]` (which should return 0).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its logic and implementation. The only potential issue is the comment about the `NameError`, but the code itself does not have this error.

Correctness: **True**
