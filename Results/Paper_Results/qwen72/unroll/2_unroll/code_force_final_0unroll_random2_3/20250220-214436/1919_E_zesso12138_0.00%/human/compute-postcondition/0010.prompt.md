Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of the last processed `n` in the loop, `p` is the list of integers from the last processed segment of `data`, `data` is a list of strings (unchanged), `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
