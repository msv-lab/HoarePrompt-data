The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable (not adjustable)**
