The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies |p_i| <= n and the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n).

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` is between -n and n. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
