The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a list `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with zeros and an `offset` of `n`. The function then updates the `dp` list through a series of operations based on the elements of `p`. However, the function ultimately raises a `NameError` because the variable `final_sum` is not defined correctly before it is used in the return statement. As a result, the function does not return a value.
