Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. It calculates the number of occurrences of the current median in the array and prints that value, which does not correspond to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The current median is 3. The program will output 1 because the number 3 appears once in the array. However, the correct output should be 2, as you need to increase the third element (which is 3) by 1 twice to make it 5, so the new median becomes 4.

Another example:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
The current median is 1. The program will output 4 because the number 1 appears four times in the array. However, the correct output should be 2, as you need to increase any two elements to make the new median 2.

These examples show that the program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
