Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the count of the median value in the array and prints it, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:

1. Identify the current median of the array.
2. Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the current median to this smallest number.

The provided program does not perform these steps. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the current median, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
