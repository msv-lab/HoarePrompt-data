The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It then sorts the list `a`, calculates the index `p` as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and prints the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final values of `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` correspond to the last test case processed.
