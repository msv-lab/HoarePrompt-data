Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it initializes the `defaultdict`. Specifically, the `default_value` function is not defined, which will cause a `NameError` when the program is run. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of `0` is to use `int` as the default factory.

Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is incorrect. The program should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` (the number of rounds) and calculate the difference accordingly. However, the current logic incorrectly checks if the count is less than or equal to `m` and then adds `m - d[val]` to the answer, which can result in an incorrect count.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected initialization
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1  # Increment the count for each difficulty level
    
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Iterate over all difficulty levels
        if d[val] < m:  # Check if the count is less than the number of rounds
            ans += m - d[val]  # Calculate the additional problems needed
    
    print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program initializes the `defaultdict` correctly.
- It correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.
- The program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Thus, the original program is incorrect, and the corrected version should be used.
