Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description outlines a task for generating files in subdirectories based on the directory name being within a specified range and containing HTML files. However, the program provided is for a different task, which involves reading input values and determining if certain conditions are met to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The program does not contain the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` or any logic related to file or directory manipulation as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
