The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the range [start, end]. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are digits within the specified range [start, end].

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current working directory that are digits within the range [start, end], where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.**
