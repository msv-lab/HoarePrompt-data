The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of the current working directory and the variables `start` and `end` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the range [start, end], `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
