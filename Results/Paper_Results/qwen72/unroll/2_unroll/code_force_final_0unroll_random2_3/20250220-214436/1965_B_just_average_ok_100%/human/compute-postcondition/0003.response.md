Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. For each test case, the function modifies a list of powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^20) by removing the element 2^idx (where idx is the largest index such that 2^idx <= k) and appending the elements (k - 2^idx), (k + 1), and (k + 2^idx + 1). The function then prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the modified list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
