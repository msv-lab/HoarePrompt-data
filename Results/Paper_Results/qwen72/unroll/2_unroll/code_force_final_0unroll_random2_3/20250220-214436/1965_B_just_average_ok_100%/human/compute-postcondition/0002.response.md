The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it appears that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `k`. Additionally, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, indicated by the parameter `t`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
