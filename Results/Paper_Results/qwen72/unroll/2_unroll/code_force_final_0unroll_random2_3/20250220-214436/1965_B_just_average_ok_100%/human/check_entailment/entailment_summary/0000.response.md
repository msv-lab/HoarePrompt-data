Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Starting with a list of the first 21 powers of 2 (`1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20`).
2. Identifying the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removing it from the list.
3. Adding three new elements to the list: `(k - 2^idx)`, `(k + 1)`, and `(k + 2^idx + 1)`.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

### 1. No Subsequence with Sum `k`
- The program removes the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` from the list. This ensures that the sum of the remaining elements cannot be exactly `k` because the removed element is crucial for forming the sum `k` using the powers of 2.
- The new elements `(k - 2^idx)`, `(k + 1)`, and `(k + 2^idx + 1)` are added to the list. These elements are chosen such that they do not contribute to forming a subsequence that sums to `k`:
  - `(k - 2^idx)` is less than `k` and cannot be combined with the remaining elements to form `k` because the removed `2^idx` is necessary.
  - `(k + 1)` is greater than `k` and cannot be combined with the remaining elements to form `k` without exceeding it.
  - `(k + 2^idx + 1)` is also greater than `k` and cannot be combined with the remaining elements to form `k` without exceeding it.

### 2. All Other Sums `1 ≤ v ≤ n` (where `v ≠ k`)
- The list of powers of 2 from `1` to `2^20` can represent any integer from `1` to `2^21 - 1` (which is greater than `10^6`).
- By removing `2^idx` and adding `(k - 2^idx)`, `(k + 1)`, and `(k + 2^idx + 1)`, the program ensures that all sums `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k` can still be formed:
  - The sums that were previously formed using `2^idx` can now be formed using `(k - 2^idx)` and the remaining elements.
  - The sums that were not affected by the removal of `2^idx` can still be formed using the remaining elements.
  - The new elements `(k + 1)` and `(k + 2^idx + 1)` help in forming sums that were previously not possible due to the removal of `2^idx`.

### 3. Size of the Sequence
- The initial list of powers of 2 has 21 elements.
- The program removes one element and adds three new elements, resulting in a list of 23 elements.
- Since 23 is within the limit of 25, the size constraint is satisfied.

### 4. Validity of the Solution
- The program ensures that the sequence `a` meets the problem's requirements for all test cases.
- The execution summary confirms that the function processes the input correctly and produces the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
