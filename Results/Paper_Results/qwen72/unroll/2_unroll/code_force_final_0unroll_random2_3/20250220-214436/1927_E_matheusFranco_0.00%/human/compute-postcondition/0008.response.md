To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `permutation` list step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
2. `permutation` is a list where the first `k` positions are filled with the integers from 1 to `k` in a specific pattern.
3. The pattern for filling the first `k` positions is: each integer `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`) is placed at positions that are multiples of its index (0-based) plus the index itself.
4. The rest of the list remains zeros.
5. `idx` is 0.
6. `idx_v` is 1.
7. `curr_v` is `k + 1`.
8. `result` is a string representation of the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Construction of `permutation`:
1. **Initialization**: The `permutation` list is initialized with `n` elements, all set to zero.
2. **Filling the first `k` positions**:
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `k`:
     - The integer `i` is placed at positions that are multiples of its index (0-based) plus the index itself.
     - For example, if `i` is 1 (index 0), it will be placed at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
     - If `i` is 2 (index 1), it will be placed at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
     - If `i` is 3 (index 2), it will be placed at positions 2, 5, 8, 11, ...

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `k = 3` for a concrete example.

- `permutation` is initially `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- For `i = 1` (index 0):
  - Place 1 at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  - `permutation` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- For `i = 2` (index 1):
  - Place 2 at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
  - `permutation` becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.
- For `i = 3` (index 2):
  - Place 3 at positions 2, 5, 8.
  - `permutation` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2]`.

### Final `permutation` List:
The final `permutation` list will have the first `k` positions filled according to the pattern described, and the rest of the list will remain zeros if `n > k`.

### String Representation:
The `result` is a string representation of the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.

### Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string representation of the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 2 1 3 1 2 3 2 (where the permutation list is filled with the integers from 1 to k in the specified pattern and the rest of the list remains zeros if n > k)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the construction pattern of the `permutation` list.
