Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It then generates a permutation list of length `n` where the first `k` positions are filled with integers from 1 to `k` in a pattern such that each integer `i` (1-based) is placed at positions that are multiples of `i-1` (0-based) plus `i-1`. The remaining positions in the list, if any, are filled with zeros. The function prints this permutation list as a space-separated string and does not return any value. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
