Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `permutation` is a list where the first `k` positions are filled with the integers from 1 to `k` in a pattern where each integer is placed at positions that are multiples of its index (0-based) plus the index itself, and the rest of the list remains zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k + 1`, `result` is a string representation of the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` converts each element in the `permutation` list to a string and joins them with a space.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `result` is a string that represents the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.
