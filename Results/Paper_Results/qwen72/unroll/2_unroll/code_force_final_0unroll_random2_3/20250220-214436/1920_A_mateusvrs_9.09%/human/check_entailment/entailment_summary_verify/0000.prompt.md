You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers for each test case. A valid integer is one that lies between the maximum of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum of type 2 constraints (`ax`), excluding any type 3 constraints (`cx`). The function then prints these results, one per test case, each on a new line. The final state of the program is that `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers for the corresponding test case, and `r` has a length equal to `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints as described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by:

1. Reading the number of constraints.
2. Initializing variables `ax` and `bx` to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`, respectively.
3. Collecting all the constraints of type 3 (where `k` must not equal a specific value) in a set `cx`.
4. Updating the bounds `ax` and `bx` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2.
5. Checking if the lower bound `bx` is greater than or equal to the upper bound `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list, indicating no valid `k` exists.
6. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values (from the set `cx`) that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the bounds are invalid (i.e., `bx >= ax`), and it correctly accounts for the constraints of type 3 by excluding them from the valid range. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
