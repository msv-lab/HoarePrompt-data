The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need to be adjusted as it will be set by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, to clearly state the conditions under which the loop will execute, we can restate the initial conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is set by the loop**
