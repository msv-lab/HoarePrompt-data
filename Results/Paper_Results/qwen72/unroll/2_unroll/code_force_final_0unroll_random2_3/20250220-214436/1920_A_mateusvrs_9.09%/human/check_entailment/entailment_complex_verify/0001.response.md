### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `r` to store the results, `cx` to store the values of `x` for type 3 constraints, `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`).
   - The choice of `1000000000 + 7` for `ax` and `-1` for `bx` is appropriate to ensure that the initial values are outside the possible range of `x` values, which are between 1 and \(10^9\).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program correctly updates `bx` for type 1 constraints (`k >= x`) and `ax` for type 2 constraints (`k <= x`).
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the program correctly adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - This check is necessary and correctly implemented.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` to count the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value `i` that is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line, which is the correct output format.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization of `ax` and `bx`**:
  - The initial values of `ax` and `bx` are correctly chosen to ensure they are outside the possible range of `x` values. This ensures that the initial constraints are not violated.

- **Constraint Processing**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` and `ax` for type 1 and type 2 constraints, respectively.
  - The use of a set `cx` for type 3 constraints is appropriate because it ensures that each value is unique and allows for efficient checking of whether a value is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

- **Range Validation**:
  - The check `if bx >= ax` is necessary and correctly implemented. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both constraints, and the program correctly appends `0` to the result list.

- **Counting Excluded Values**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range.
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is mathematically sound and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and input format. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
