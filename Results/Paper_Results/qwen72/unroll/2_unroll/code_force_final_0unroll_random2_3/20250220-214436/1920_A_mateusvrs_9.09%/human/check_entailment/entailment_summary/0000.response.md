Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - It checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy `k >= bx` and `k <= ax` if `bx >= ax`.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and then subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results, one per test case, each on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `bx` and `ax` are the same, correctly returning `0` if `bx >= ax`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints within the valid range.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that checking for the presence of an integer in `cx` is efficient (O(1) on average).

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the function `func` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It processes the constraints as described and outputs the correct results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
