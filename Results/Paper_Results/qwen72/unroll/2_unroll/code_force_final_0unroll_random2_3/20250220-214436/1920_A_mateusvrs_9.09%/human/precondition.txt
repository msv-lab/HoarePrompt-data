t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.
