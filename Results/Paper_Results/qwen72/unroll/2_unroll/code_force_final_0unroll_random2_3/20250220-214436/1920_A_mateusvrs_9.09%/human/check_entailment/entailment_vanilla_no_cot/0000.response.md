Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints, and calculates the number of integers that satisfy all constraints within each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads `n` lines of constraints.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the maximum possible value for `k` (type 2 constraint).
   - It initializes `bx` to -1 to represent the minimum possible value for `k` (type 1 constraint).
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to (type 3 constraints).

3. **Updating Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and the constraint value `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and the constraint value `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`a == 3`), it adds the constraint value `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and then subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range. This gives the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is accurate for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
