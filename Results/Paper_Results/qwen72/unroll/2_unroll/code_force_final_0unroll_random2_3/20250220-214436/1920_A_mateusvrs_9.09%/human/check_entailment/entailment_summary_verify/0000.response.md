### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k`.
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound of `k`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not equal.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads `a` and `x`.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Bounds:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx >= ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid integer `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

5. **Calculating Valid Integers:**
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` by subtracting the number of invalid values (from the set `cx`) that fall within this range from the total number of integers in the range.
   - It appends this result to the list `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results in `r`, one per line.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Bounds:**
  - The function correctly initializes `ax` and `bx` to represent the upper and lower bounds.
  - It updates `bx` and `ax` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, ensuring that `bx` is the maximum lower bound and `ax` is the minimum upper bound.

- **Handling Type 3 Constraints:**
  - The function correctly collects all type 3 constraints in the set `cx`.
  - It then excludes these values from the valid range `[bx, ax]` by iterating through `cx` and checking if each value falls within the range.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where `bx >= ax`, indicating no valid `k` exists.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the range `[bx, ax]` is valid and calculates the number of valid integers by subtracting the invalid values.

- **Output:**
  - The function prints the results for each test case, one per line, as required.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
