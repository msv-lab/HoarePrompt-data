The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. The constraints are pairs (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer. The function must handle these constraints according to the rules specified.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each with a number of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on the constraints, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
