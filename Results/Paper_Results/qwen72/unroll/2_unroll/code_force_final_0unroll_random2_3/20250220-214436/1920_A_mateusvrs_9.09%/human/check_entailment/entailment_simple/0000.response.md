### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - The program initializes `bx` to the smallest possible value and `ax` to the largest possible value.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid integer `k` that can satisfy all constraints, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy the constraints. This is done by:
     - Calculating the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, which is `ax - bx + 1`.
     - Subtracting the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Constraints: `1 3`, `2 10`, `3 1`, `3 5`
  - `bx` is updated to 3 (from `1 3`).
  - `ax` is updated to 10 (from `2 10`).
  - `cx` contains 1 and 5.
  - Valid integers are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
  - Result: 7 (Correct).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 4`
  - `bx` is updated to 5 (from `1 5`).
  - `ax` is updated to 4 (from `2 4`).
  - No valid integers satisfy `5 <= k <= 4`.
  - Result: 0 (Correct).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Constraints: `3 6`, `3 7`, `1 2`, `1 7`, `3 100`, `3 44`, `2 100`, `2 98`, `1 3`, `3 99`
  - `bx` is updated to 7 (from `1 7`).
  - `ax` is updated to 98 (from `2 98`).
  - `cx` contains 6, 7, 100, 44, 99.
  - Valid integers are 8, 9, 10, ..., 98.
  - Result: 90 (Correct).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 10`, `1 9`, `2 2`, `3 2`, `3 9`
  - `bx` is updated to 9 (from `1 9`).
  - `ax` is updated to 2 (from `2 2`).
  - No valid integers satisfy `9 <= k <= 2`.
  - Result: 0 (Correct).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Constraints: `1 1`, `2 2`, `3 1`, `3 2`, `3 3`
  - `bx` is updated to 1 (from `1 1`).
  - `ax` is updated to 2 (from `2 2`).
  - `cx` contains 1, 2, 3.
  - No valid integers satisfy `1 <= k <= 2` and `k != 1` and `k != 2`.
  - Result: 0 (Correct).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Constraints: `1 10000`, `2 900000000`, `3 500000000`, `1 100000000`, `3 10000`, `3 900000001`
  - `bx` is updated to 100000000 (from `1 100000000`).
  - `ax` is updated to 900000000 (from `2 900000000`).
  - `cx` contains 500000000, 10000, 900000001.
  - Valid integers are 100000000, 100000001, ..., 900000000.
  - Result: 800000000 (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
