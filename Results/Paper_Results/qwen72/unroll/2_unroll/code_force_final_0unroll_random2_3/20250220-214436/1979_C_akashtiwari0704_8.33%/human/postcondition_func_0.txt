The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). For each test case, the function calculates a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If such a distribution is possible, the function prints the list of bets. If no such distribution exists, the function prints -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
