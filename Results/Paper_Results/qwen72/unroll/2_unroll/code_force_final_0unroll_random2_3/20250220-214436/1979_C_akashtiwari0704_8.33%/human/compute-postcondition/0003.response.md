The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function returns a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If no such distribution of bets exists, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a test case with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. It returns a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If no such distribution exists, it returns -1.**
