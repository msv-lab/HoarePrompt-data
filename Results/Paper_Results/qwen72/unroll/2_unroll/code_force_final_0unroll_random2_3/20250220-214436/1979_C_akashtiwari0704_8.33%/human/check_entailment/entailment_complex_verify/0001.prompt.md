You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should return a list of n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If no such distribution exists, the function should return -1.

    #State: The function `func` processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints a list of integers representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution exists. The variables `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` are updated and used within the loop, but their final values after the loop will depend on the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). For each test case, the function calculates a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If such a distribution is possible, the function prints the list of bets. If no such distribution exists, the function prints -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, the sum of all bets `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than `k_i * x_i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and calculates the total sum of these bets `sumo`.
   - If the total sum `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The product of all multipliers `prod` is used to ensure that each bet `a[i]` is a multiple of the other multipliers. This is a common approach to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is less than the product.
   - However, the condition `if sumo >= prod` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if sumo >= prod // a[i]` for each `i`, but the program checks `sumo >= prod` which is not the correct comparison.
   - The program should check if the total sum of bets `sumo` is less than the amount received back for each outcome `k_i * x_i`.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - Instead of checking `if sumo >= prod`, we should check if `sumo < prod // a[i]` for each `i`.
   - If this condition holds for all `i`, then the solution is valid. Otherwise, we should print `-1`.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first test case with `k = [3, 2, 7]`:
     - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
     - Bets: `a = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
     - `sumo = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
     - `41 < 42 // 3 = 14` (False)
     - `41 < 42 // 2 = 21` (False)
     - `41 < 42 // 7 = 6` (False)
     - The program incorrectly prints `27 41 12` instead of checking the correct condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly check the condition that the total sum of bets must be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The logic for determining the bets and checking the condition is flawed.
