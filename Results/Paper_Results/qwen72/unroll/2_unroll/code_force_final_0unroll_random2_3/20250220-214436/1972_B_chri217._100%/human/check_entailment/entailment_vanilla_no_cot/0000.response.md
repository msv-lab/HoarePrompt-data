Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, storing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins. It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` and counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - The game logic is based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the last move. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` returns "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd and "NO" if it is even. This matches the expected output format.

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and applies the correct logic to determine the winner. Therefore, the program is correct.
