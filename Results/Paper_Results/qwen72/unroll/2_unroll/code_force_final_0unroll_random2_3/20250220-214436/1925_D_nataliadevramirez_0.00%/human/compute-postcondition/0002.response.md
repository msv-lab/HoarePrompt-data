Output State: **The variable `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are updated based on user input, and the result of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is printed. After all iterations, `t` remains the same as the initial state, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are not retained and are re-assigned in each iteration.**
