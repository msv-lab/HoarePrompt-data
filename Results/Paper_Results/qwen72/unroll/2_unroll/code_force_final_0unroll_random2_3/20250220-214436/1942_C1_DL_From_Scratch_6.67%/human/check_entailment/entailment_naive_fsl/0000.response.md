Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of forming triangles using the vertices that wrap around the polygon. The logic in the program only considers the gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list and does not account for the wrap-around case where the last vertex and the first vertex could form a triangle with an additional vertex.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
8 4 0
1 2 5 6
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `4`. The program only counts the triangles formed by the gaps between consecutive vertices, but it misses the triangles that can be formed by considering the wrap-around from the last vertex to the first vertex. The correct triangles in this case are (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7), and (6, 7, 8).
