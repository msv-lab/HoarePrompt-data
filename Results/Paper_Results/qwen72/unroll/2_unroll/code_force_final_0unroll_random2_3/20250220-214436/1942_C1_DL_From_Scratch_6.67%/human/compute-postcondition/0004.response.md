Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0 and not used), and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function then calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted list of integers, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers remain unchanged, but their values are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop. **
