Output State: **The loop will print the length of the list `ans` and the elements of the list `ans` for each test case. The list `ans` will contain the values `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << i`. The value of `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.**
