### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The program then determines the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by finding the highest bit set in `k`.
   - It constructs a sequence `ans` that includes:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k + 1 + (1 << i)` can be formed.
     - All powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i` (which is `1 << i`).

3. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`:
     - `k - (1 << i)` is included to prevent `k` from being formed.
     - The powers of 2 are included to ensure that all other sums can be formed.
   - The sequence `ans` is of size at most 25 because it includes at most 20 powers of 2, plus 3 additional elements.
   - The sequence `ans` can form all sums from `1` to `n` except `k`:
     - By including all powers of 2 except `2^i`, we can form any sum that is a combination of these powers.
     - The additional elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensure that sums around `k` can be formed, but not `k` itself.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is a power of 2 by excluding that specific power of 2 from the sequence.
   - The program ensures that the sequence can form all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` by including a wide range of powers of 2 and additional elements.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient and runs within the constraints provided.
   - The loop to find the highest bit set in `k` runs in constant time.
   - The loop to append powers of 2 runs in a fixed number of iterations (20).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from `1` to `n` to be formed.

Correctness: **True**
