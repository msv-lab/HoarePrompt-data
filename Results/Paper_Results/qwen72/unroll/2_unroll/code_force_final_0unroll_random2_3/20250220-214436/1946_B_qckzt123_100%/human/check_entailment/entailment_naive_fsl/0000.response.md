Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the array is negative and the maximum subarray sum is also negative. In such cases, the program incorrectly adds a positive value to the answer, which can lead to incorrect results. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
The sum of the array `s` is `-6`, and the maximum subarray sum `t` is `0`. According to the problem, the maximum possible sum after 2 operations should be `-6` (since adding the sum of any subarray, including the empty subarray, will not increase the sum). However, the program will output `999999994` (which is `-6 + 0 + 0` modulo `10^9 + 7`), which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-6` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is `999999994`. But the logic in the program does not correctly handle this edge case.
