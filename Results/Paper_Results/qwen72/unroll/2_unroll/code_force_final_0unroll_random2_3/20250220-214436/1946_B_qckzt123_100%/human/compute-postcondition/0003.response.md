Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the final output state is that `T` is the initial integer value read from the standard input, `t` is the initial number of test cases, `n` and `k` are the last values read for the final test case, `a` is the last list of integers read for the final test case, and `ans` is the final computed answer for the last test case. The variables `s`, `tmp`, and `t` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.**
