### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is unusual but not incorrect since it reads input directly from `sys.stdin`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the function calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.
   - This is correct as the sum of the array is a necessary part of the problem.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` that does not drop below zero. This is done using a simple loop where `tmp` keeps a running sum of the subarray.
   - If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero, which ensures that only non-negative subarray sums are considered.
   - This is correct because the problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the maximum subarray sum that does not drop below zero is a key part of this calculation.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - This ensures that the sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` and is non-negative.
   - This is correct as it follows the problem's requirement for the sum modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Applying Operations:**
   - The function then applies `k-1` operations to the initial answer `ans`.
   - In each operation, `t` is doubled and taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The doubled value of `t` is added to `ans`, and `ans` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This is correct because each operation can double the maximum subarray sum and add it to the current sum of the array, which aligns with the problem's description.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` for each test case is printed to the standard output.
   - This is correct as the problem requires printing the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly processes the input, calculates the necessary values, applies the operations as described, and outputs the correct results. The logic and implementation align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
