Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of length `n` and an integer `k` from the standard input. It computes a value `ans` based on the sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum that does not drop below zero, then applies `k` operations to this value. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and their results printed. **
