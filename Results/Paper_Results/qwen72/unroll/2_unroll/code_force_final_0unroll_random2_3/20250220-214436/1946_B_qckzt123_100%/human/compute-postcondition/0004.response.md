The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array and the number of operations (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the result of some operations performed on the array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an array `a` of length `n` and `k` operations. The function returns the result of the operations for each test case.**
