Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads three lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000), the second line contains a list of `n` integers `lista_A` (where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains a list of `n` integers `lista_B` (where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9). It then reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. The function calculates a value `resultado` which is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` in the range from `n-k` to `n-1`, where `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_A` from index `0` to `n-k-1` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, and `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `k` to `n-1`. Finally, the function prints `resultado`. The function does not return any value. **
