The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie'. The function does not modify the input parameters or return any values. After the function concludes, the input variables remain unchanged, and the counts for each test case are printed to the console.
