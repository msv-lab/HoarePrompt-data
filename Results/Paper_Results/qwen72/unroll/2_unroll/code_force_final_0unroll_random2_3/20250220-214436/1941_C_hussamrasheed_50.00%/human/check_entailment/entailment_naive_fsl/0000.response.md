Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it only counts and removes the exact substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by removing characters to break these substrings.

For example, consider the input string "mappie". The program will count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", and output 2. However, the correct output should be 1, because removing the 'p' between "map" and "pie" would make the string "maie", which is beautiful.

Another example is the string "mpie". The program will output 1 because it counts "pie" and removes it, but the correct output should be 0, as the string is already beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
