### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` by buying up to `k` additional cards.
   - Each subarray of length `n` must contain exactly one of each card type from 1 to `n`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The key is to ensure that the minimum number of any type of card is as close to `n` as possible, because this will allow us to form more permutations.
   - The program sorts the array `a` to facilitate the process of balancing the counts of cards.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Sort the Array:** The array `a` is sorted to facilitate the process of balancing the counts of cards.
   - **Balance the Counts:** We iterate through the sorted array and try to balance the counts of the cards by using the available `k` coins.
   - **Calculate the Result:**
     - If the difference between the counts of the current card and the next card is greater than the available `k` coins, we stop and calculate the result.
     - Otherwise, we continue to balance the counts by using the coins.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count of cards (`a[0]`).
     - `rem` is the remainder of the coins after the last balancing step.
     - `y` is the number of cards that are already balanced and do not need further adjustment.
   - **Balancing Loop:**
     - For each card type from 1 to `n-1`, we check if the difference between the current count and the next count exceeds the available `k` coins.
     - If it does, we calculate the new count `r` and the remainder `rem`, and break out of the loop.
     - If it doesn't, we use the coins to balance the counts and update `k`.
   - **Final Calculation:**
     - If `k` is not zero after the loop, we use the remaining coins to increase the count of the last card type.
     - The final score is calculated as `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero after the loop.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is non-zero and can be used to further increase the count of the last card type.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
   - The balancing loop takes \(O(n)\) time.
   - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Verification:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function processes multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins.
  - The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.

- **Program Analysis:**
  - The program correctly sorts the array `a` to facilitate the balancing of card counts.
  - The loop iterates through the sorted array and attempts to balance the counts of cards by using the available `k` coins.
  - The program correctly calculates the new count `r` and the remainder `rem` when the available `k` coins are insufficient to balance the next card count.
  - The final score is calculated correctly as `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.
