The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins available to buy new cards.
  - `a`: a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type initially available.

The function returns the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k` for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` representing the initial number of cards of each type. It returns the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins for each test case.**
