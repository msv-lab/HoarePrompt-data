Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the handling of the "NO" cases. Specifically, the program prints 'No' instead of 'NO' (capitalization matters according to the problem description). This will cause the output to be incorrect for test cases where the string length is 1 or all characters in the string are the same.

For example, when the input is:
```
2
d
xxxx
```
The program will output:
```
No
No
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
NO
NO
```
