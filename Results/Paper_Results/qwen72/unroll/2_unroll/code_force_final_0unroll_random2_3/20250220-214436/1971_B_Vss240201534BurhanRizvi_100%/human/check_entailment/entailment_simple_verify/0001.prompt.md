You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to take a string `s` as input, where `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user. For each iteration, the user will input a string `s`. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in the string are the same (and the length is greater than 1), the loop will print 'No'. Otherwise, it will print 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of the string `s` (or a modified version if the shuffled string happens to be the same as the original). The variable `s` will be updated with each new input string in each iteration, but will not retain any value after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` using `input()`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `s` is 1, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.
   - This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **All Characters are the Same:**
   - If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1, it prints 'No' because all characters are the same, and any rearrangement will result in the same string.
   - This is also correct as per the problem statement.

4. **General Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program attempts to rearrange the string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a new string `s2`.
   - It checks if `s2` is equal to `s`. If they are equal, it manually rearranges `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - This ensures that `s2` is different from `s` in the general case where `s` has at least two different characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Analysis:
- **Single Character String:** Correctly handled by printing 'No'.
- **All Characters are the Same:** Correctly handled by printing 'No'.
- **General Case:** The use of `random.sample` is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string. However, the check `if s == s2` and the manual rearrangement `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` ensures that the generated string is different from the original string `s`. This is a robust solution because:
  - If the random permutation is different, it is used directly.
  - If the random permutation is the same, the manual rearrangement guarantees a different string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output string is different from the input string when possible and reports 'No' when it is not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
