The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1. Then, for each element from `row[d-1]` to `row[len(row)-1]`, it updates the element to be the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (including the incremented first `d-1` elements) plus the current value plus 1. Finally, the function returns the last element of the updated `row` list.
