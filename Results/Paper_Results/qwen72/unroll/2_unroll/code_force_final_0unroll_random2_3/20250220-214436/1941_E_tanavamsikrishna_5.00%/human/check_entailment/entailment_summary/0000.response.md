### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a grid representing a river, where the goal is to build bridges on `k` consecutive rows with the minimum total cost.
   - Each row has a specific depth for each cell, and the cost of installing a support in a cell is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed at the first and last columns of each row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which ensures that the first support is installed at the first column.
   - For each subsequent element, it updates the cost to be the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus the current depth plus 1. This ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a test case, including the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these total costs.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and parsed.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation for each row in `func_1` is correct, as it ensures the first and last supports are installed and the distance constraint is met.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost for `k` consecutive rows is correctly computed and the minimum is printed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
