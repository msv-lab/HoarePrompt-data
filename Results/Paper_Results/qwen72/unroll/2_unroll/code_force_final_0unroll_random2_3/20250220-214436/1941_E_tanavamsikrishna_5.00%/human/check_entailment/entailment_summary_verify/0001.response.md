### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a grid representing a river with `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - Each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i, j}`.
   - Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of the chosen row.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to each cell's depth.
   - For the remaining cells, it calculates the cost by adding 1 to the cell's depth and the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

   **Analysis:**
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d-1` cells with the cost `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - For the remaining cells, the function uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells, which ensures that the distance constraint `d` is respected.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total cost of installing supports for the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths for `n` rows.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these total costs.

   **Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.
   - It iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

   **Analysis:**
   - The input handling is correct and follows the problem's constraints.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, such as the number of rows and columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance.
   - The function ensures that supports are installed in the first and last columns of each row.
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

6. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The algorithm used in `func_1` is a dynamic programming approach that ensures the minimum cost for installing supports while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, respects the constraints, and uses an appropriate dynamic programming approach to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

**Final: True**
