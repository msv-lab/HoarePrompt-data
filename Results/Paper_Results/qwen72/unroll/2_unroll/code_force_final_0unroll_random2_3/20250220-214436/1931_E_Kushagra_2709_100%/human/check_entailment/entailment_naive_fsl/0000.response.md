Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players, but it seems to be focusing on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, which is not directly related to the game's rules.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse either 14 (becoming 41) or 2 (remaining 2). If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to form 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\), so Sasha wins. If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is also greater than \(10^2 = 100\), so Sasha wins again. However, the provided program does not correctly simulate this logic.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual moves that Anna and Sasha can make. It instead relies on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
