### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The input is handled correctly, reading the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums` using `sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))`. This is correct because it converts each integer to a string and sums the lengths of these strings.
   - The function then calculates the number of trailing zeros for each integer in `nums` using the `zerocnts` function and sorts these counts in descending order.
   - The loop `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):` iterates over the sorted list of trailing zero counts, starting from the first element and taking every second element. This is intended to simulate Sasha's optimal play, where he would concatenate the largest possible numbers to maximize the total number of digits.
   - The total number of digits `tot` is reduced by the number of trailing zeros at even indices. This is based on the assumption that trailing zeros do not contribute to the length of the concatenated number when Sasha makes his move.
   - Finally, the function checks if the reduced total number of digits `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer by converting it to a string and iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is encountered.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros, which is used in `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Anna's move of reversing the digits of an integer does not change the total number of digits in the list.
  - Sasha's move of concatenating two integers reduces the number of elements in the list but increases the total number of digits.
  - The key to determining the winner is the total number of digits after all possible moves. If the total number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins because he can create a number that is at least `10^m`.
  - The reduction of `tot` by the number of trailing zeros at even indices is a heuristic to simulate the effect of Sasha's optimal play. However, this heuristic might not always be correct, especially if the trailing zeros are significant in the context of the game.

### Potential Issues:
- **Trailing Zeros Heuristic:**
  - The heuristic of reducing `tot` by the number of trailing zeros at even indices might not accurately simulate Sasha's optimal play. Trailing zeros can be significant in the context of concatenation, and removing them might not reflect the actual game dynamics.
  - For example, if `nums` contains a large number with many trailing zeros, removing these zeros might undercount the total number of digits, leading to an incorrect determination of the winner.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is flawed due to the heuristic used to reduce the total number of digits. This heuristic does not accurately simulate the game dynamics, especially when trailing zeros are significant.
