### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` of `k` integers.
   - Finally, it reads the list of `q` integers `b`.

2. **Function Call and Output:**
   - For each value in `b`, the program calls the function `func_1` with the first element of `a` and the current value of `b`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the number of winners for a given initial number of players `b` and the sequence `a`.

3. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` (an integer) and `b` (an integer).
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, it returns `a - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `b`.

4. **Issues with the Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem.
   - The function should take the entire sequence `a` and the number of players `b` as inputs, not just the first element of `a`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It should simulate the rounds of the game and count the remaining players after all rounds.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The function should simulate the rounds of the game by repeatedly removing the players at the positions specified in `a` until no more players can be removed.
   - The number of remaining players after the simulation is the number of winners.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of winners in the game. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and does not simulate the rounds of the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.
