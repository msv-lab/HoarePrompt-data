Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is overly simplistic and does not account for the iterative process of removing players based on the sequence `a` and the number of players `n_i`. The function should simulate the rounds of the game, removing the specified players in each round until no more players can be removed, and then count the remaining players to determine the winners.

Here is a more accurate implementation of the game logic:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        removed = False
        for position in a:
            if position <= len(players):
                players.pop(position - 1)
                removed = True
        if not removed:
            break
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for n_i in n_values:
        print(simulate_game(a, n_i), end=' ')
    print()
```

This implementation correctly simulates the game by:
1. Initializing a list of players.
2. Iteratively removing players at the specified positions.
3. Stopping the game when no more players can be removed.
4. Counting the remaining players to determine the number of winners.

The original program's `func_1` function does not perform these steps and thus is incorrect.
