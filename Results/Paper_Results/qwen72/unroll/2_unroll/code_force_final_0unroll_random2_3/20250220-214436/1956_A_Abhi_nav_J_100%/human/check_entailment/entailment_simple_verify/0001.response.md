### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` of length `k` and the list of `q` values `n_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to determine the number of winners when `b` players start the game and the sequence `a` is used to kick out players.
   - The function checks if `a` (the first element of the sequence) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of players).
   - If `a <= b`, it returns `a - 1`.
   - If `a > b`, it returns `b`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the game rules described in the problem.
   - According to the problem, in each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are kicked out, and this process continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not account for the entire sequence `a` or the rounds of the game.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the example given in the problem with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`:
     - The correct output should be `2` (players A and B win).
     - However, `func_1(3, 5)` returns `2`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but does not generalize to other cases.
   - For `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 6`:
     - The correct output should be `1` (players A, B, and D win).
     - However, `func_1(3, 6)` returns `2`, which is incorrect.
   - For `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 7`:
     - The correct output should be `2` (players A, B, and F win).
     - However, `func_1(3, 7)` returns `2`, which is incorrect.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly state that the function `func_1` is called with the first element of `a` and each element of `q_wali_list`.
   - The annotations also correctly point out that the function `func_1` returns an integer, but the logic inside the function is flawed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game rules.
   - It only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not handle the rounds or the entire sequence `a`.
   - The function's logic is incorrect and does not match the problem description.
