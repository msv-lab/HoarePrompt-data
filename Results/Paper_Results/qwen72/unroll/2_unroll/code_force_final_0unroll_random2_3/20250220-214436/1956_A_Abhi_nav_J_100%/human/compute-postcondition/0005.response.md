Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` integers where `1 ≤ k ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100`, and `b` is a list of `q` integers where `1 ≤ q ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100`. The function returns the list `b` if `a` is not less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function attempts to return `a - 1`, which will result in a runtime error because the operation is not valid for a list. **
