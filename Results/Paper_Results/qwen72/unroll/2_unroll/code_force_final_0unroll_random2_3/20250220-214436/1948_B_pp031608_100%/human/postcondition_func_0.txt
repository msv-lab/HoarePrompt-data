The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads `n` lines of input, where `n` is an integer provided by the user. Each line contains an integer `m` followed by a list of `m` integers. For each list, the function checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. If it can, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to any external variables `t` and `a` that might have been present before the function call.
