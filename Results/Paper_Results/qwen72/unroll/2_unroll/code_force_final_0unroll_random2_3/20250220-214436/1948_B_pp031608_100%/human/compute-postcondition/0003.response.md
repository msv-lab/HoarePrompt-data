The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= 99.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. However, based on the given parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes the list `a` in some way, possibly performing operations that depend on `t` and `n`.

Since the output is not explicitly defined, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^3), `n` (an integer between 2 and 50), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined.**
