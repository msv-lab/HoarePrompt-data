### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order using `a.sort()` followed by `a.reverse()`. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the array, which is useful for Alice's strategy to remove the smallest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove, from 0 to `k`.
   - For each possible number of removed elements `i`:
     - If `i` is 0, Bob will multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1. The sum after Bob's operation is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and appended to the list `ans`.
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the program updates the sum by adding the element Alice just removed and subtracting twice the element Bob will multiply by -1. This is done to account for the changes in the array after Alice's removal and Bob's multiplication.
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, the program simply adds the element Alice just removed to the sum, as Bob cannot multiply any more elements by -1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value from the list `ans`, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Analysis:
- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. By sorting the array in descending order, the smallest elements are at the end, and the program correctly considers removing up to `k` elements.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The program correctly calculates the effect of Bob's moves by considering the smallest `x` elements after Alice's removals.
- **Combination of Strategies**: The program iterates over all possible combinations of Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications, ensuring that it finds the optimal sum for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `k` or `x` are 0 or equal to `n` correctly.
- **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it sorts the array once and then performs a linear scan over the possible removals.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and handles the input and output as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
