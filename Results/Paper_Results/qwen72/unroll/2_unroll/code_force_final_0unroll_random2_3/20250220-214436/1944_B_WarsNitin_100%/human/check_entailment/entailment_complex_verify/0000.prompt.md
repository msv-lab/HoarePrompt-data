You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, the function needs to find two subsets `l` and `r` of length 2k from the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain the elements from the sorted halves of the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, and these lists will be printed. The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final values of `t` and `q` will be the same as the initial values, while `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it finds two subsets `ans1` and `ans2` of length 2k from the first and second halves of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2`. The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated and reset for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 1
1 1
```

**Issue:**
The program incorrectly handles the case when the first and last elements of the sorted halves `b` and `c` are the same. It appends the last element of `b` to `ans1` twice, which is incorrect. The program should ensure that the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are distinct and form valid subsets of the respective halves of the array.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in the sorted halves `b` and `c` are not in pairs. It should ensure that the elements are paired correctly to form valid subsets that satisfy the XOR condition. The current logic may lead to incorrect subsets being formed, especially when the elements are not in pairs or when the program tries to balance the elements between `ans1` and `ans2`.

These issues make the program incorrect for the given problem description.
