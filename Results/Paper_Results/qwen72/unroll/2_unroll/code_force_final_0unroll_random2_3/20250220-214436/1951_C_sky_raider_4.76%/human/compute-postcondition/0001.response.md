Output State: **For each test case, the output state is the integer value of c, which represents the minimum total cost to buy k tickets, considering the constraints and the sorted list of ticket prices.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from input, and a list `l` of ticket prices is also read and sorted.
- The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is a starting point for the total cost.
- The inner loop iterates over the sorted list `l` and updates `s` to the minimum of `m` and `k`, then decreases `k` by `s` and updates `c` by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets at the price `l[i]` minus the cost of buying `s` tickets at the maximum rate `m`.
- After the inner loop finishes, the integer value of `c` is printed, which represents the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets.
- The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` for the next test case is unaffected by the previous test case's loop execution.
