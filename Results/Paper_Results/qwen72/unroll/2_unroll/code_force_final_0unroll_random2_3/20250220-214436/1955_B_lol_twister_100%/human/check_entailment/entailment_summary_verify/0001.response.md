### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` and the list `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**:
   - The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is a valid approach because the minimum element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - This formula correctly represents the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
   - This is a valid approach because the elements of the progressive square should match the elements in the input list, regardless of their initial order.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
  - The lists are not equal, so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]`
  - The lists are equal, so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2 100 100` and `400 300 400 500`
  - Minimum element `a` is `300`.
  - Generated list: `[300, 400, 400, 500]`
  - Sorted input list: `[300, 400, 400, 500]`
  - The lists are equal, so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 11]`
  - The lists are not equal (due to the duplicate `6`), so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `4 4 4` and `15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15`
  - Minimum element `a` is `3`.
  - Generated list: `[3, 7, 11, 15, 7, 11, 15, 19, 11, 15, 19, 23, 15, 19, 23, 27]`
  - Sorted input list: `[3, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 15, 15, 15, 15, 19, 19, 23, 23, 23, 27]`
  - The lists are not equal (due to the duplicate `15` and `23`), so the output is `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`. The reasoning and steps are sound, and the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
