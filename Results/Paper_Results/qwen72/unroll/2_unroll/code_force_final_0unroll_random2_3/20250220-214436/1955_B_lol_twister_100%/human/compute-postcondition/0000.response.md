Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n^2, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.**

The value of `a` is now the smallest integer in the list `l`, while the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The list `l` also remains unchanged.
