Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list of integers `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum element in the list will be `a_{1,1}`, which is the starting element of the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each element in the matrix, where `k` and `h` are the row and column indices, respectively. This is in line with the problem's rules for constructing the progressive square.

4. **Sorting and Comparing**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input list `l` contains exactly the elements of the progressive square, and the program returns "yes". Otherwise, it returns "no".

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs "yes" or "no" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

The program handles the constraints and the problem requirements correctly, ensuring that the elements of the input list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
