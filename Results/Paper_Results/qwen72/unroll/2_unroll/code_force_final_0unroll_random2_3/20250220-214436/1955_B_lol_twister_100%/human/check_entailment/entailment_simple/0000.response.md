### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these values.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum element in the list will be the starting point for constructing the progressive square.

3. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program constructs a new list `li` by iterating over all possible indices `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, which correctly follows the rules for constructing the progressive square.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`.
   - If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the elements in `l` can form the progressive square.
   - If they are not equal, it returns 'no', indicating that the elements in `l` cannot form the progressive square.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `2 <= n <= 500`, `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`, and `1 <= l[i] <= 10^9`.
   - The program ensures that the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `25 * 10^4`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining if the given elements can form a progressive square based on the provided rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
