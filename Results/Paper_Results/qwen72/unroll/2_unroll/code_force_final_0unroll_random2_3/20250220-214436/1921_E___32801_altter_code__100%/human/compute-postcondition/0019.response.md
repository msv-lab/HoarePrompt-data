Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is a list of integers.
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`.
   - `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - The current values of `y1` and `y2` are such that `y1 == y2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly.
   - The condition `y1 == y2` is contradictory to the condition `y1` is not equal to `y2`. However, since the `print` statement does not depend on these conditions, the contradiction does not impact the output.

Given the above analysis, the `print` statement will output the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
