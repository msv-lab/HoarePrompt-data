Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each. However, `func_1()` is not defined to take any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) as parameters.

2. **Initial Check**: The first check in `func_1()` is to see if `x2 <= x1`. If true, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row, and Alice cannot move down to Bob's row. This check is correct.

3. **Odd Difference Case**:
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, Alice can potentially win if she can move her chip to the same column as Bob's chip. The program checks if `y1 == y2` and prints "Alice" if true, which is correct.
   - If `y1` and `y2` are not in the same column, the program tries to move Alice's chip one step towards Bob's chip and checks again. If `y1` and `y2` are now in the same column, it prints "Alice," which is correct.
   - The program then calculates the number of moves `a` and `b` and adjusts the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It then checks if the game ends in a draw by verifying if the new positions are valid and if Bob cannot catch Alice. This logic is complex but seems to follow the rules correctly.

4. **Even Difference Case**:
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, Bob can potentially win if he can move his chip to the same column as Alice's chip. The program checks if `y1 == y2` and prints "Bob" if true, which is correct.
   - If `y1` and `y2` are not in the same column, the program tries to move Bob's chip one step towards Alice's chip and checks again. If `y1` and `y2` are now in the same column, it prints "Bob," which is correct.
   - The program then calculates the number of moves `a` and `b` and adjusts the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It then checks if the game ends in a draw by verifying if the new positions are valid and if Alice cannot catch Bob. This logic is complex but seems to follow the rules correctly.

5. **Return Values**: The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description as it only requires printing the outcome.

6. **Boundary Conditions**: The program correctly handles boundary conditions by checking if the new positions of the chips are within the board's dimensions.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1()` is not defined to take parameters, which is a significant error. The function should be defined as `def func_1(h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):` to match the problem description.

Given these points, the program is **incorrect** due to the missing parameter definition in the function `func_1()`.

Correctness: **False**
