Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Conditions:
- If `y2 <= y1`, then:
  - `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + (r[5] - 1)`.
  - `x2` is equal to `r[4] - (r[5] - 1)`.
  - `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1 - (r[5] - 1)`.
  - `y2` is equal to 1.
  - `a` is equal to `r[5] - 1`.
  - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
  - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
  - `t` is equal to `abs(1 - (r[3] - 1))`.
  - `c` is equal to `y1 - 1`.

- Otherwise, if `y2 > y1`, then:
  - `y1` is now equal to `y1 + a`.
  - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
  - `y1` is less than `y2`.
  - `y2` is now equal to `m`.
  - `c` is equal to `m - y1`.
  - `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.

- Additionally, either:
  - `b // 2 <= a`, or
  - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or
  - `y1 < 1`, or
  - `y1 > m`, or
  - `x1 < 1`, or
  - `x1 > n`.

### Analysis:
The `print('draw')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'draw'`. The conditions and initial state provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. They only describe the state of the program before the print statement is executed.

### Output:
The code prints the string `'draw'`.
Output: **draw**
