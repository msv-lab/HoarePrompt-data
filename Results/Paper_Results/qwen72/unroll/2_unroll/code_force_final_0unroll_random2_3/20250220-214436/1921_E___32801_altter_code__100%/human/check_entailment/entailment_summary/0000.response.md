### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to determine the game outcome.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's row (`if x2 <= x1`). If so, it immediately prints "draw" because Alice cannot move down and Bob cannot move up, leading to a draw.

3. **Odd and Even Turn Differences:**
   - The program then checks if the difference in rows between Bob's and Alice's chips is odd (`if (x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`).
   - If the difference is odd, it further checks if Alice can win by moving her chip to Bob's position or if a draw is inevitable.

4. **Alice's Winning Conditions:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd and Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`if y1 == y2`), Alice wins immediately.
   - If Alice's and Bob's chips are not in the same column, the program simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to check if Alice can force a win:
     - It adjusts Alice's and Bob's positions to see if Alice can move her chip to Bob's position.
     - It calculates the number of moves Alice can make (`a`) and the number of moves Bob can make (`b`).
     - It then checks if Alice can force Bob into a position where she can win or if a draw is inevitable.

5. **Bob's Winning Conditions:**
   - If the difference in rows is even, the program checks if Bob can win by moving his chip to Alice's position or if a draw is inevitable.
   - Similar to Alice's winning conditions, it adjusts Bob's and Alice's positions to see if Bob can force a win.
   - It calculates the number of moves Bob can make (`a`) and the number of moves Alice can make (`b`).
   - It then checks if Bob can force Alice into a position where he can win or if a draw is inevitable.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly checks if the new positions of Alice's and Bob's chips are within the board boundaries (`1 <= y1 <= m` and `1 <= x1 <= n`).

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "bob", or "draw" based on the calculated conditions.

### Correctness:
- The program seems to handle the game logic correctly, considering the rules and the optimal play for both Alice and Bob.
- The logic for determining the outcome based on the positions and the turn differences is sound.
- The boundary checks ensure that the chips do not move outside the board.

However, there are a few minor issues:
- The function `func_1` should be called inside the loop after reading the input for each test case.
- The output for Bob's win should be consistent with the problem description, which states that the output can be in any case. Therefore, "Bob" should be printed instead of "bob".

### Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output case for Bob's win. This can be fixed by changing `print('bob')` to `print('Bob')`.
