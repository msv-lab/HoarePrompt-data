### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries of the form \( "? a b c d" \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Initial Query Strategy:**
   - The program starts by initializing `v1` to 0.
   - It then iterates over all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and makes a query \( "? v1 v1 i i" \) to compare \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \).
   - If the response is '<', it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` is the index of the largest value in the permutation \( p \).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - After finding the largest value in the permutation, the program initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It then iterates over all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) again and makes a query \( "? v1 i v1 prev" \) to compare \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \).
   - If the response is '>', it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` is the index of the value that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program outputs \( "! prev v1" \) as the indices that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop also makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for all \( n \ge 2 \).

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the largest value in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the value that, when XORed with the largest value, gives the maximum result.
   - The program ensures that the total number of queries does not exceed \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
