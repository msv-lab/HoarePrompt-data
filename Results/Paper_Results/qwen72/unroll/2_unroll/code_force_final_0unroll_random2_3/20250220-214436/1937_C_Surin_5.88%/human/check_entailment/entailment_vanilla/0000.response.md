### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? \ a \ b \ c \ d \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).
   - The interactor will respond with "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison.

2. **Initial Strategy**:
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) of the maximum element in the permutation \( p \) using the first set of queries.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_0 \mid p_0) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \). Since \( p_i \mid p_i = p_i \), this effectively finds the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Second Strategy**:
   - Once the maximum element \( p_{v1} \) is found, the program then tries to find the index \( prev \) of the element that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \). If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).

4. **Queries Analysis**:
   - The first set of queries (finding \( v1 \)) uses \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second set of queries (finding \( prev \)) uses \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer, which is a valid pair since \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest valid \( n \) (which is 2) correctly.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
