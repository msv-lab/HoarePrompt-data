Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. It uses a strategy to find the maximum XOR value by first identifying the element with the maximum value using the bitwise OR operation, and then finding the element that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum result. The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of 3n by efficiently using the queries. The logic and the flow of the program are consistent with the requirements of the problem, and it correctly handles the interactive nature of the problem by flushing the output after each query and answer.
