The code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, returning a list of these integers. This function does not change any existing variables but provides a mechanism for reading and processing input.

Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged, and a lambda function `I` is defined that can be used to read a list of integers from input.**
