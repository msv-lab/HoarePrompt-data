### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \) where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the \( i \)-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either the left or right border.
   - We need to answer \( n \) queries, each placing the pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to calculate the cumulative sum of certain indices in the array.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a list to keep track of cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
     - `ans` is an array to store the results for each query.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is populated with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single 0.
     - `ans` is initialized with zeros.

   - **Loop through the grid from right to left:**
     - For each cell \( i \):
       - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the cell contains '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

   - **Calculations:**
     - The calculations involve using the cumulative sums to determine the number of steps the pinball takes to leave the grid.
     - The logic for updating `preOne` and `suffZero` ensures that the cumulative sums are correctly maintained as the pinball moves and the characters are inverted.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for handling both '<' and '>' characters is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program prints the results for each query as required.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
