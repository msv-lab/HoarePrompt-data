The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the user. It then processes these strings to determine a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is a combination of the two input strings based on specific conditions, and `t` is a value calculated based on the positions where these conditions are met. The function prints the modified string `s` (if it is not empty) and the integer `t`. The function does not return any values, and its behavior is undefined if `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2 Â· 10^5, or if the input strings are not of length `n`.
