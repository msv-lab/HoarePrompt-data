Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is an empty list.**
