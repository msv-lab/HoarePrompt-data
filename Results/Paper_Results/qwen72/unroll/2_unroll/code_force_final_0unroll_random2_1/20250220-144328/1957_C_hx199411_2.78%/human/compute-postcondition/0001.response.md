The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is already within this range, it is guaranteed to be non-zero, and thus the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers such that 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n and the moves do not result in any rooks attacking each other.**
