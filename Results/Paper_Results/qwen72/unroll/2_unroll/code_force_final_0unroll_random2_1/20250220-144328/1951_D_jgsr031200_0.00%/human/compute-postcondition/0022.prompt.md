You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k.
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k.
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: `n = 0`, `h = (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1) + (n - k + 1) // 1`, `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The code snippet `print('YES')` will execute because the condition `h >= k` is true.
        #
        #Output:
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 0 1
    #State: *`n` is 0, `h` is calculated as `(n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1) + (n - k + 1) // 1`, and `costs` is a list with values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. If `h` is less than `k`, then `h < k`. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function returns `None` in Case_1 and does not return anything in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
