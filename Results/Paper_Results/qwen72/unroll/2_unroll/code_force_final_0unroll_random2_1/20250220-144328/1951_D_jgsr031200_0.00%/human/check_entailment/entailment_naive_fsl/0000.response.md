Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for setting up the stalls and their prices is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
3 3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
YES
9 1
```

The program outputs `2` stalls with prices `9` and `1`, but this setup does not ensure that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. Instead, Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (leaving her with 1 coin) and then 1 jewel from the second stall (leaving her with 0 coins), resulting in a total of 2 jewels, which is incorrect.

The program should be able to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and it should handle all edge cases, including when `n` is much larger than `k`. The current implementation does not achieve this.
