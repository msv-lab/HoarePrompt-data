Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. The program checks three main conditions:

1. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `1` (indicating one stall with price 1), and returns. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and she needs to buy `k` jewels, she can buy all the jewels from a single stall with price 1, and the remaining 0 coins will not be enough to buy any more jewels.

2. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program calculates a list `costs` with values `[n - k + 1, 1]` and a variable `h` which is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`. It then prints 'NO' if `h` is less than `k`, or prints '2', 'YES', and the values in `costs` if `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic in the third case:

- The calculation of `costs` and `h` is not correct for the problem's requirements. The idea is to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but the current logic does not ensure this. Specifically, the list `costs` is set to `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and `h` is calculated as the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`. This does not necessarily guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

- The final state of `n` being 0 is not a requirement of the problem. The program should focus on ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, not on how many coins are left.

A correct approach would be to set up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One simple and effective way is to set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin. This way, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and the remaining coins will not be enough to buy any more jewels. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at most `10^18`, and we can set up at most 60 stalls, this approach is always valid for `k <= 60`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > 60:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(k)
    print(' '.join(str(1) for _ in range(k)))
```

This corrected version ensures that:

- If `k` is greater than 60, it prints 'NO' because Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by `k` (the number of stalls), and then `k` prices, each set to 1. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given the original program's logic, it does not correctly handle the third case and may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
