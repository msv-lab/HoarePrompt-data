Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` contains the character 'G'. According to the problem description, each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. However, the program only checks for the characters 'A' to 'F' in the string `s`. This means that if the string `s` does not contain any 'G' characters, the program will not account for the need to create additional 'G' problems, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
The correct output should be 3 (one for 'A', one for 'F', and one for 'G'), but the program will output 2 because it does not check for 'G'.
