t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The array b contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
