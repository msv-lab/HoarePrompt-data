Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal path to get the lexicographically smallest string involves switching rows more than once. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
6
010101
000000
```

The lexicographically smallest string should be `0000000`, and there are 2 paths that yield this string:
1. Move right, right, down, right, right, right, down.
2. Move down, right, right, right, right, right, down.

However, the program will output:
```
0000000
1
```

This is incorrect because it only considers the first instance where a switch to the other row can produce a lexicographically smaller string and does not account for the possibility of multiple switches. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
