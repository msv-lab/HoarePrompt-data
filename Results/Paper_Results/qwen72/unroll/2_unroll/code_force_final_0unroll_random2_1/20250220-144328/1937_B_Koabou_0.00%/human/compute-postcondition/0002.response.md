The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(2)` loop. The loop will execute 2 times regardless of the initial state of any other variables, as long as the range is defined as `range(2)`.

Given the loop head, the loop will execute 2 times, and the variable `_` will take the values 0 and 1 during these iterations. No adjustments to the loop head variables are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, the loop will execute 2 times**
