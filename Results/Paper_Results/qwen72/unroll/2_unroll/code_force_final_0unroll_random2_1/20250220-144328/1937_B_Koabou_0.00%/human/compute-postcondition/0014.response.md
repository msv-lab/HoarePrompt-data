The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings `a1` and `a2` where `a1[i]` and `a2[i]` represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in `a1` and `a2` consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to `n[i]`. The sum of all `n[i]` values does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the two rows of the grid can be made identical by flipping any number of columns. If it is possible, the function returns `True` for that test case; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case, and two lists of binary strings `a1` and `a2` representing the two rows of the grid for each test case. It returns a list of boolean values, where each value indicates whether the two rows of the grid can be made identical by flipping any number of columns for the corresponding test case.**
