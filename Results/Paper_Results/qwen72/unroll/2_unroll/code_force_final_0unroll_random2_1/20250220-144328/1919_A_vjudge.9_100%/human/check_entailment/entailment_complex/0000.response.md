Reasoning:

The problem states that Alice and Bob take turns removing a coin from their wallets, and they can choose to swap wallets or keep their current one. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses. The key to solving this problem is understanding the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of coins in the wallets.

1. **Initial State and Turn Mechanics**:
   - Alice starts with `a` coins and Bob starts with `b` coins.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current one.
   - After the choice, the player must remove one coin from the current wallet.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The player who is forced to remove a coin from an empty wallet loses.
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (or differs by an even number), the game will always end in a situation where both wallets are empty at the same time, and the player whose turn it is will lose. This is because the total number of moves (each player removing one coin) will be even, and the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to lose.
   - If the number of coins differs by an odd number, the game will end with one wallet having one more coin than the other, and the player whose turn it is will be able to make the last move, forcing the opponent to lose. This is because the total number of moves will be odd, and the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to win.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the difference is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The program processes multiple test cases as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
