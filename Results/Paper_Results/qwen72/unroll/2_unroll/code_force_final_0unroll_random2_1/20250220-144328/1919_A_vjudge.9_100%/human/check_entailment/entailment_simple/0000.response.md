Reasoning:  
The game described involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin from it. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially a parity (odd/even) game. Each player, on their turn, can either swap wallets or remove a coin, but the removal of a coin is mandatory. This means that the number of coins a player can remove before the wallet becomes empty is determined by the initial number of coins in the wallet.

If the initial number of coins in both wallets is the same (or differs by an even number), the game will always end in a situation where both wallets become empty at the same time, and the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move. Since Alice starts, if the difference in the number of coins is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move.

If the initial number of coins differs by an odd number, the game will end with one wallet having one more coin than the other, and the player with the extra coin will be able to make the last move, winning the game. Since Alice starts, if the difference in the number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she will be the one to make the last move.

The program checks the parity of the difference between `a` and `b` and prints the winner accordingly. This logic is correct based on the game rules and the optimal play assumption.

Correctness: **True**
