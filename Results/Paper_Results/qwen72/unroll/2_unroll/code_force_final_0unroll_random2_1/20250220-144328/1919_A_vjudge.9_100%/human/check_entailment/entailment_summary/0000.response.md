Reasoning:  
The provided program is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic is that if the difference is even, Bob will win, and if the difference is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game involves alternating moves where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the player who is forced to make a move when both wallets are empty loses.

To understand why this logic works, consider the following:
- If the difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, then after each complete round (i.e., both Alice and Bob have made a move), the difference remains even. This means that the player who starts with fewer coins will eventually be forced to make a move when both wallets are empty, leading to a loss.
- If the difference is odd, then after each complete round, the difference becomes even. This means that the player who starts with more coins will eventually be forced to make a move when both wallets are empty, leading to a win for the player who started with fewer coins.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` for each test case. If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the difference is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

The execution summary confirms that the function processes the input correctly and prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
