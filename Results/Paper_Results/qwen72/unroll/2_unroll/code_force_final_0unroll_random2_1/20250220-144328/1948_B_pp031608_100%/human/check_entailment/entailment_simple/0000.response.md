### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The function assumes that the array can be made non-decreasing (`ans = True`).

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).

4. **Operation Simulation**:
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, it simulates the operation by splitting the previous element into its digits and appending the current element to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order (`if nums != sorted(nums)`).
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints `YES` if the array can be made non-decreasing, otherwise `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The operation described in the problem is to replace an element with its digits, not to append the current element to the list of digits.
   - The correct approach should be to replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and then check if the array can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Incorrect Check**:
   - The current implementation checks if the list of digits plus the current element is sorted, which is not the correct check.
   - The correct check should be to see if the array can be made non-decreasing after replacing the element with its digits.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the element to be replaced is less than 10, which should not trigger the operation.
   - The program should also ensure that the array is checked for non-decreasing order after each operation.

### Corrected Approach:

1. **Replace Element with Digits**:
   - When `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits.
   - Flatten the array to ensure it remains a list of integers.

2. **Check Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - After each replacement, check if the array is non-decreasing.
   - If the array becomes non-decreasing, continue to the next test case.
   - If it cannot be made non-decreasing, set `ans` to `False` and break out of the loop.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the operation and does not properly check if the array can be made non-decreasing.

### Correctness:
**False**
