Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the transformation of elements and checks the sorted condition. Specifically, the program only checks the transformation of the current element and the next element in the array when it finds a pair that is out of order. However, it should consider the transformation of the current element and then re-evaluate the entire array to ensure it remains sorted after the transformation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1):
            if arr[i] >= 10 or arr[i + 1] >= 10:
                # Transform the element if it is >= 10
                if arr[i] >= 10:
                    arr[i] = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                if arr[i + 1] >= 10:
                    arr[i + 1] = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i + 1])]
                
                # Flatten the list if any element was transformed
                arr = [item for sublist in arr for item in (sublist if isinstance(sublist, list) else [sublist])]
                
                # Check if the array is sorted after transformation
                if arr != sorted(arr):
                    ans = False
                    break
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
1. Any element that is 10 or greater is transformed into its constituent digits.
2. The array is flattened after any transformation to ensure it remains a list of integers.
3. The entire array is checked for sorted order after any transformation.

This should correctly determine whether the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operations.
