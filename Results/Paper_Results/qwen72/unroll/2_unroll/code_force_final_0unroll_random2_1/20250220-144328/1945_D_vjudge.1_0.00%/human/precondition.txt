The function `moedasMinimas` should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the cost to bribe the person at position i, a list of integers `b` representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1, and two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The function should be defined as `def moedasMinimas(a, b, n, m):`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
