The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the range `n - k` to `n` is valid and contains at least one element. This means that `n` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at `n - k`.

State: **`soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `pref` is the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` before the last `k` elements, plus the sum of `soma_b` values accumulated during these iterations, `resultado` is infinity, `i` is `n - k`, `n` must be greater than `k`**
