You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Example

Input

    5
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5
    
    8
    
    8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
    
    5
    
    3 3 3 3 3
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    3
    1
    0
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = l[0]
        b = 0
        c = 0
        y = 0
        for y in range(1, n):
            if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
                b = l[y]
                break
        for x in range(y + 1, n):
            if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
                if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
                c += 1
            elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
                if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
            elif a >= l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        print(c)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then identifies two elements `a` and `b` from the list `l` and counts the number of elements in `l` that satisfy certain conditions relative to `a` and `b`. The function prints the count `c` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `l` are re-initialized for each test case, so their values do not persist across test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already in non-increasing or non-decreasing order. In such cases, the optimal penalty is 0, but the program does not correctly compute this.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
The array is in non-increasing order, and the optimal penalty is 0. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect.
