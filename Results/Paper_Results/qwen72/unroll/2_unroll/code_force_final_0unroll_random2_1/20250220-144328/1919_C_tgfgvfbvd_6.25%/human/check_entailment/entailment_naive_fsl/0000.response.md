Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already in non-increasing or non-decreasing order. In such cases, the optimal penalty is 0, but the program does not correctly compute this.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
The array is in non-increasing order, and the optimal penalty is 0. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect.
