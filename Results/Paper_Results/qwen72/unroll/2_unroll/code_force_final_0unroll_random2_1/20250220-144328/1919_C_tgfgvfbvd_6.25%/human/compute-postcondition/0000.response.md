The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, but they are part of the initial state provided.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop is iterating over `int(input())`, we can assume that `t` is the number of test cases, and `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the constraint on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `_` is 0 (but will be incremented by the loop), and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (which is ensured by the constraint on `t`)**
