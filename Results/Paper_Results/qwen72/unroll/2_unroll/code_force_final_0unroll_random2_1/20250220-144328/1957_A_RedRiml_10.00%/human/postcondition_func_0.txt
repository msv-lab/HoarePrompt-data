The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `w` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of `ln` integers from the input. The function processes each list to count the number of unique integers that appear at least 3 times and prints this count. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (mentioned in the initial state) are not used or modified by the function. After processing all `w` test cases, the function completes and the values of `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` are not retained.
