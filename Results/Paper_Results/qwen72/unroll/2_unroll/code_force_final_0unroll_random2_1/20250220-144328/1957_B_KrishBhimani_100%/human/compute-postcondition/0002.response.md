The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints, it seems to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers. The constraints are as follows: `1 <= t <= 10^4` (where `t` is the number of test cases), `1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, but the specific output logic is not provided in the question. Therefore, the general functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.**
