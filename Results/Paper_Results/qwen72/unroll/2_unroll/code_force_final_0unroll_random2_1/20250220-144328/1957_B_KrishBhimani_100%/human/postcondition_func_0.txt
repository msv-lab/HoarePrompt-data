The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints the value of `k`. Otherwise, it prints a sequence of `n` integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the second integer is `k` minus the first integer, and the remaining `n-2` integers are 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case remain unchanged after the function execution.
