The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it represents the number of test cases, which is what `int(input())` should read. Therefore, the state of `t` indirectly affects the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
