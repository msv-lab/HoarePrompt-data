Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints a sequence of integers. If n == 1, it prints the value of k. Otherwise, it prints a sequence of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is k minus the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0. The values of t, n, and k for each test case remain unchanged.**
