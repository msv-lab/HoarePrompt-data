Output State: **After the loop finishes, `t` is decremented by the number of iterations, `n` and `k` retain their last assigned values from the last iteration, and `adj` is the last constructed adjacency list for the tree with `n` vertices. The variables `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` are reset to their initial values or updated based on the last iteration's conditions, and the final value of `L` is printed for each iteration.**
