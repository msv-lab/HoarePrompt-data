Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for all potential cases:

1. **Sorting the List of Strings**: The program sorts the list of numbers as strings, which can lead to incorrect sorting. For example, if the input is `10 2 1`, it will be sorted as `['1', '10', '2']` instead of `[1, 2, 10]`. This can cause the program to select the wrong pairs and compute an incorrect score.

2. **Converting to Integers**: The program converts the numbers to integers after popping them from the list, but it should convert them to integers before sorting to ensure the correct order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the input might not be valid, such as if the number of integers is not exactly 2n.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        for j in range(numInteger):
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are converted to integers before sorting, and it correctly handles the pairs to compute the maximum score.
