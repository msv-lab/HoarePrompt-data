The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numCases`. If `numCases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
