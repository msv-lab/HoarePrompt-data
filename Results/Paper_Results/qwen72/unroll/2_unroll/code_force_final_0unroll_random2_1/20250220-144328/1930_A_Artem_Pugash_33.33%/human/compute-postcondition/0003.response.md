The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 5000), `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), and `a` (a list of 2n integers, each between 1 and 10^7). It returns a result based on the values of these parameters.**
