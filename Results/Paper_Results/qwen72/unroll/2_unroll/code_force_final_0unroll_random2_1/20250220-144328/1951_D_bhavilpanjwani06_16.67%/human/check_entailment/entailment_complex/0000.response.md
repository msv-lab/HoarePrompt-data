Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels with \( n \) coins. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Check (`n < k`)**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it's impossible for her to buy \( k \) jewels. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

2. **Exact Match (`n == k`)**:
   - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, Bob can set up a single stall with the price of \( n \) coins per jewel. Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall, and the program correctly prints "YES", followed by "1" and \( n \).

3. **Excess Coins (`n > k`)**:
   - The program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \). This condition is true if \( k \) is less than \( \frac{n + 2}{2} \).
   - If this condition is true, Bob can set up two stalls:
     - The first stall with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins per jewel, which ensures Alice buys exactly one jewel from this stall.
     - The second stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, which ensures Alice buys the remaining \( k - 1 \) jewels.
   - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
   - If the condition \( k - 1 \ge n - k + 1 \) is true, the program prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy exactly \( k \) jewels with the given constraints.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The condition \( k - 1 \ge n - k + 1 \) is not the correct way to determine if it's impossible to set up the stalls. The correct approach is to always check if \( k \) can be achieved with at most 60 stalls, and if so, provide a valid configuration.

### Correct Approach:
- If \( n < k \), it's impossible, so print "NO".
- If \( n \ge k \), it is always possible to set up \( k \) stalls with prices \( 1, 1, \ldots, 1 \) (where each stall has a price of 1 coin). This ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each of the \( k \) stalls.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(['1'] * k))
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Check (`n < k`)**: If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, print "NO".
- **Otherwise (`n >= k`)**: Print "YES", followed by the number of stalls \( k \), and the prices for each stall as 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

Given the original program's logic and the problem requirements, the original program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where \( n \ge k \) and \( k - 1 \ge n - k + 1 \) correctly.

Correctness: **False**
