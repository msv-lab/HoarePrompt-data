The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **2**
