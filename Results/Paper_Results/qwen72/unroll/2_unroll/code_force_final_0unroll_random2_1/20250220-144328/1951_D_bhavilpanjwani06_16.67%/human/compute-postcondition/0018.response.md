The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `n` represents the number of coins Alice has, and `k` represents the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function should handle up to 1000 test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

For each test case, the function returns the number of jewels Alice can buy with her coins. If `n` is less than `k`, the function returns 0, indicating that Alice cannot buy the desired number of jewels. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function returns the number of jewels Alice can buy, which is the integer division of `n` by `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) where `n` is the number of coins Alice has and `k` is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. For each test case, if `n` is less than `k`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of `n` by `k`, indicating the number of jewels Alice can buy.**
