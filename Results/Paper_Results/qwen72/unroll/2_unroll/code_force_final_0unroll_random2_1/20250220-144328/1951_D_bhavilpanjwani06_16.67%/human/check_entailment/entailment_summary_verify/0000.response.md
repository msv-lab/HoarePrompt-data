### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Case 1: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. The function correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 2: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. The function correctly prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`.
   - **Case 3: `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**
     - This condition checks if Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin. If this condition is true, the function prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - **Case 4: `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`**
     - If the above condition is not met, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Cases:

- **Case 1: `n < k`**
  - This is straightforward. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels, she cannot buy `k` jewels. The function correctly handles this case.

- **Case 2: `n == k`**
  - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. This is a valid solution, and the function correctly handles this case.

- **Case 3: `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**
  - This condition can be simplified to `2k - 1 < n`. If this is true, Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The function correctly handles this case.

- **Case 4: `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`**
  - This condition can be simplified to `2k - 1 >= n`. In this case, the function prints "NO". However, this is not always correct. For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 5`, the condition `2k - 1 >= n` is false (`9 >= 100` is false), but the program still prints "NO" because it does not consider other possible solutions.

### Example Input and Output:

- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  7 3
  6 4
  255 8
  ```

- **Output:**
  ```
  YES
  10
  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
  NO
  YES
  8
  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - **Test Case 1: `7 3`**
    - The program outputs "YES" and sets up 10 stalls with prices `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11`. Alice will buy 3 jewels from the first stall and be left with 1 coin, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 2: `6 4`**
    - The program outputs "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.
  - **Test Case 3: `255 8`**
    - The program outputs "YES" and sets up 8 stalls with prices `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels, which is correct.

### Additional Test Case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  100 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  5
  20 20 20 20 20
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  YES
  2
  96 1
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The actual output is incorrect because Alice will buy only 1 jewel from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 2 jewels, not 5. This shows that the program does not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to handle cases where `n` is much larger than `k` and there are multiple possible ways to set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The function `func_1` does not consider all possible valid solutions and only checks a limited set of conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
