Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `n` is now assigned a value from the input which is an integer. `k` is also assigned a value from the input which is an integer. The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**
