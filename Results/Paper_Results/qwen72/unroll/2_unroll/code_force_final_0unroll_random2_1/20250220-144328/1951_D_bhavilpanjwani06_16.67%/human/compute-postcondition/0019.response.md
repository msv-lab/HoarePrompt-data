Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), where `n` represents the number of coins Alice has and `k` represents the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. For each test case, the function checks if Alice has enough coins to buy the jewels. If `n` is less than `k`, the function prints "NO". If `n` is equal to `k`, the function prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the function prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console. **
