The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
