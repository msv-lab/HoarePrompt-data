Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The approach taken by the program involves counting the number of 0s and 1s in the string and using these counts to determine the cost of making the string sorted.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **String Conversion**: Each binary string `s` is converted to a list of integers, which allows for easier manipulation of the characters.
3. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the total number of 0s in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a running count of 0s and 1s encountered so far in the list `cnt`.
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - If `c` is 0, the program checks if there are any 1s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`). If there are, it adds 1 to the cost `ans` because a 0 following a 1 requires a shift to move the 0 to the left.
     - If `c` is 1, the program adds the number of remaining 0s that need to be moved to the left of this 1 to the cost `ans`. This is calculated as `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which represents the number of 0s that have not yet been encountered.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost `ans` for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `10`
  - `zeroes = 1`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0 + (1 - 0) = 1`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `0000`
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [2, 0]`, `ans = 0`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [3, 0]`, `ans = 0`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [4, 0]`, `ans = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `11000`
  - `zeroes = 3`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0 + (3 - 0) = 3`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 3 + (3 - 0) = 6`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 6 + 1 = 7`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 7 + 1 = 8`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 8 + 1 = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `101011`
  - `zeroes = 2`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0 + (2 - 0) = 2`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 3 + (2 - 1) = 4`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 5 + (2 - 2) = 5`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 5 + (2 - 2) = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `01101001`
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 0 + (4 - 1) = 3`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 3 + (4 - 1) = 6`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 6 + 1 = 7`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 7 + (4 - 2) = 9`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 9 + 1 = 10`
  - Processing `0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 10 + 1 = 11`
  - Processing `1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 11 + (4 - 4) = 11`
  - Output: `11` (Correct)
