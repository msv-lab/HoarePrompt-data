The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used for any specific purpose outside of the loop iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
