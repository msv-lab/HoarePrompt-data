### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of operations.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to the correct position.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `10` can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2.
  - **Annotated Code Explanation:**
    - `s = [1, 0]`
    - `zeroes = 1`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Final `ans = 2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0000`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The string `0000` is already sorted, so no operations are needed.
  - **Annotated Code Explanation:**
    - `s = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
    - `zeroes = 4`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 1: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 0]` -> `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 0]` -> `ans = 0`

    - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 0]` -> `ans = 0`
    - Final `ans = 0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `11000`
  - Output: `9`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves three operations, each costing 3.
  - **Annotated Code Explanation:**
    - `s = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
    - `zeroes = 3`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 3`
    - Iteration 2: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 2]` -> `ans = 6`
    - Iteration 3: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 7` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 8` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 5: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 2]` -> `ans = 9` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Final `ans = 9`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `101011`
  - Output: `5`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 5.
  - **Annotated Code Explanation:**
    - `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
    - `zeroes = 2`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - `ans = 0`
    - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 2`
    - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 3` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 3: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 4`
    - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 5` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 5: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 3]` -> `ans = 5`
    - Iteration 6: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 4]` -> `ans = 5`
    - Final `ans = 5`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `01101001`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 11.
  - **Annotated Code Explanation:**
    - `s = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
    - `zeroes = 4`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - `ans = 0`

    - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 9` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 5: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 3]` -> `ans = 10`
    - Iteration 6: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 3]` -> `ans = 11` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Iteration 7: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 3]` -> `ans = 11`
    - Iteration 8: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [4, 4]` -> `ans = 11`
    - Final `ans = 11`
