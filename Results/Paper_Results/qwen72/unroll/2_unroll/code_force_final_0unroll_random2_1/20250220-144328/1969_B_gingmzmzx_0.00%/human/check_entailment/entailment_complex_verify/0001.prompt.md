You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string s. The input to the function should be a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)

            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a binary string `s`, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates the value of `ans` based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the string. After each iteration, `ans` is printed, and the variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reset in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes the string to calculate a value `ans`, and prints this value. The value `ans` is computed based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the string `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the only variable that remains unchanged is `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of operations.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to the correct position.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the minimum total cost to sort the binary string is based on the idea of counting the number of cyclic shifts needed to move each `0` to the left of any `1` that appears before it.
- The program correctly accounts for the cost of each operation by summing up the necessary shifts.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `10` can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0000`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The string `0000` is already sorted, so no operations are needed.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `11000`
  - Output: `9`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves three operations, each costing 3.
- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `101011`
  - Output: `5`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 5.
- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `01101001`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 11.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles all the test cases correctly and follows the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
