You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string s. The input to the function should be a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a binary string `s`, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates the value of `ans` based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the string. After each iteration, `ans` is printed, and the variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reset in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of binary strings, where each string has a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, and the total length of all strings combined does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input list of binary strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
