The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes the string to calculate a value `ans`, and prints this value. The value `ans` is computed based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the string `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the only variable that remains unchanged is `n`.
