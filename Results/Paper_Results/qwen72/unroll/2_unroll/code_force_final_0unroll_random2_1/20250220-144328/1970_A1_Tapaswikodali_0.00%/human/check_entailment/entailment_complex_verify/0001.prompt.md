You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: `balance` is 0, `details` is a list containing tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in the string `s`, where `balance` is the current balance of parentheses, `i` is the index of the character in the string, and `char` is the character at that index.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is the original string from which the `details` list was created)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a non-empty balanced parentheses string `s` from the user input, processes it to generate a sorted list of tuples representing the balance of parentheses, negative index, and character at each position, and then prints the original string `s` in the order of the sorted list. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from the input. This is correct as per the problem statement, which specifies that the input is a single line containing a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program maintains a variable `balance` to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string. For each character:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   This correctly computes the balance of the prefix ending at each character.

3. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, negative position, and character in a list `details`. The negative position is used to ensure that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position. This is correct because the problem statement requires sorting by balance and then by position in decreasing order.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and negative position. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, with ties broken in decreasing order of position.

5. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together. This correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
