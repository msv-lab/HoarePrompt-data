You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))

            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user, and 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for finding the maximum balance of the problemset is flawed. The program attempts to find the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`, but it does not always find the correct maximum balance.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the input:
```
1
10 2
```
The expected output should be `5` because the optimal way to break up the difficulty `10` into `2` sub-problems is to have difficulties `5` and `5`, giving a balance of `5`.

However, the program outputs `2` because it only checks divisors up to the square root of `x` and does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a divisor of `x`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should consider all divisors of `x` and check if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems. The correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `n` and then use that to determine the maximum balance.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = x // n
    if x % n == 0:
        ans = x // n
    else:
        ans = gcd(x, n)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum balance is correctly calculated for all potential cases.
