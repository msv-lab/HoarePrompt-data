Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. The function then prints this value. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the calculated value, which is printed to the console. **
