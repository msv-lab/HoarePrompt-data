Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user, and 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The conditions 1 <= t <= 10^3, 1 <= n <= x, and `x` and `n` being integers provided by the user are still valid.
