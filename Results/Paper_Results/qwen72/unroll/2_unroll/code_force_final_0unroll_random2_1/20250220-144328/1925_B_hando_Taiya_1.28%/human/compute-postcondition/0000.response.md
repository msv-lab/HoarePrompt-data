The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer. The new values of `x` and `n` are the integers provided by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user, and 1 <= n <= x.**
