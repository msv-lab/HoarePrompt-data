You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each screen has a grid of size 5x3, which means it has 15 cells.
   - There are two types of icons: 1x1 (occupies 1 cell) and 2x2 (occupies 4 cells).
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `ap`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.
   - The program then handles different cases based on the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
     - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total number of cells available on the screens calculated for 2x2 icons.
     - The remaining cells are used to place the 1x1 icons. If there are not enough cells left, additional screens are calculated using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The program prints 0, as no icons need to be placed.

4. **Verification of Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can fit 2 of the 2x2 icons, so `math.ceil(y / 2)` is the correct calculation.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct. Each screen has 15 cells, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is the correct calculation.
   - The program correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 by printing 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where only one type of icon is present by directly calculating the required screens for that type.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` seems incorrect. It should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The program should ensure that the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is subtracted from the total available cells on the screens calculated for 2x2 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)

func_1()
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The corrected program should use `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons.
