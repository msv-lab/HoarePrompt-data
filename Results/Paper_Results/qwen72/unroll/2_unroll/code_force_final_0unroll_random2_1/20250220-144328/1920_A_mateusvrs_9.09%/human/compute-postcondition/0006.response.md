Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints, and then reads `n` pairs of integers (a, x) where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The function calculates the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for each test case, where `bx` is the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2, and `cx` is a set of values for constraints of type 3. The function prints the results for each test case, one per line. The length of the printed results is equal to `t`. **
