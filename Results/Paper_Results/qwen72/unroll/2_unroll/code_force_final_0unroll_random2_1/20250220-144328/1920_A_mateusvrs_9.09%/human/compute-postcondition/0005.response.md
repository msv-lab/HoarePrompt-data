Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 in each test case.**
