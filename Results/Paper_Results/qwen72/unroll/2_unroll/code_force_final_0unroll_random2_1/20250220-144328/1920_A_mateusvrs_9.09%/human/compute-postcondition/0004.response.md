To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- Each integer in `r` represents the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for each test case.
- The length of `r` is equal to `t`, the number of test cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function with the `*` operator unpacks the list `r` and prints each element on a new line.
- The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each element of the list `r` is separated by a newline character.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Each element in `r` is an integer representing the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for each test case.

Output: **[r[0]]
[r[1]]
...
[r[t-1]] (where each r[i] is the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for the i-th test case)**

This output format ensures that each element of the list `r` is printed on a new line, as specified by the `sep='\n'` argument in the `print` function.
