### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraint Handling:**
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small number (`-1`) to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Range Validation:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no valid `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - It calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.
   - It appends this count to the result list `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints:**
  - The program correctly handles the type 1 and type 2 constraints by setting `bx` and `ax` to the appropriate bounds.
  - It ensures that `bx` is the maximum of all lower bounds and `ax` is the minimum of all upper bounds.

- **Type 3 Constraints:**
  - The program correctly handles the type 3 constraints by adding the values to the set `cx`.
  - It then checks if any of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of such values from the total range.

- **Range Validation:**
  - The program correctly checks if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid (i.e., `bx` is less than `ax`).

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the constraints as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
