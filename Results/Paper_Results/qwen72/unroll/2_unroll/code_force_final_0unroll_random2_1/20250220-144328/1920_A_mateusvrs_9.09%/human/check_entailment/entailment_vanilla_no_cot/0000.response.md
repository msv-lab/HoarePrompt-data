Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes each test case by identifying the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` from the constraints of type 1 and type 2, respectively. It also collects all the values that `k` must not be equal to (constraints of type 3). After determining the valid range for `k`, it subtracts the number of invalid values within this range to find the total number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the right answers for the given examples.
