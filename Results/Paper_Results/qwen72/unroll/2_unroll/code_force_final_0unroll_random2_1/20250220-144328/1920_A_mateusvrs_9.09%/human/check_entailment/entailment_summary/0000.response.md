Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case. It also reads the constraints `(a, x)` and processes them accordingly.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which is appropriate for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to some integer x).
   - `bx` is initialized to a very small number (`-1`), which is appropriate for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to some integer x).
   - `cx` is initialized as a set to store the constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to some integer x).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`a == 1`), the function updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`a == 2`), the function updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`a == 3`), the function adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that `cx` contains all the values that `k` must not be equal to.

4. **Range Calculation**:
   - The function checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, the function calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done by iterating over `cx` and counting the values that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where there are no valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` correctly by appending `0` to the result list.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 that fall within the valid range.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
