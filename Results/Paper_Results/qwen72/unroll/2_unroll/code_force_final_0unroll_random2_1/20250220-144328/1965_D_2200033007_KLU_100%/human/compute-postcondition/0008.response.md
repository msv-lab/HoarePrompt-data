Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements from the middle to the start of the list and their corresponding mirrored positions from the end of the list are set to half the difference between consecutive elements in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the middle element in `odds`. **
