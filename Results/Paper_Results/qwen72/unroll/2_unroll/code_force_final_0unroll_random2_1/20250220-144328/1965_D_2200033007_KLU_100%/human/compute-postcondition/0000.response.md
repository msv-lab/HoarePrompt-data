To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **`len(smallList) > 0`**: This condition requires that `smallList` is not empty. If `smallList` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `smallList` must contain at least one element.

2. **`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**: This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. If this condition is not met, the loop will not execute. Therefore, the last elements of both lists must be the same.

Given the initial state:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `smallList` must have at least one element.
- The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it is possible that `smallList` is empty, which would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, we need to ensure that `smallList` is not empty. Additionally, since `smallList` is a subsequence, the last element of `smallList` should already be in `bigList`, but we need to ensure that it is the last element of `bigList` as well.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, and `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
