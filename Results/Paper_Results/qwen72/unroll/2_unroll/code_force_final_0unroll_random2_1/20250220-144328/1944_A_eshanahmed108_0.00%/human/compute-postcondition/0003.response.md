Functionality: ** The function reads a series of inputs, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of islands and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each input pair, the function prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values for `n` and `k` are processed and the corresponding output is printed for each pair. **
