The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute based on the provided input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
