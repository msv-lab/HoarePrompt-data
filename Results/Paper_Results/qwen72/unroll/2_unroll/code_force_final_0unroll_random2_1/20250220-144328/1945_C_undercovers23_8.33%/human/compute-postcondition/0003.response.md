The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. Here, '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side, and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function should process these test cases and return the appropriate output for each case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the residents' preferences.**
