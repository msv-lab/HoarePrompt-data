Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The program uses a function `func_1` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `a` and then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The `func_1` function initializes a list `count` of length 7 to store the number of occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet.
3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The function iterates through the `count` list and checks if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it calculates the difference and adds it to `needed_problems`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of additional problems needed.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, correctly counting the occurrences and calculating the needed problems.

Correctness: **True**
