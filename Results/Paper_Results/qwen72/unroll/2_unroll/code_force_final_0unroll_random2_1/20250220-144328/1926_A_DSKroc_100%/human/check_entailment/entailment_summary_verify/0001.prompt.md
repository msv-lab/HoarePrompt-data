You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. If the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case to standard output. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled by converting the input to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is correct as it processes each test case.

3. **Initialize Counters**: Inside the loop, the program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to keep track of the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the current test case string.

4. **Read and Process Each String**: The program reads a string `s` of length 5 for each test case. It then iterates through each character in the string `s` and increments the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').

5. **Determine Most Frequent Character**: After processing the string, the program compares the two counters. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic is correct because it correctly identifies the most frequent character in the string.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the correct character for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

7. **Distinct Test Cases**: The problem statement mentions that all `t` strings in a test are different. The program does not explicitly check for this, but it is not necessary since the input is assumed to be valid and the program processes each string independently.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
