The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. Instead, it reads input from stdin. The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) on the first line, which represents the number of test cases. This is followed by `t` lines, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided test cases.
