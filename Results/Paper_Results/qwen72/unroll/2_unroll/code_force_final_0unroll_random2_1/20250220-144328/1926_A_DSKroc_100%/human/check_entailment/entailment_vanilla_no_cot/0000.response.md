Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic and the structure of the program align with the requirements of the problem, and it handles all the specified conditions correctly.
