Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, processes each string of length 5, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic is straightforward and handles all edge cases, including strings with equal counts of 'A' and 'B' (though the problem guarantees all strings are distinct, so this case is not applicable). The program works correctly for all provided examples and any other potential input within the constraints.
