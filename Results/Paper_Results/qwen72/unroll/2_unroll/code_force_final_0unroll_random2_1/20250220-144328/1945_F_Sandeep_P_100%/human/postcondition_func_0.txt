The function `func_1` accepts a string `fillvalue` and returns the `decorating_function`. It is intended to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of a `repr` function, such that it returns the specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. However, the function itself does not modify `fillvalue` or perform any actions beyond returning `decorating_function`.
