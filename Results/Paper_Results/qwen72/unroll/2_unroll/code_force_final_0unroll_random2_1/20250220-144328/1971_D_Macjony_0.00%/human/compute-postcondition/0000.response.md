The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The function `func` and the requirement that it processes a binary string `s` of length between 1 and 500 inclusive remain unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is now an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
