The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns the results for each test case.**
