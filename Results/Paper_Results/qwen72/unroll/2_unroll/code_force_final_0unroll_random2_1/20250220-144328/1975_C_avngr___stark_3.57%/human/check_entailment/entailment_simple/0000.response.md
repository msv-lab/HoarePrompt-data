Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum possible value of the number that all elements in the array can be changed to, using the given operations. The key insight is that the median of any subarray will always be an element of that subarray. Therefore, the maximum value that all elements can be changed to is the largest value that is not greater than its adjacent elements in the sorted array.

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `max` to 0, which will store the maximum value of the minimum pairs of consecutive elements.
4. It iterates through the array, comparing each pair of consecutive elements and updating `max` with the maximum value of the minimum of these pairs.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `max` for each test case.

The logic of the program is based on the observation that the maximum value that can be used to fill the entire array is the largest value among the minimum of consecutive pairs in the array. This is because, in the worst case, the median of any subarray will be the middle value of the sorted subarray, and the largest such value that can be used to fill the entire array is the one that is not greater than its adjacent elements.

Let's verify this with the given examples:
- For the array `[1, 2]`, the only consecutive pair is `(1, 2)`, and the minimum of this pair is `1`. Therefore, the maximum possible value is `1`.
- For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the consecutive pairs are `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(4, 5)`. The minimum values of these pairs are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, respectively. The maximum of these minimum values is `4`. Therefore, the maximum possible value is `4`.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
