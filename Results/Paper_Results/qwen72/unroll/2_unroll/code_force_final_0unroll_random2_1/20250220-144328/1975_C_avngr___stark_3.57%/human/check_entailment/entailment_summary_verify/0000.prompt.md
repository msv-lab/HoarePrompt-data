You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. For each test case, the function computes and prints the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` in an undefined state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply iterates through the array and finds the maximum of the minimum values of adjacent elements. However, this does not necessarily give the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into using the allowed operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 4 3 5
```
The correct output should be 4, as Mocha can perform the following operations:
1. Choose the interval (l, r) = (2, 4), then the median is 3, and the array becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 5].
2. Choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5), then the median is 3, and the array becomes [3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
3. Choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5), then the median is 3, and the array becomes [3, 3, 3, 3, 3].

However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The program fails to consider the possibility of transforming the array to a higher value by choosing different intervals and performing the operations as described.
