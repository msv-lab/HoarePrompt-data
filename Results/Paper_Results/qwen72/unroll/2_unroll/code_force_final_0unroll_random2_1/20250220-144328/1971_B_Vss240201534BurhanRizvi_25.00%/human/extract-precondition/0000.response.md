Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times for different test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, since the function definition does not match the problem description, the correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(s):
```

With the precondition being:

**s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**
