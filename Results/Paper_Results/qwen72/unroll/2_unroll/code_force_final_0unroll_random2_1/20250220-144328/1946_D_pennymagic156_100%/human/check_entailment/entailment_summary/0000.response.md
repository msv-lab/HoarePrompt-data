### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each with a different set of inputs.
   - `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n` and `x`, and returns them as integers.
   - `func_1` reads the second line of each test case, which contains the array `a`, and returns it as a list of integers.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - The function `func_5` processes each test case.
   - It initializes `t` as an empty list and `ans` as -1.
   - It iterates over the bits from the 29th to the 0th bit (since \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks the i-th bit of `x` and the sum of the i-th bits of the elements in `a`.
     - If the i-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If the i-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is even, it tries to partition `a` into segments where the i-th bit is 0, and appends the XOR of these segments to `t`.
     - If the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is even, it counts the number of segments where the i-th bit is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
     - If the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is 0, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for checking the i-th bit of `x` and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is sound.
- The function correctly partitions the array `a` and counts the segments where the bitwise OR of the XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.
- The function returns the correct result for each test case, either the maximum number of segments `k` or -1 if no such `k` exists.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and processes the array `a` to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
