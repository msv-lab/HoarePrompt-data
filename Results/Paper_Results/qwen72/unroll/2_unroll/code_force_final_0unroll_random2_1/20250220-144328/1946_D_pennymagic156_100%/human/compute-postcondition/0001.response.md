Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1()` to the variable `a`. Since `a` was initially described as a list of `n` integers where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, after the execution, `a` now holds a new list of integers as returned by `func_1()`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
