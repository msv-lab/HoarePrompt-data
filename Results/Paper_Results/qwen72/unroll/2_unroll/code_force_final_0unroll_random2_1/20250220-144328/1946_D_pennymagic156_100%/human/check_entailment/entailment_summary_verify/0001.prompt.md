You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It operates on an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, which are obtained internally through calls to `func_3` and `func_1`. The function modifies the list `a` and returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a specific bit pattern, encountered during the iterations where the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of the elements in `a` is even. The function does not change the values of `n` and `x`, but `a` is modified during the process.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle input. However, the main function `func_5` is the one that processes the actual problem.
   - `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n` and `x`.
   - `func_1` reads the second line of each test case, which contains the array `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 (`u == 0`).
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it returns `-1` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 (`u == 1`):
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even (`v % 2 == 0`), it continues to the next bit.
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0 and updates the answer.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is 0, it breaks the loop.

3. **Segment Splitting**:
   - The program uses a variable `op` to keep track of the XOR of the `i`-th bits of the current segment.
   - It uses `ai` to keep track of the cumulative XOR of the values in the current segment.
   - When `op` becomes 0, it means the current segment can be split, and it appends `ai` to the list `t` and resets `ai`.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - After processing all bits, the program returns the maximum value between the current `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input format.
- The logic for checking the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is sound.
- The segment splitting logic is correct, as it ensures that the XOR of each segment's `i`-th bits is 0 when `x`'s `i`-th bit is 0.
- The program correctly updates the answer and handles the case where no valid segments can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

### Correctness:
**True**
