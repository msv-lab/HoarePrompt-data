The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of items `n`, the number of items to select `k`, a list of item prices, and a list of item bonuses. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting `k` items, considering both their prices and bonuses. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and no variables are retained or returned.
