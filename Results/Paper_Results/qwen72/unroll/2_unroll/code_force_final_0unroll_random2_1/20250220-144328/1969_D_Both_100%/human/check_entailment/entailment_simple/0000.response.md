### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the list of Alice's item prices and Bob's item prices using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program converts Alice's item prices to negative values (`neg_prices`) to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap).
   - It pairs the negative prices with Bob's prices and sorts the combined list by Bob's prices in ascending order.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a heap with the first `k` items from the sorted list. This ensures that Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest Bob's prices (i.e., the least profitable for Alice).

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial profit using `func_3()`, which sums the profits of the remaining items that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the current profit by adding or removing items from the heap to maximize Alice's profit.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice's strategy is to choose items that maximize her profit, which is the sum of Bob's prices minus the sum of Alice's prices.
   - Bob's strategy is to minimize Alice's profit by taking the `k` items with the smallest Bob's prices.

6. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses `heapq.heappushpop()` to maintain the heap of size `k` and adjust the current profit accordingly.
   - The profit is updated by considering the difference between the item's profit and the profit of the item removed from the heap.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `heapq.heappushpop()`:**
  - The `heapq.heappushpop()` function returns the smallest element from the heap, which is already negative (since `neg_prices` are used). Therefore, the line `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` should actually be `current_profit += removed_item[0]` to correctly account for the profit change.
- **Incorrect Profit Calculation:**
  - The initial profit calculation in `func_3()` should be the sum of `b_i - a_i` for the items in `secondary_heap`, not `item[0] + item[1]`. The function `func_3()` is incorrectly summing the negative prices and bonuses.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import heapq
import sys

read_input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(read_input())

def func_2():
    return map(int, read_input().split())

def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum(-item[0] for item in secondary_heap)  # Corrected to sum b_i - a_i
    for item in primary_items:
        if -item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += -item[0] + item[1]
    return total

def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if -item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            current_profit += removed_item[0]  # Corrected to add the removed item's profit
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has issues with the profit calculation and the use of the heap. The corrected code addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
