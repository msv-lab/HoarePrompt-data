You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

The final output state will be the same as the initial state, except that `max_profit` will be printed for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of free items `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice `prices` and the prices for Bob `bonuses` using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `combined` by zipping `neg_prices` (negative of Alice's prices) and `bonuses` (Bob's prices).
   - This list is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order. This ensures that the items with the lowest Bob's prices are considered first, which is important for Bob's strategy to minimize Alice's profit.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap `heap` is initialized to store the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from `combined` into the heap. This ensures that Bob takes the items with the lowest Bob's prices for free.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial profit using `func_3()`, which sums the Bob's prices of the items in the heap and adds the profit from the remaining items.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining items in `combined` and updates the profit by:
     - Removing the item with the lowest Bob's price from the heap (since Bob will take it for free).
     - Adding the current item to the heap.
     - Adjusting the profit based on the changes in the heap and the current item.
   - The maximum profit is updated if the current profit is greater than the maximum profit.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Optimality:**
  - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - By sorting the items based on Bob's prices and using a heap to manage the `k` items Bob will take for free, the program ensures that Bob always takes the items with the lowest Bob's prices, which minimizes Alice's profit.
  - The program correctly calculates the profit for each possible subset of items and updates the maximum profit.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 (Bob takes no items for free) and where `k` is equal to `n` (Bob takes all items for free).
  - The program also handles the case where `n` is 0 (no items in the shop).

- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step and the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit when both Alice and Bob act optimally. The use of a heap and sorting ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
