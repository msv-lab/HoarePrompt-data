### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `num`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Reading Array Length and Elements:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2`.
   - It reads the array elements as a single line of input and splits it into a list of integers `a`.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program includes an edge case check: if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because:
     - The problem guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, so there is no need to break out of the loop.
     - The output of 16668 is not explained and does not match the problem requirements.

4. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted and stored in `b`.

5. **Determining the Median Index:**
   - The median index `ma` is calculated based on whether the length of the array is even or odd.
   - For even lengths, the median is the element at index `num2 // 2 - 1`.
   - For odd lengths, the median is the element at index `num2 // 2`.

6. **Increasing the Median:**
   - The program initializes `median` and `new_median` to the current median value.
   - It then enters a while loop that continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments the element at the median index `b[ma]` by 1, increments the operation counter `op` by 1, and sorts the array `b` again.
   - This approach is inefficient because it repeatedly sorts the array, which is unnecessary.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:** The edge case check is incorrect and unnecessary.
- **Inefficient Sorting:** The program sorts the array multiple times, which is inefficient and unnecessary.
- **Median Calculation:** The program should only increment the median element or the elements around it until the median is increased, rather than sorting the entire array repeatedly.

### Correct Approach:
- **Edge Case Handling:** Remove the incorrect edge case check.
- **Median Calculation:** Increment the median element or the elements around it until the median is increased.
- **Efficiency:** Avoid sorting the array multiple times. Instead, increment the necessary elements and check the new median.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
