The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0**
