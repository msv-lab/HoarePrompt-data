#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for `num` iterations, and for each iteration, it will read `num2` and `case` from the input. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print `1` and `16668` and break out of the loop. Otherwise, it will parse the list `a` from `case`, sort it, and then increment the middle element until the median increases, printing the number of operations required. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `num` test cases, and the variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `median` will have their final values based on the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `num` from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `num2` and a space-separated list of integers `case`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it parses the list `a` from `case`, sorts it, and increments the middle element until the median increases, printing the number of operations required. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the number of operations for each test case or the special values if `num2` exceeds 10000.
