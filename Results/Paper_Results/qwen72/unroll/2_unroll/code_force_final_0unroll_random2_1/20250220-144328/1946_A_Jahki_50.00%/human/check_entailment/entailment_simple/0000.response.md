### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is the length of the array and `a` is the array itself.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, but the current implementation does not define a function that can be called for each test case. Instead, it reads input directly within the function, which is not ideal for testing and reusability.

2. **Handling Large `num2`**:
   - The condition `if num2 > 10000` is incorrect and does not align with the problem description. The problem does not specify any special handling for large `num2` values, and the output `1` and `16668` is not explained or justified.

3. **Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is parsed correctly from the input string `case` using list comprehension.
   - The array `b` is sorted correctly, which is necessary to find the median.

4. **Finding the Median**:
   - The median index `ma` is calculated correctly for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - The median is correctly identified as `b[ma]`.

5. **Incrementing the Median**:
   - The loop `while new_median <= median` is intended to increment the middle element until the median increases. However, this approach is inefficient and incorrect.
   - The median should be increased by incrementing the smallest element that is less than or equal to the current median, not just the middle element. This is because the median is the middle value in the sorted array, and increasing the middle element directly may not always result in the minimum number of operations.

6. **Output**:
   - The number of operations `op` is printed correctly, but the logic to determine the minimum number of operations is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because:
- It does not handle multiple test cases properly.
- It has an incorrect condition for large `num2` values.
- The logic to increment the median is inefficient and does not always produce the minimum number of operations.
