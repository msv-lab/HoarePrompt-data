Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), and it should generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern as described in the problem statement. The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to handle specific values of \( n \) (1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints the corresponding checkerboard pattern. However, the program does not handle the general case for any \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20). Instead, it only prints the patterns for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \), and for any other value of \( n \), it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish).

This approach is incorrect because:
1. The program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), not just for specific values.
2. The program does not handle the general case, which is a requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
