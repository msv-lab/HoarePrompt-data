You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `casos` from the input, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern to the console. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the checkerboard patterns or the out-of-range message for each test case have been printed to the console. The variable `casos` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer read during the last iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `casos`, and then iterates through each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the program prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells being `#`.
   - For `n = 2`, the program prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##`.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##`, `..##..`, and `##..##`.
   - For `n = 4`, the program prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..`, `..##..##`, and `##..##..`.

3. **Pattern Consistency**:
   - The pattern for `n = 1` is correct: `##`.
   - The pattern for `n = 2` is correct: `##..` and `..##`.
   - The pattern for `n = 3` is correct: `##..##`, `..##..`, and `##..##`.
   - The pattern for `n = 4` is correct: `##..##..`, `..##..##`, and `##..##..`.

4. **Handling Out-of-Range Values**:
   - The program correctly handles values of `n` that are not within the specified range (1 to 4) by printing "No esta en el rango". However, the problem description states that `1 \leq n \leq 20`, so this part of the program is incorrect because it should handle all values within this range, not just 1 to 4.

5. **Generalization**:
   - The program does not generalize for values of `n` greater than 4. It should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` within the range 1 to 20, but it only has hardcoded patterns for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly outputs the checkerboard without spaces and ensures that each test case's output is separated by the input of the next test case.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid values of `n` (1 to 20) and only provides hardcoded solutions for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

Correctness: **False**
