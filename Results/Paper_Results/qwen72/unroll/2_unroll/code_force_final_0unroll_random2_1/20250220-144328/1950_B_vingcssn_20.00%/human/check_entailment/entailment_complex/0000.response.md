Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and print a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern. However, the program only correctly handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n`, it prints 'No esta en el rango', which is not the expected behavior according to the problem description. The problem requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` within the range 1 to 20, not just for the specific values 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Additionally, the program does not follow a general approach to generate the checkerboard pattern for any `n`, but instead uses hard-coded print statements for specific values of `n`. This makes the program inflexible and incorrect for values of `n` other than 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Correctness: **False**
