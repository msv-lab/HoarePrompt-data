### Reasoning

The original assessment points out a critical flaw in the program: it does not handle the case where the elements in the array `b` are not unique. According to the problem description, the elements of the progressive square should be unique, but the program does not check for this. If there are duplicate elements in the array `b`, the program will still consider it as a valid progressive square, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the function `func_1` and analyze its behavior:

1. **Finding the Minimum Element**:
   - The function correctly finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l` using `a = min(l)`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The function generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` integers, where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for `0 <= k < n` and `0 <= h < n`.
   - This part of the function is correct in terms of generating the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function then checks if the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`.

4. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - The function does not explicitly check for duplicates in the list `l`.
   - If `l` contains duplicates, the sorted `l` will still be compared to `li`, which is generated to have unique elements. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Analysis

Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8 8
```
- The minimum element `a` in `l` is `1`.
- The generated list `li` based on `a = 1`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3` will be:
  ```
  [1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5, 8, 11]
  ```
- The input list `l` after sorting will be:
  ```
  [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10]
  ```
- The comparison `l == li` will fail because `l` contains a duplicate `8`, which is not in `li`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in the array `b` are not unique, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
