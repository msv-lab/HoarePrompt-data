Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The function generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` integers, where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k < n and 0 <= h < n, with `a` being the smallest integer in `l`. It then sorts both `l` and `li`. If the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. **
