### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
   - It adds each `f` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (i.e., \(\binom{n}{2}\)).
   - This is done using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
     - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
     - `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` and prints it.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correct.
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen is the sum of the initial friendship values multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends, plus the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions is \(\frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{n(n-1)}\).
  - Combining these, the expected value is \(\frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}\).

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the constraints.
  - The use of `pow(q, -1, M)` to compute the modular inverse is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (i.e., `m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0 in this case.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
