### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's formula for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning and the correct approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for \( k \) excursions.
   - For each excursion, the teacher randomly picks a pair of children.
   - If the pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends, weighted by the probability of each pair being chosen.

2. **Correct Formula:**
   - The total number of possible pairs is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values for each excursion is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value per Excursion} = \frac{m \cdot (\text{sum\_f} + k - 1)}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - This is because each pair of friends has a probability of \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) of being chosen, and their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

3. **Summing Over All Excursions:**
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values over \( k \) excursions is:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = k \cdot \left( \frac{m \cdot (\text{sum\_f} + k - 1)}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]

4. **Program's Formula:**
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - This formula does not correctly account for the expected value calculation. It seems to be an incorrect combination of terms that does not reflect the correct probability and value contributions.

5. **Example Case:**
   - For the test case:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - The program calculates:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18
     \]
     \[
     \text{Result} = 14 \cdot 18^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The correct expected value should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value per Excursion} = \frac{1 \cdot (1 + 2 - 1)}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
     \]
   - The program's output does not match this correct expected value.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program's formula for calculating the expected value is incorrect, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
