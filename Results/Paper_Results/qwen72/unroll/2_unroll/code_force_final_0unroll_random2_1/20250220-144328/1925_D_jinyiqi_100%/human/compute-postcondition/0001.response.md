The provided code snippet only declares a constant `M` and assigns it the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This constant is typically used for taking results modulo a large prime number, which is common in problems involving large numbers to prevent integer overflow and to keep the numbers manageable.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the number of children (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (0 ≤ `m` ≤ min(10^5, `n`(`n`-1)/2)), and `k` is the number of excursions (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 × 10^5). Additionally, `m` lines follow, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends (1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, `a_i` ≠ `b_i`) and their initial friendship value (1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function should return an integer for each test case, which is the answer to the problem modulo (10^9 + 7). `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `M` is 1000000007.**
