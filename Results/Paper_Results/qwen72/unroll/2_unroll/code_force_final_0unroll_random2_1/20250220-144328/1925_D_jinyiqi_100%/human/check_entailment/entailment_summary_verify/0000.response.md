### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why the original assessment is correct and the program is indeed incorrect.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of friendship data: `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values for all k excursions is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \cdot \left( \frac{m \cdot (\text{sum\_f} + k - 1)}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the incremental increases over the k excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided calculates the expected value using the following formula:
\[
p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
\]
\[
q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
\]

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of initial friendship values, `sum_f`, by iterating over the `m` pairs of friends.

2. **Total Number of Pairs:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs, `cn2`, using \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program's formula for `p` and `q` is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - This formula does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \cdot \left( \frac{m \cdot (\text{sum\_f} + k - 1)}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - The program's formula overcomplicates the calculation and does not account for the correct expected value.

#### Example Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- The only pair of friends is (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.

The total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).

For the first excursion, the probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is \(\frac{1}{3}\). If chosen, the friendship value becomes 2. For the second excursion, the probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is still \(\frac{1}{3}\), and if chosen, the friendship value becomes 3.

The expected value for the sum of friendship values for the two excursions is:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1 \cdot (1 + 2 - 1)}{3} \right) = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3}
\]

The program's output for this case is:
\[
p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14
\]
\[
q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18
\]
\[
\text{Result} = 14 \cdot 18^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)
\]

This is clearly incorrect and does not match the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
