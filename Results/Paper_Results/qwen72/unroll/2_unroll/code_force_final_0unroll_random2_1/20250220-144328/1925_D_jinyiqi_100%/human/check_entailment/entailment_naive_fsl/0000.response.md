Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions is incorrect.

### Issue:
The program calculates the expected value using the formula:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

However, this formula does not correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = k \cdot \left( \frac{m \cdot (\text{sum\_f} + k - 1)}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- The only pair of friends is (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.

The total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).

For the first excursion, the probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is \(\frac{1}{3}\). If chosen, the friendship value becomes 2. For the second excursion, the probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is still \(\frac{1}{3}\), and if chosen, the friendship value becomes 3.

The expected value for the sum of friendship values for the two excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1 \cdot (1 + 2 - 1)}{3} \right) = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \]

The program's output for this case is:
\[ p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14 \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18 \]
\[ \text{Result} = 14 \cdot 18^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \]

This is clearly incorrect and does not match the expected value calculation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
