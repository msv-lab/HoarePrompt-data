The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function operates with two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The specific return value or output is not provided.**
