Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first `k` indices are filled with the values from `1` to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `k + 1`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `permutation`**:
   - The list `permutation` has `n` elements.
   - The first `k` elements are filled with the values from `1` to `k` in a repeating pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the `permutation` list would look like: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]`.

2. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a string that contains the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.
   - For the example above, `result` would be: `"1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1"`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the string `result`.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **"1 2 3 ... 1 2 3" (where the pattern "1 2 3" repeats every `k` elements, and the total number of elements is `n`)**
