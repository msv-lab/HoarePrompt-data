You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string. The order of characters in both lists is the same as their order in the `password` string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop completes without returning `False`, and the `digits` and `letters` lists remain unchanged.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists to check if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Checking Digits:**
   - The program iterates through the `digits` list to ensure that each digit is less than or equal to the next digit. If any digit is greater than the next, it returns `False`.

4. **Checking Digits After Letters:**
   - The program checks if any digit in the `digits` list comes after any letter in the `letters` list. If any digit is greater than any letter, it returns `False`.

5. **Reconstructing and Comparing:**
   - The program reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then compares the reconstructed password with the original password. If they are the same, the password is strong and it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:

1. **Checking Digits After Letters:**
   - The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It should check if any digit comes after any letter, not just the last digit.
   - The correct approach would be to ensure that all digits come before any letters in the password.

2. **Combining and Comparing:**
   - The program correctly combines the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares the result with the original password.
   - However, the comparison should be done after ensuring that all digits come before any letters.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if all digits come before any letters
    if digits and letters and digits[-1] > letters[0]:
        return False
    
    # Reconstruct the password and compare
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

### Final Correctness:

- The original program has a logical error in checking if any digit comes after any letter.
- The corrected function ensures that all digits are sorted, all letters are sorted, and all digits come before any letters.

### Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in checking the order of digits and letters. The corrected function should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
