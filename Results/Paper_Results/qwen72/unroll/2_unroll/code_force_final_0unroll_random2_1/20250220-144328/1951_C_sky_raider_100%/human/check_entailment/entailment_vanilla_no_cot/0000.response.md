Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Reading and Looping Through Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Reading and Sorting Ticket Prices**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum tickets per day `m`, and the total tickets to buy `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `l` and sorts it in ascending order. Sorting ensures that we always consider the cheapest available tickets first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 0, which keeps track of the total number of tickets already purchased.
   - It also initializes `s` to 0, which will store the number of tickets to buy on the current day.
   - It initializes `c` to 0, which will store the cumulative cost of tickets.
   - The program iterates through each day, and for each day:
     - It sets `s` to the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on that day) and `k` (the remaining tickets to buy).
     - It adds the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day to `c`. The cost is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price per ticket on the current day, and `t` is the total number of tickets already purchased, which increases the price of subsequent tickets.
     - It updates `t` by adding `s` to it, and decreases `k` by `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days, the program prints the total cost `c` for the current test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner by always choosing the cheapest available tickets first and accounting for the price increase due to previous purchases. Therefore, the program is correct.
