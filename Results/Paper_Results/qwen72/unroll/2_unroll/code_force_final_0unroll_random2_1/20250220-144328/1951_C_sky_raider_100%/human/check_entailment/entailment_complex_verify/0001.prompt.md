You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: For each test case, the variable `c` will hold the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, and `k` will be 0 (indicating all tickets have been bought). The variables `n`, `m`, and `l` will retain their initial values for the next test case, and `t` will be equal to the total number of tickets bought in the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices for each day. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing each test case, the function resets the state for the next test case, leaving the input variables `n`, `m`, and `a` unchanged, while `k` is reduced to 0 and `t` holds the total number of tickets bought in the current test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. 
   - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
   - `s` is the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day.
   - `c` is the cumulative cost of the tickets purchased.

4. **Loop Through Days**:
   - The program iterates through each day, from the cheapest to the most expensive.
   - For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy `s` as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - It then adds the cost of these tickets to the cumulative cost `c`. The cost is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on the current day and `t` is the total number of tickets already purchased, which affects the price increase.
   - The total number of tickets purchased `t` is incremented by `s`.
   - The remaining tickets needed `k` is decremented by `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all days, the program prints the cumulative cost `c` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The sorting step ensures that the program always buys the cheapest available tickets first, which is optimal.
- The loop correctly handles the constraints of buying no more than `m` tickets per day and the price increase for subsequent days.
- The program correctly updates the cumulative cost and the remaining tickets needed.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` becomes 0 before the loop ends. However, this is not a problem because the loop will naturally terminate when `k` reaches 0, and the remaining days will not affect the total cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and ensures the minimum cost is achieved by always buying the cheapest tickets first.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.
