### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is activated.
   - Players alternate moves, moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The tree is reset to all inactive nodes after each round.

2. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`), where each node points to its neighbors.
   - The tree is constructed by reading the edges from the input.

3. **Identifying Leaves:**
   - Leaves are nodes with only one neighbor.
   - The `leaves` deque is initialized with all nodes that have only one neighbor.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine if the first player (Ron) can force a win starting from a given node.
   - The function recursively checks if there is any neighbor from which the second player (Hermione) cannot force a win.
   - If there is at least one such neighbor, Ron can force a win by moving to that neighbor.
   - If all neighbors allow Hermione to force a win, Ron cannot force a win.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is read correctly, with `n` and `t` (which is always 1) being the first line.
   - The edges are read and used to build the tree.
   - The starting node for the round is read.
   - The result of `func_1` is used to determine the winner and print "Ron" or "Hermione" accordingly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the starting node is not a leaf node correctly by recursively checking its neighbors.

7. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players are assumed to play optimally.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly models the optimal play by checking all possible moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles the input and output correctly, and the recursive function `func_1` accurately models the game's optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
