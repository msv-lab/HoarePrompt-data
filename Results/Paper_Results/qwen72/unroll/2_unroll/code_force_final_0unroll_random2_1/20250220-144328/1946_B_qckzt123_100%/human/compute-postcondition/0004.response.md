The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `k`: an integer where 1 <= k <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing a specific parameter.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9, representing the input list.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the inputs. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only infer the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
