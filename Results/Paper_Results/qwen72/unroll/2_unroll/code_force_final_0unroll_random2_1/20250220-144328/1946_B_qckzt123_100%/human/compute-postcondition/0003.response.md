Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is an integer read from the input and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. After the loop, `ans` is the final computed value for each test case, and `t` is the maximum subarray sum found in the last iteration of the inner loop for each test case, modulo `MOD`.**
