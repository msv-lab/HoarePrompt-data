### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The function iterates over each test case using a loop `for t in range(T)`.

3. **Calculation of `suma`:**
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0.
   - The function then iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` using the loop `for i in range(1, b + 1)`.
   - Inside this loop, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints `suma - 1`.

### Analysis of the Calculation:

- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- However, the formula and the logic used to count the pairs are not aligned with the problem statement.

### Specific Example:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- For `a = 2` and `b = 3`, the valid pairs are:
  - (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

- The program should output 3, but it outputs 2. This indicates that the logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis of the Flawed Logic:

- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not derived from the problem statement. It seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but it does not correctly handle the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is also not aligned with the problem statement. It does not ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
- For each pair, check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the condition where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not count the valid pairs correctly.

Final: **False**
