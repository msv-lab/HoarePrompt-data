The function `func` is described with no parameters explicitly listed in the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified in the given context, so we cannot determine what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The specific return value or behavior of the function based on these parameters is not provided.**
