### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are expected to be within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 2 \times 10^6\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The commented-out code suggests a brute-force approach to check all pairs \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i \le a\) and \(1 \le j \le b\). However, this approach is inefficient and not used in the final solution.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - The program uses a more efficient approach to calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over all possible values of \(b\) (denoted as `i` in the loop) from 1 to `b`.
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The idea is to find how many \(a\) values satisfy this condition for a given \(b\).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program sums up the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\) and stores this in `suma`.
   - It then prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The subtraction of 1 is necessary because the formula might count an extra pair that doesn't satisfy the condition.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) \le 0\) by not adding to `suma` in such cases.
   - The program correctly processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used is derived from the problem statement and the program handles the input and output as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.
