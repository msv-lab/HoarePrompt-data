### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Flawed Logic:**
   - The program contains a commented-out section that attempts to iterate over pairs \((i, j)\) and check the condition, but it is not used.
   - The actual logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs is:
     ```python
     suma = 0
     for i in range(1, b + 1):
         x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
         if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
             suma += x
     print(suma - 1)
     ```

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It calculates a value `suma` and prints `suma - 1`.
   - The function does not use the variables `n` and `m` directly but uses `a` and `b` which are read from the input.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is incorrect. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the program.
   - The program seems to be attempting a different approach, but it does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are:
     - (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
     - (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
     - (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
   - The expected output is 3, but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the condition where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not count the valid pairs correctly.

Final: **False**
