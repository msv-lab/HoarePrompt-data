The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: an integer representing the number of distinct types of cards, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `k`: an integer representing the number of coins, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` represents the number of cards of type `i`, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.

The function returns the result of each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided output. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function returns a value or a list of values that depend on the number of cards and coins for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type. It returns a result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined but likely depends on the number of cards and coins.**
