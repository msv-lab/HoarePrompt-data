### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from input, and then reads a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Sorting is necessary to efficiently determine the minimum number of cards required to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Initial Variables:**
   - `r` is initialized to the smallest number of cards of any type (`a[0]`).
   - `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0.
   - These initializations are appropriate for the logic that follows.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-2` (i.e., `n-1` times).
   - It checks if the cost to make all elements up to `a[i+1]` equal is greater than the remaining coins `k`.
   - If the cost is greater, it calculates the maximum number of cards `r` that can be made equal using the remaining coins and sets `rem` to the remainder of the coins.
   - It also sets `y` to the number of elements that were not processed due to the break condition.
   - If the cost is not greater, it updates `k` by subtracting the cost and sets `r` to the current `a[i+1]`.

5. **Final Computation:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is not 0, it calculates `r` as the maximum number of cards that can be made equal using the remaining coins and prints the result.
   - If `k` is 0, it prints the result based on the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The output is a single integer for each test case, which is the maximum score that can be achieved.
   - The formula used to compute the result is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` if the loop breaks, and `(r - 1) * n + 1` otherwise.
   - This formula is derived from the logic of forming the maximum number of permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` by buying additional cards.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum score for each test case based on the given problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the algorithm used to compute the result is logically sound and follows the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
