You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        r = a[0]
        
        rem = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output state consists of the value of `r` and `rem` being the final computed values, and `y` being the number of elements in `a` that were not processed due to the break condition. The variable `k` is set to 0 if the loop breaks, otherwise it is the remaining value after the loop completes. The loop prints the calculated result for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the initial `k` for each test case are unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type. It returns a result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined but likely depends on the number of cards and coins.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
