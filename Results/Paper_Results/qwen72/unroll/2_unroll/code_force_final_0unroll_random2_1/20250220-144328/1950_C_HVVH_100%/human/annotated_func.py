#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is the hour from 00 to 23 and "mm" is the minute from 00 to 59. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: The function will print the time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' for each iteration of the loop, based on the input time and the value of `day`. The variables `h`, `m`, and `day` will be updated for each iteration, but the initial state of `s`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged. The final values of `h`, `m`, and `day` will depend on the last input time and the number of iterations `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 1440). For each test case, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is the hour (00 to 23) and "mm" is the minute (00 to 59). The function converts each time to a 12-hour format and prints it followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the converted times have been printed. The initial state of the program, including the value of `n`, remains unchanged.
