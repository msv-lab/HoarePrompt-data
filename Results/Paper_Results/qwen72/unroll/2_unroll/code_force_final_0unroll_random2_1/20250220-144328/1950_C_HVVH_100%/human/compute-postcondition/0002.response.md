To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state before the loop (such as `s`, `t`, and `day`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
