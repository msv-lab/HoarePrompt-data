Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 1440). For each test case, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is the hour (00 to 23) and "mm" is the minute (00 to 59). The function converts each time to a 12-hour format and prints it followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the converted times have been printed. The initial state of the program, including the value of `n`, remains unchanged. **
