Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then processes these inputs to compute a series of values, ultimately printing the maximum value from this series for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their values as they were at the end of the last iteration of the loop. **
