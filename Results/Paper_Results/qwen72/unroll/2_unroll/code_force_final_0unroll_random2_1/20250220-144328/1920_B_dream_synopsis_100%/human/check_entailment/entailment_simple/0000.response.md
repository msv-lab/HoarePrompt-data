Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order and then reversed to be in descending order. This is done to ensure that Alice can remove the smallest elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated correctly.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice's strategy is to remove the smallest `i` elements (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k`), and Bob's strategy is to multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1.
   - The function iterates over all possible values of `i` (from 0 to `k`), and for each `i`, it calculates the sum after Alice removes `i` elements and Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1.
   - The calculation `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` is correct for the case where Alice removes 0 elements. This is because Bob will multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1, effectively subtracting twice their sum from the total sum.
   - For `i > 0`, the function updates the sum by adding back the `i-1`-th element (which was previously removed) and subtracting twice the `i+x-1`-th element (which Bob will multiply by -1). This is a correct approach to simulate the removal and negation of elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `i + x - 1` is out of bounds by simply adding back the `i-1`-th element without subtracting any additional elements. This is correct because if `i + x - 1` is out of bounds, it means Bob cannot multiply any more elements by -1.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which is the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
