### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order using `a.sort()` followed by `a.reverse()`. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the array, which is a good strategy for Alice to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the initial sum of the array `sum1 = sum(a)`.

4. **Generating Possible Sums:**
   - The function iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove, from 0 to `k`.
   - For each possible number of removed elements `i`:
     - If `i` is 0, it calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1.
     - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of Alice removing `i` elements and Bob multiplying the next `x` elements by -1.
     - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of Alice removing `i` elements and Bob not being able to multiply any more elements by -1.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The sorting and reversing of the array ensure that the smallest elements are at the end, and the loop considers removing elements from the end.

- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - Bob should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The initial sum calculation and the subsequent adjustments in the loop correctly account for this.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where `k` or `x` are 0 or equal to `n`.
  - The function also correctly handles the case where `i + x - 1` exceeds `n`, ensuring that Bob cannot multiply more elements than are available.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice and Bob's optimal strategies and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the function processes multiple test cases and retains the necessary variables correctly.
