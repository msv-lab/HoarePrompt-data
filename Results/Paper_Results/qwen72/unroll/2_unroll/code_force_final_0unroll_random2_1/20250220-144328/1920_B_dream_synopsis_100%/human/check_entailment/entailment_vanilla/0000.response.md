### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because Alice wants to maximize the sum, and removing the smallest elements (after sorting in descending order) will help achieve this goal.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a list `ans` to store the possible sums after Alice and Bob have played their turns.
   - It iterates over the number of elements Alice can remove, from 0 to `k`.

5. **Sum Calculation for Each Case**:
   - For each `i` (number of elements Alice removes):
     - If `i == 0`, it calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from `sum1`.
     - For `i > 0`, it updates the sum by adding the element that Alice removes and subtracting twice the element that Bob multiplies by -1. This is done to account for the changes in the array after each removal and multiplication.
     - If `i + x - 1` is out of bounds, it simply adds the element that Alice removes.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their turns.

### Analysis:
- **Alice's Strategy**: By removing the smallest elements, Alice maximizes the sum of the remaining elements.
- **Bob's Strategy**: By multiplying the largest remaining elements by -1, Bob minimizes the sum of the array.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `k` is 0, Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob can only multiply the first `x` elements by -1.
  - When `k` is equal to `n`, Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
  - When `x` is 0, Bob does not multiply any elements by -1, and the sum is simply the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for both Alice and Bob's optimal strategies. It handles the edge cases and the general case well, ensuring that the sum is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.
