The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it interacts with an environment that provides multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to the environment to find indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` from a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. It returns these indices after making at most 3n queries to the environment.**
