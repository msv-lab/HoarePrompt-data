Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly follow the problem description and constraints for finding the maximum XOR of any two indices in a permutation using at most 3n queries. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it compares `p[v1] | p[v1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` using a query.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` is the index of the element with the maximum OR value with itself.

3. **Finding the Second Index**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates through the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it compares `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]` using a query.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` is the index of the element that, when ORed with `p[v1]`, gives a value greater than or equal to any other element ORed with `p[v1]`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - After finding the two indices `prev` and `v1`, the program prints the result in the required format `! {prev} {v1}`.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes at most `n-1` queries to find `v1` and another `n-1` queries to find `prev`, totaling `2n-2` queries, which is within the limit of `3n`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly, as it will make only one query to find `v1` and another to find `prev`, which is within the limit of `3n = 6`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases and constraints correctly, making it a correct solution.
