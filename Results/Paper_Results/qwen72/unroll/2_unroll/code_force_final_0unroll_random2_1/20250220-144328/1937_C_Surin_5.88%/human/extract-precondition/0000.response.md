Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through queries and responses. The input includes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
