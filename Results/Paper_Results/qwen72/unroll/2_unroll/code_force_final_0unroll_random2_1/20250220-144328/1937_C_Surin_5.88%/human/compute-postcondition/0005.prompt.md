You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through queries and responses. The input includes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The loop will execute `kp` times, where `kp` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the loop will find the maximum value `prev` and the value `v1` which is the largest number less than `n` such that all pairs `(v1, i)` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1` satisfy the condition `v1 > i`. The final output for each test case will be `! {prev} {v1}`, where `prev` is the largest value less than `v1` that satisfies the condition `v1 > i`. After all iterations, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will be reset for each new test case, but the number of test cases `kp` will be exhausted.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` from a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. It returns these indices after making at most 3n queries to the environment.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
