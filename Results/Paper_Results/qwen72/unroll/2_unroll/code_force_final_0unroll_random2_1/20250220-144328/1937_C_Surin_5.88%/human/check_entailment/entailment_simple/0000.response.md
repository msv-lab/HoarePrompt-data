### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The bitwise OR operation \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) is used to indirectly compare the values of \( p_i \) and \( p_j \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and initializes variables \( g \) and \( v1 \).
   - The first loop (from 1 to \( n \)) is used to find the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the largest value in the permutation. This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \). If \( p_i \) is larger, \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).
   - The second loop (from 1 to \( n \)) is used to find the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \) is the largest value less than \( p_{v1} \) that maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \). This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \). If \( p_i \) is larger, \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the largest value in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \) is the largest value less than \( p_{v1} \) that maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \).
   - The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \( 3n \) by using two loops, each running \( n-1 \) times, which totals \( 2n-2 \) queries, well within the limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the two indices 0 and 1, and the maximum XOR will be 1.
   - The program also handles the case where \( n \) is larger, ensuring that the maximum XOR is found by comparing the largest value with all other values.

5. **Interactive Constraints:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and answer, ensuring that the interactive environment can process the input and output correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and adheres to the problem constraints. It correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
