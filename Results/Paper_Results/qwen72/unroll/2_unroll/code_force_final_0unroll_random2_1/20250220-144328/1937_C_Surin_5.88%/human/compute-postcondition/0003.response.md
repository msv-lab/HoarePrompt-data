Output State: **The loop will execute `kp` times, where `kp` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the loop will find the maximum value `prev` and the value `v1` which is the largest number less than `n` such that all pairs `(v1, i)` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1` satisfy the condition `v1 > i`. The final output for each test case will be `! {prev} {v1}`, where `prev` is the largest value less than `v1` that satisfies the condition `v1 > i`. After all iterations, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will be reset for each new test case, but the number of test cases `kp` will be exhausted.**
