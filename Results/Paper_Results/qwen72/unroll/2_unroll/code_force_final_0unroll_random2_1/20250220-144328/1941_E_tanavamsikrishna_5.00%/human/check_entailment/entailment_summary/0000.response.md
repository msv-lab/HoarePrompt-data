**Reasoning:**

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row of the river.
   - It increments the cost of the first `d-1` elements by 1, which is correct because these are the initial supports that must be installed.
   - For the rest of the elements, it sets the cost to the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus 1. This is intended to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d-1` (since the distance is defined as `|j1 - j2| - 1`).
   - However, the function returns `row[-1]`, which is always 0 (since the last element of the row is 0). This is incorrect because the function should return the total cost of installing the supports in the row, not the last element of the row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs and prints the minimum of these sums.
   - Since `func_1` is returning 0 for each row, the total cost calculated by `func_2` will always be 0, which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
The program is incorrect because `func_1` is not returning the correct cost for building a bridge on a single row. The function should return the total cost of installing the supports in the row, but it is returning 0 instead. This causes `func_2` to always print 0, which is not the correct solution for the problem.

**Correctness: **False**
