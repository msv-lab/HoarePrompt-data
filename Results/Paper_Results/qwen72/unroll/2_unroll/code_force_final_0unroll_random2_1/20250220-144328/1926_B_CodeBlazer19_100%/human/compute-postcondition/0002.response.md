Output State: **The function will print 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each iteration of the loop based on the input grid. The variables `a` and `b` will be reset to their initial values (`a = 0` and `b = ''`) at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be `0` and `''` respectively, and the variable `t` will remain unchanged.**
