Reasoning:

The problem description requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The provided functions, however, do not align with this problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function is designed to process a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. However, the problem description specifies that the input is a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to count the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.
   - The function returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`, which again does not correspond to the year calculation required by the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes it to extract the number of test cases and the periodicities of the signs.
   - However, it incorrectly treats the periodicities as a single string (`path`), which should be a list of integers.
   - It calls `func_1` with a single string, which is not the correct input format for `func_1` as described in its problem context.
   - The function collects and prints the results of `func_1`, but since `func_1` is not solving the correct problem, the results will be incorrect.

Given these points, the provided functions do not solve the problem as described. The functions are designed to solve a different problem, one that involves counting '@' signs and handling '*' penalties, which is not the same as calculating the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

Correctness: **False**
