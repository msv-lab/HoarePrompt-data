You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

If an element in `path` is '*', the corresponding element in `dp` is `-inf`. If an element in `path` is '@', the corresponding element in `dp` is the maximum value of the previous two elements in `dp` plus 1.

    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity, and the length of `path` is at least 2. It returns the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected while traversing the `path`, with the constraint that encountering a '*' sign results in an immediate penalty represented by `-inf`. If the `path` is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the highest value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`, which represents the optimal number of '@' signs that can be collected under the given constraints.

    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list remains unchanged, and all elements in `results` are printed to the console. The variables `data`, `t`, and `index` remain the same as in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input (stdin), processes it to extract a series of paths, and then applies the function `func_1` to each path. The results of these function calls are collected into a list and printed to the console, one result per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `results` list contains the output of `func_1` for each path, and the variables `data`, `t`, and `index` are in the same state as described in the final annotation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description requires a function to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) is designed to solve a completely different problem. It appears to be a dynamic programming solution for a path traversal problem where `@` and `*` are used to represent different states or obstacles. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
