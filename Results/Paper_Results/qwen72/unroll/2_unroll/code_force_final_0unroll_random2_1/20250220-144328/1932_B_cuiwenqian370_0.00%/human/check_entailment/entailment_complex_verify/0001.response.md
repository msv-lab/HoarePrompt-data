### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in a specific sequence.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a path string, which is not related to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected while avoiding '*' characters.
   - This function is entirely unrelated to the problem statement and does not solve the given problem.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with a string that is not the list of periodicities but a single string.
   - The function `func_1` is not designed to handle the list of periodicities and will not produce the correct output for the problem.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` is processing a path string and not a list of periodicities, and `func_2` is calling `func_1` with a single string rather than a list of integers.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur. The functions are designed for a different problem and will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Final: **False**
