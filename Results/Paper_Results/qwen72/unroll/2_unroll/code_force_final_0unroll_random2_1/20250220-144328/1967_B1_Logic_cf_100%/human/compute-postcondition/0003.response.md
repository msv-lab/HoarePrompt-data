The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases and is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns different values based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are positive integers for each test case. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
