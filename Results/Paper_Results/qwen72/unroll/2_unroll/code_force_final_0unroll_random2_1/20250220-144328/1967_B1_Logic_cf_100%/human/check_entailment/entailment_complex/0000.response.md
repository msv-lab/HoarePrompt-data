Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and converts them to integers.

2. **Initial Value of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is correct because for `b = 1`, the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is always true, and there are `n` such pairs `(a, 1)` where `1 <= a <= n`.

3. **Loop for Calculating `ans`**: The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is correct because `b` must be at least 2 and at most the minimum of `n` and `m` to satisfy the conditions.

4. **Expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`**: The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `b`. However, this expression is incorrect. The correct expression should be based on the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. 

   - The correct approach would be to count the number of `a` values for each `b` such that `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. This can be simplified by noting that `gcd(a, b)` must divide `a`, and thus `a` can be written as `k * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`. The condition then becomes `(k * gcd(a, b) + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`, which simplifies to `b % gcd(a, b) == 0`. This means `b` must be a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`, and `a` can be any multiple of `gcd(a, b)` up to `n`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the calculated value of `ans` for each test case, which is correct in terms of the output format.

Given the incorrect expression used in the loop, the program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Correctness: **False**
