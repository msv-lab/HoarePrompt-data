The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The function calculates a value `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all integers `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The calculated value `ans` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the values of `n` and `m` from the last test case, and the last calculated value of `ans` is printed.
