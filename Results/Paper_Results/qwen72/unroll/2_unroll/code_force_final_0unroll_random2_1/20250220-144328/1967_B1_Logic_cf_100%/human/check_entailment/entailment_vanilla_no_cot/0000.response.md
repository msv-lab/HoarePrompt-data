Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.

1. **Initial Value of `ans`**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs is not necessarily equal to `n` initially.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - The calculation `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), counting the number of \(a\) values that satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, as we start with no valid pairs.

2. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - The inner loop iterates over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), the program checks if \((a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, the pair is valid, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Output**:
   - After checking all pairs for the current test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

This corrected program will correctly count the number of valid pairs for each test case. However, it may not be efficient enough for the given constraints (up to \(10^4\) test cases and \(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). For better performance, you might need to optimize the solution, but the logic in the provided program is fundamentally incorrect.
