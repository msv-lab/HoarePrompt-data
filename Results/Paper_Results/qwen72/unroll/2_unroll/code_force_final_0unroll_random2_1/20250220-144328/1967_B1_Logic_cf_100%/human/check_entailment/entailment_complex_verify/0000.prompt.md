You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and for each iteration, the variables `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided for that iteration. The variable `ans` will be calculated and printed for each iteration, and its value will be `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The final state of `n` and `m` will be the values provided in the last test case, and `ans` will be the last calculated value before the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The function calculates a value `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all integers `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The calculated value `ans` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the values of `n` and `m` from the last test case, and the last calculated value of `ans` is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. The program should be checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the current implementation does not do this. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2, m = 3`. The correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the given program will output a different result because it incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
