Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. The program should be checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the current implementation does not do this. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2, m = 3`. The correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the given program will output a different result because it incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
