### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer (`lex`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function attempts to decode the integer `lex` into three letters by appending values to the `arr` list.
   - The logic for appending values to `arr` is flawed:
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it doesn't handle cases where `lex` is between 28 and 52 properly.
     - If `lex < 52`, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't handle cases where `lex` is between 28 and 52 properly.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it doesn't handle cases where `lex` is between 52 and 78 properly.
   - The correct approach should be to find the largest possible value for the first letter, then the largest possible value for the second letter, and the remaining value for the third letter. This ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The function sorts the `arr` list, which is unnecessary because the values should be determined in a way that they are already in the correct order.
   - The function then converts the positions to characters and prints the decoded word.

### Correct Approach:
- For a given `lex`, the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters whose positions sum up to `lex`.
- To achieve this, we should:
  - Start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1 for 'a').
  - Then, find the largest possible value for the second letter such that the sum of the first two letters is less than or equal to `lex - 1`.
  - The third letter is then determined by the remaining value.

### Example:
- For `lex = 24`:
  - The smallest possible value for the first letter is 1 ('a').
  - The largest possible value for the second letter such that the sum is less than or equal to 23 is 22 ('v').
  - The third letter is 1 ('a').
  - The word is "aav".

- For `lex = 70`:
  - The smallest possible value for the first letter is 1 ('a').
  - The largest possible value for the second letter such that the sum is less than or equal to 69 is 26 ('z').
  - The third letter is 26 ('z').
  - The word is "azz".

- For `lex = 55`:
  - The smallest possible value for the first letter is 3 ('c').
  - The largest possible value for the second letter such that the sum is less than or equal to 52 is 26 ('z').
  - The third letter is 26 ('z').
  - The word is "czz".

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the decoding logic, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. The approach of appending fixed values and then sorting is not appropriate for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correctness:
**False**
