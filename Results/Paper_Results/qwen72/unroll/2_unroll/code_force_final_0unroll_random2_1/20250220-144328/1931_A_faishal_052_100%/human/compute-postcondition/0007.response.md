Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (where 3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) and decodes it into three lowercase Latin letters whose positions sum up to `lex`. The decoded letters are printed in ascending order of their positions. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded strings for each test case. After the function concludes, the `info` list contains `cases` sublists, each with three integers representing the positions of the decoded letters, and each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The `cases` variable remains unchanged. **
