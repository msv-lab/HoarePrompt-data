Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To align with the problem description, the function should be defined as:

```python
def func(n):
```

With the updated function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**
