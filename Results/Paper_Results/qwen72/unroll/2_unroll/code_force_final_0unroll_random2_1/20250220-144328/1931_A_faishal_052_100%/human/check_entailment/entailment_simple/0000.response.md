Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded values for each test case.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value `lex` by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value (26) if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, and the smallest possible value (1) if `lex` is less than 28.
   - However, the logic for handling the middle range (28 to 51) is missing, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program should handle the middle range by subtracting the next largest possible value (25) if `lex` is between 28 and 51, to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is found.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After constructing the list `arr` with the positions of the letters, the program sorts the list to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The program then converts the positions back to characters and prints the result.

Given the missing logic for handling the middle range, the program will not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word. For example, for the input `70`, the correct output should be `rzz` (18 + 26 + 26), but the current logic might produce an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
