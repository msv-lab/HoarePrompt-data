You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a of n integers. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a of n integers. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. results is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers 'results', where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in the list 'test_cases'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a list of integers `results`, where each integer is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers 'results', where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in the list 'test_cases'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
