You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) as it iterates through the array.
   - For each element \(a_i\) in the array:
     - It calculates \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_i \% y\).
     - It determines the required values \(required\_mod\_x\) and \(required\_mod\_y\) such that:
       - \(required\_mod\_x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\). This is because \(a_i + a_j\) should be divisible by \(x\), so \(a_j\) should have a remainder \((x - a_i \% x) \% x\) when divided by \(x\).
       - \(required\_mod\_y = a_i \% y\). This is because \(a_i - a_j\) should be divisible by \(y\), so \(a_j\) should have the same remainder as \(a_i\) when divided by \(y\).
     - It checks if the pair \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `beautiful_count`.
     - It updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly calculates the remainders of each element when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The required remainders for the conditions to be met are correctly calculated.
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs that satisfy both conditions by using the `freq` dictionary.
   - The program processes each test case independently and collects the results in the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(x\) and \(y\) are different.
   - It correctly handles the case where the array has duplicate elements.
   - It correctly handles the case where no pairs satisfy the conditions.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `freq` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
