Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a of n integers. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
