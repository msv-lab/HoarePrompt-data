Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed in the way it calculates the required modulo values and updates the frequency dictionary.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `required_mod_x`:**
   - The function calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is intended to find the value that, when added to `num`, will make the sum divisible by `x`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be to find the value that, when added to `num`, results in a multiple of `x`. This can be done by checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`, which means `a_i % x + a_j % x` should be `0` or `x`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `required_mod_y`:**
   - The function sets `required_mod_y` to `mod_y`, which is incorrect. The condition for a pair to be beautiful is that `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`. This means `a_i % y - a_j % y` should be `0` or `y` (or `-y`).

3. **Frequency Dictionary Update:**
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is updated to count the occurrences of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)`. However, the logic for counting the beautiful pairs is flawed because it does not correctly account for the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly count the beautiful pairs, you should:
- Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
- Check if both conditions are satisfied for each pair:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- Count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This corrected program will correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
