### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) as it iterates through the array.
   - For each element \(a_i\) in the array:
     - It calculates \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_i \% y\).
     - It determines the required values \(required\_mod\_x\) and \(required\_mod\_y\) such that:
       - \(required\_mod\_x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\). This is because \(a_i + a_j\) should be divisible by \(x\), so \(a_j\) should have a remainder \((x - a_i \% x) \% x\) when divided by \(x\).
       - \(required\_mod\_y = a_i \% y\). This is because \(a_i - a_j\) should be divisible by \(y\), so \(a_j\) should have the same remainder as \(a_i\) when divided by \(y\).
     - It checks if the pair \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `beautiful_count`.
     - It updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Remainder Calculation:**
     - The program correctly calculates the remainders of each element when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - **Required Remainders:**
     - The required remainders for the conditions to be met are correctly calculated.
   - **Pair Counting:**
     - The program correctly counts the number of pairs that satisfy both conditions by using the `freq` dictionary.
   - **Test Case Handling:**
     - The program processes each test case independently and collects the results in the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Different \(x\) and \(y\):**
     - The program handles the case where \(x\) and \(y\) are different.
   - **Duplicate Elements:**
     - It correctly handles the case where the array has duplicate elements.
   - **No Pairs:**
     - It correctly handles the case where no pairs satisfy the conditions.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `freq` dictionary.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
  - `test_cases` is a list of dictionaries, each containing:
    - `'params'` with a tuple of three integers (n, x, y).
    - `'array'` with a list of n integers.
  - The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

- **Processing Each Test Case:**
  - For each test case, the program initializes `freq` and `beautiful_count`.
  - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
  - It determines the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.
  - It checks if the required pair is in `freq` and updates `beautiful_count` accordingly.
  - It updates `freq` with the current pair.

- **Final State:**
  - The program returns a list of integers `results`, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and handles all edge cases efficiently.

Final: **True**
