You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES

    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the t test cases contains a string s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the t test cases has been processed, and for each test case, if the string s had a length of 1 or all characters were the same, "No" was printed. Otherwise, "Yes" was printed followed by a shuffled version of s (or a modified version if the shuffle resulted in the same string). The variable s is undefined or reset for each iteration, and the loop has completed all t iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), where each test case includes a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each test case, if the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of `s` (or a modified version if the shuffle resulted in the same string). After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the variable `s` is undefined or reset for each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program prints "No" because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **All Characters Identical:**
   - If the length of the string `s` is greater than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program prints "No" because it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
   - This is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **General Case:**
   - If the string `s` has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - The `random.sample` function returns a new list containing all the elements from `s` in a random order.
   - The program then joins this list into a new string `s2`.
   - If `s2` happens to be the same as `s`, the program rearranges `s2` by moving the first character to the end of the string (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Analysis:
- The program handles the edge cases correctly (single character strings and strings with all identical characters).
- For the general case, the program uses a random shuffle to generate a new string. If the shuffle results in the same string, it performs a simple rearrangement to ensure the new string is different.
- The simple rearrangement (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`) is guaranteed to produce a different string if the original string has at least two different characters.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
