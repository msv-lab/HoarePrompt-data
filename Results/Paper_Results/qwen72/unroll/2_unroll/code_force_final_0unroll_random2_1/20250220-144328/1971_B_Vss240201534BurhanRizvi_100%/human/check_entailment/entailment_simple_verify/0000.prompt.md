You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the t test cases contains a string s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the t test cases has been processed, and for each test case, if the string s had a length of 1 or all characters were the same, "No" was printed. Otherwise, "Yes" was printed followed by a shuffled version of s (or a modified version if the shuffle resulted in the same string). The variable s is undefined or reset for each iteration, and the loop has completed all t iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string has a length of 2 and both characters are the same. For example, if the input is "aa", the program will output "No" because it checks if the length of the set of characters is 1 and the length of the string is greater than 1. However, the problem description does not specify that the string must have more than 2 characters to be rearranged; it only states that the rearranged string should not be equal to the original string. In this case, a valid rearrangement would be "aa" -> "aa" (which is not allowed), but the program incorrectly concludes that it's impossible to rearrange the string. A correct implementation should check if the string can be rearranged to a different string, even if the string length is 2.
