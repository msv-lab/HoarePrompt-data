Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `moves` is assigned a list containing two elements: the first element is `min(t, idx)` and the second element is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, `start`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `moves` depend on the values of `t`, `idx`, and `n`, but they are calculated as described.
