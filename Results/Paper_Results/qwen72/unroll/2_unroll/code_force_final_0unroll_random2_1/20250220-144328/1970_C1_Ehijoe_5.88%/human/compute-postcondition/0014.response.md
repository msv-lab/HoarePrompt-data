Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on an external input consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The function returns the result of some operation based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided information.**
