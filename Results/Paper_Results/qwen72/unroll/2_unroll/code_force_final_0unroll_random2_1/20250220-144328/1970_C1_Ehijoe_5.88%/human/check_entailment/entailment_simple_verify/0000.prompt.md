You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

    empty = True

        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers that represent a sequence where each pair `(u, v)` from the input is added to the deque based on the conditions in the loop, and `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the condition is met. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves. According to the problem description, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the game starts with a stone on one of these nodes. If the starting node is a leaf, the player who starts (Ron) will lose immediately because there are no inactive neighbors to move the stone to. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will still attempt to calculate the number of moves, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
The tree is a simple path: 1 - 3 - 2. The starting node is 1, which is a leaf. Ron should lose immediately, but the program will incorrectly calculate the number of moves and may output "Ron" instead of "Hermione".
