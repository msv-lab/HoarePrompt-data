Precondition: **The function `func` is designed to interact with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. Each query involves selecting four indices (a, b, c, d) within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a comparison result between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4.**
