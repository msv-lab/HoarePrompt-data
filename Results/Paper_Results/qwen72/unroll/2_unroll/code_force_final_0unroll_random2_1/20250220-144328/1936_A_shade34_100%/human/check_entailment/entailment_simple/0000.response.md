### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the index that maximizes the bitwise OR value when compared with itself.
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, and for each index `i`, it makes a query `? mak mak i i` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This ensures that `mak` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum OR Value:**
   - The variable `mak2` is initialized to the value of `mak`. This variable is used to keep track of the second index that will be used to find the maximum XOR value.
   - The list `pans` is initialized to store indices that have the same OR value as `mak2`.
   - The second loop iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and for each index, it makes a query `? mak mak2 i mak2` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result of the query is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`. This ensures that `pans` contains all indices that have the same OR value as `mak2`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Value:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the index in `pans` that maximizes the XOR value when compared with `mak2`.
   - The third loop iterates over all indices in `pans` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`, and for each index `i`, it makes a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` to compare `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This ensures that `mak` is the index in `pans` that has the highest value.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function prints the result `! mak2 pans[mak]` which is the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value.
   - The output is flushed to ensure it is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the index `mak` with the highest value in the permutation.
- It then identifies all indices `pans` that have the same OR value as `mak2`.
- Finally, it finds the index in `pans` that maximizes the XOR value with `mak2`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `len(pans)-1` queries, which is at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is at most `3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It uses the queries efficiently to find the required indices and outputs the correct result.
