### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0. This variable will hold the index of the element with the maximum bitwise OR value.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and for each index `i`, it makes a query `? mak mak i i`.
   - The query compares `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. Since `p_i | p_i` is just `p_i`, this effectively compares `p_mak` with `p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_mak < p_i`, and `mak` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to the value of `mak` found in the previous step.
   - It initializes an empty list `pans` to store indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR value as `mak2`.
   - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and makes a query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
   - The query compares `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_mak | p_mak2 < p_i | p_mak2`, and `mak` is updated to `i`, and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p_mak | p_mak2 = p_i | p_mak2`, and `i` is appended to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0 again.
   - It iterates through the indices in `pans` and makes a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
   - The query compares `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p_pans[mak] > p_pans[i]`, and `mak` is updated to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair of indices that maximize the XOR value.
   - It flushes the output to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop makes `n` queries.
  - The third loop makes `len(pans) - 1` queries, where `len(pans)` is at most `n`.
  - The total number of queries is at most `2n + (n - 1) = 3n - 1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The first loop correctly finds the index `mak` of the element with the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly finds all indices `pans` that have the same maximum bitwise OR value as `mak2`.
  - The third loop correctly finds the index `pans[mak]` that maximizes the XOR value with `mak2`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 2` correctly by finding the maximum XOR value, which is always 1.
  - The program also handles the case where multiple indices have the same maximum bitwise OR value by storing them in `pans` and then finding the maximum XOR among them.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly finds a pair of indices that maximize the XOR value using at most `3n` queries.

Correctness: **True**
