Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. For example: `def distribute_coins(t, n, k):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and `k` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome.**
