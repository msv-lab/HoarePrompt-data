The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `list_of_tuples`, and `list_of_strings`. `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000. `list_of_tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` with the constraints 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5. `list_of_strings` is a list of strings, where each string has a length of `n` and contains characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a list of strings where each string is of length `n` and contains characters from 'A' to 'G'. It always returns 0.**
