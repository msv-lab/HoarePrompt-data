### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Data Structures**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `s`. This is a good approach to keep track of the available problems.

3. **Initialization**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with keys 'A' to 'G' and their values set to 0. This ensures that all difficulty levels are accounted for, even if they are not present in the input string.

4. **Counting Problems**: The program iterates over the input string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found. This correctly populates the `defaultdict` with the number of problems of each difficulty.

5. **Calculating Missing Problems**: The program then iterates over the keys of the `defaultdict` and calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. The calculation `ans = ans + m - d[val]` is correct for this purpose.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case, which is the sum of the missing problems for all difficulty levels.

However, there is one issue in the program:

- **Default Value for defaultdict**: The program uses `default_value` as the default value for the `defaultdict`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program is almost correct, but it will fail due to the undefined `default_value` in the `defaultdict` initialization. To fix this, you should either define `default_value` or use `int` as the default factory for the `defaultdict` since `int` will return 0 by default.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected: Use int as the default factory
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:  # Corrected: Use < instead of <= to avoid counting already sufficient problems
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Correctness of the Corrected Program:
**True**

The corrected program will correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.
