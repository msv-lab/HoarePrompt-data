Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a list of strings a where each string is of length n and contains characters from 'A' to 'G'.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a` as described above. Here is the corrected precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple containing two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
