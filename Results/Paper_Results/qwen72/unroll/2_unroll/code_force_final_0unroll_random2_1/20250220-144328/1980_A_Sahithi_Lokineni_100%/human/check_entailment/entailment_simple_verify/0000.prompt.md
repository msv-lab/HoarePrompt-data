You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a list of strings a where each string is of length n and contains characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not properly initialize the `defaultdict` with a default value function. The line `d = defaultdict(default_value)` should be `d = defaultdict(int)`. This is because `default_value` is not defined, and the program will raise a `NameError` when it tries to initialize the `defaultdict`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of problems required for a difficulty level is exactly `m`. The logic in the loop `for val in d.keys():` should check if the number of problems for a difficulty level is less than `m`, not less than or equal to `m`. This is because if the number of problems is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
