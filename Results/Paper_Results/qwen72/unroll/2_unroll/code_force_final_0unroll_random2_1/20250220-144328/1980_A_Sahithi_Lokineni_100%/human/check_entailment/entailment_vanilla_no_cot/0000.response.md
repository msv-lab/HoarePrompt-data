Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with a `default_value` function, but this function is not defined until later in the code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program runs. The correct way to initialize `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is to use `defaultdict(int)`.

2. **Logic for Counting Required Problems**: The logic for counting the required problems is incorrect. The program should check if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than `m` (the number of rounds) and then calculate the difference. However, the current logic checks if the number of problems is less than or equal to `m` and adds `m - d[val]` to the answer. This will incorrectly count the number of problems needed if the number of problems of a certain difficulty is exactly `m`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization of `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `int`, which provides a default value of 0 for any key that is not already in the dictionary.
2. **Counting Required Problems**: The program iterates over the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and checks if the number of problems of each difficulty is less than `m`. If so, it calculates the difference and adds it to `ans`.

This corrected program should now work correctly for the given problem description.
