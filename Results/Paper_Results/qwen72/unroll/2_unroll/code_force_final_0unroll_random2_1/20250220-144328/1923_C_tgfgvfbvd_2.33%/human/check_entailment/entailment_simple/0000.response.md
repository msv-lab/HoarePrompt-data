### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` and initializes a prefix sum array `p` to store cumulative sums of `l`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `p` correctly. Each element `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b` (1-based).
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `l[a-1]` to `l[b-1]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
     - The sum `s` of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.

4. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - **Condition 1:** The sum of the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` should be equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - **Condition 2:** For every index `i` in the subarray, `a_i` should not be equal to `b_i`.
   - **Condition 3:** Every element `b_i` in the subarray should be greater than 0.

   The program's logic for checking if the subarray is good is based on the idea that if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, it is possible to construct a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `a`.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1 by checking `b - a + 1 > 1`. If the subarray length is 1, it is impossible to construct a different array `b` that satisfies all conditions, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray sum is less than twice its length, which would make it impossible to construct a different array `b` with the required properties.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
