The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state (t, n, q, c, l_i, r_i) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1, which will make the loop execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
