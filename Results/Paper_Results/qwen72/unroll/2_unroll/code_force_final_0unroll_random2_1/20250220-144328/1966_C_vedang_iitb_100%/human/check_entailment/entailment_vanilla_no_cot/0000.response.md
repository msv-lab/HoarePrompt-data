Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. Specifically, the program uses a variable `mexsize` to track the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list of pile sizes. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the game's rules, where the players can remove a number of stones equal to the smallest nonempty pile size from all nonempty piles.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to check if the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd or even. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move effectively reduces the number of stones in all nonempty piles by the same amount, and the game state alternates between odd and even numbers of stones in the piles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for sz in a if sz % 2 == 1)
        print('Alice' if odd_count % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')

func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determines the winner based on the parity of this count.
