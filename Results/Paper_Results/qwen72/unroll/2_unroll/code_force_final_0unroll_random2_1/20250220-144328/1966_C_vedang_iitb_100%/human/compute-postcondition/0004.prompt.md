You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists stones where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. Each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        maxsize = max(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        mexsize = 1
        
        for sz in a:
            if sz == mexsize:
                mexsize = mexsize + 1
        
        if mexsize > maxsize:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. The list `stones` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The loop has printed the result ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `stones` where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the piles of stones provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
