t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the k lines contains n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0}, who is always at the top of their own list. All authors of the screenshots are different.
