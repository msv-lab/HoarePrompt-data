The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept input in a specific format, typically through standard input or a predefined input method. The input consists of multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5`. Each test case also includes `k` lines, each containing `n` distinct integers `a_{ij}` where `1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n`, representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`. The function processes these inputs and returns the results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. For each test case, it also processes `k` lines of `n` distinct integers each, representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot. The function returns the results for each test case.**
