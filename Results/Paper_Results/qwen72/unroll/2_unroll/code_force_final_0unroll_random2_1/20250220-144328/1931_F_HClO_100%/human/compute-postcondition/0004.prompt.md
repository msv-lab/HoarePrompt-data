You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n integers a_{ij} where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n and all a_{ij} are distinct, representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all the authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop reads `n` and `k`, and then reads `k` lines of integers. The loop checks if the order of participants shown to each participant is consistent with the conditions specified. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After all test cases are processed, the initial state of `t` is unchanged, and the variables `n`, `k`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` are reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. For each test case, it also processes `k` lines of `n` distinct integers each, representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot. The function returns the results for each test case.
