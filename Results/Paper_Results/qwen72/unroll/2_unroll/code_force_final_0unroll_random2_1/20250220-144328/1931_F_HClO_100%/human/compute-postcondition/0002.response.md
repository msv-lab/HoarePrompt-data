Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop reads `n` and `k`, and then reads `k` lines of integers. The loop checks if the order of participants shown to each participant is consistent with the conditions specified. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After all test cases are processed, the initial state of `t` is unchanged, and the variables `n`, `k`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` are reset for each new test case.**
