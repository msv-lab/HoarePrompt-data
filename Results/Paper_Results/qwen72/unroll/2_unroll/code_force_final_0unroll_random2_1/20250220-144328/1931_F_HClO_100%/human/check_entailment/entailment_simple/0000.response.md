### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot (m == 1):**
   - If there is only one screenshot, the program immediately prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always be consistent with the order of participants.
   - This is correct and handles the edge case efficiently.

2. **Reading and Comparing the First Two Screenshots:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and stores them in `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
   - It then removes the author of the second screenshot from the first list and the author of the first screenshot from the second list.
   - If the modified lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary to ensure that the order of participants, excluding the author, is consistent between the two screenshots.

3. **Finding the Indices of Mismatch:**
   - The program then tries to find the indices where the lists `l1` and `l2` differ.
   - It checks if the mismatch is due to the authors being in different positions and updates the indices `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly.
   - If the indices are not found, it handles the case where one of the indices is missing and sets the other index to `n - 2`.
   - This step is crucial for determining the correct order of participants.

4. **Inserting the Authors Back:**
   - Based on the indices found, the program inserts the authors back into the lists to form a consistent order.
   - If there are more than two screenshots, it reads the third screenshot and uses it to determine the correct order.
   - This step ensures that the order is consistent with the third screenshot if available.

5. **Checking Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The program then reads the remaining screenshots and checks if they are consistent with the determined order.
   - It uses a list comprehension to remove the author from the determined order and compares it with the screenshot.
   - If any screenshot is inconsistent, it prints "no" and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots are consistent, it prints "yes".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem by ensuring that the order of participants shown to each user is consistent with the conditions specified. It efficiently checks for the edge cases and uses the indices of mismatches to determine the correct order. The logic is sound and the program should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
