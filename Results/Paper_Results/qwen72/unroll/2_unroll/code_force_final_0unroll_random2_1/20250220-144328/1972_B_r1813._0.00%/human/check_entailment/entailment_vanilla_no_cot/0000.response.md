Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description. The logic of the program is to read the input, process each test case, and determine the winner by checking the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the first move and force Bob into a losing position. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that he is the one to make the last move. The program correctly implements this logic and prints the results for each test case.
