The function `solve_coin_game` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, s)`.
