### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It initializes `index` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, so the program appends `'YES'` to the `results` list.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win, so the program appends `'NO'` to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move available when it's his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (`num_up_coins == 0`), which results in a loss for the player whose turn it is.
  - The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one coin left, as no coins will be flipped in this scenario.

- **Input and Output**:
  - The program reads the input in the correct format and processes multiple test cases as specified.
  - The output is correctly formatted, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output as required and covers all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
