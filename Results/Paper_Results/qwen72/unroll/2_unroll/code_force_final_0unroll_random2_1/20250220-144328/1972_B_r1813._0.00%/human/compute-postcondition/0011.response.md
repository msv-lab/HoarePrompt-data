Functionality: ** The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If it is, the function appends 'YES' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list. The function does not return any value. **
