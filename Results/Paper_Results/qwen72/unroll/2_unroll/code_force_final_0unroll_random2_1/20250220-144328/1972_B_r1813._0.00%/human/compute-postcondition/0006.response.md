The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop indicates that `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `s` are as described, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
