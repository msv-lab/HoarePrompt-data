The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take the value of 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
