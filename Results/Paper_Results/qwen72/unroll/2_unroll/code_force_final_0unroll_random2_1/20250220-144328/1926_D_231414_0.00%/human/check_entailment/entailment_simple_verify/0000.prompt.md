You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the way it attempts to group the numbers. Specifically, the program uses a dictionary to track the XOR results and the count of each number, but it does not correctly handle the grouping condition. The condition requires that in any group, no two numbers should have the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits. However, the program's logic for updating the dictionary and the `ans` variable does not ensure this.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
1
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The numbers are 1 (00000000000000000000000000000001_2), 2 (00000000000000000000000000000010_2), and 3 (00000000000000000000000000000011_2).
- The correct grouping should be:
  - Group 1: [1, 2]
  - Group 2: [3]
- This is because 1 and 2 do not have any matching bits in the 31 least significant bits, and 3 cannot be in the same group as either 1 or 2.

However, the program's output is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the grouping logic. It prints `2` initially, then `1`, and finally `1`, which does not match the expected output of `2`. This indicates that the program is not correctly determining the minimum number of groups required.
