The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_groups(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 representing the number of integers in each test case, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 for each integer in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
