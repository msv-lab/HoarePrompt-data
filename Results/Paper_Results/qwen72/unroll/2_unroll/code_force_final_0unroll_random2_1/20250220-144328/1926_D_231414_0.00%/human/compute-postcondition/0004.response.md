The function `min_groups` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in each test case, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_j` satisfies the constraint 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the minimum number of groups required to partition the list `a` such that the sum of integers in each group does not exceed a certain threshold, which is not specified in the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. It returns the minimum number of groups required to partition the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that the sum of integers in each group does not exceed a certain threshold.**
