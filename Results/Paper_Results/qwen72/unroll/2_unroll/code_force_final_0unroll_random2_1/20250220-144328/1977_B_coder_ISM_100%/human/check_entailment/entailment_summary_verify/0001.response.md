### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` but with possible modifications to ensure the constraints are met.
   - It uses a loop to check each bit of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the bit is set or not.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The program uses a flag to track whether a modification is needed to ensure no two adjacent elements are non-zero.
   - It iterates through the array `s` and checks for adjacent '1's. If it finds them, it sets the current element to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating that the next element should be modified.
   - If the flag is set and the next element is '0', it changes the next element to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the next element is also '1', it continues to the next element and sets it to '0'.
   - This logic is generally correct but can be a bit tricky to follow. It ensures that no two adjacent elements are non-zero by propagating the carry forward.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last element is '1', it changes the last element to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.
   - This part is also correct and ensures that the final array meets the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s`.
   - It prints the elements of the array `s`.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation**:
  - The initial binary representation is correctly generated by checking each bit of `x`.
  - The array `s` is initialized with '0's and '1's based on the binary representation of `x`.

- **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Elements**:
  - The logic to handle adjacent '1's is correct. It ensures that no two adjacent elements are non-zero by setting the current element to '-1' and the next element to '1' when needed.
  - The flag mechanism is used to propagate the carry forward, which is a valid approach.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final adjustments to ensure the constraints are met are correct. The program handles the last element and the flag appropriately.
  - The logic for appending an additional '1' to the array when the flag is set at the last element is correct and necessary to meet the constraints.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases where `x` is a power of 2 or has a simple binary representation.
  - The logic for appending an additional '1' to the array when the flag is set at the last element is a bit convoluted but works correctly.

- **Simplification**:
  - The logic for handling the flag and modifying the array can be simplified to make the program more readable and maintainable.
  - However, the current implementation is functionally correct and meets the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and handles the problem constraints as described. The logic for handling adjacent non-zero elements and the final adjustments is valid and ensures that the output meets the requirements. While the code can be simplified for better readability, the current implementation is functionally correct.
