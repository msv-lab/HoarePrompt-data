Output State: **The loop modifies the binary representation of `x` by flipping certain bits based on specific conditions. After all iterations, `x` is no longer directly accessible, but its modified binary representation is stored in the list `s`. The length of `s` is printed, which is either 30 or 31 depending on whether an extra bit was appended. The list `s` contains the modified binary representation of `x`, with some bits potentially set to '1', '0', or '-1'. The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations performed. The variable `nalla` is not used in the loop and remains unchanged.**
