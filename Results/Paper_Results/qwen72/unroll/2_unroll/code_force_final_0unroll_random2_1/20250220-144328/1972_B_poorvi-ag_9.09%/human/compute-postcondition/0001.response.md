Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". The variable `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The variable `results` is an empty list.**
