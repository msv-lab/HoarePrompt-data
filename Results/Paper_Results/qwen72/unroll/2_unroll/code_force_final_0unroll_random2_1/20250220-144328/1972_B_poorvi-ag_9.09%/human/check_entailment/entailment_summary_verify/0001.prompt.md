You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines and prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the following conditions: if `n` is even, the result is 'no'; if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, the result is 'yes'; otherwise, the result is 'no'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circle of `n` coins, each of which can be either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the game.
   - We need to determine if Alice (the first player) will win the game if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n` is even, the game is always a loss for Alice. This is because if `n` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who faces the situation with no facing-up coins.
   - If `n` is odd, the game's outcome depends on the initial configuration of the coins. Specifically, if there are more "U" coins than "D" coins, Alice can always win by playing optimally. This is because Alice can always choose a "U" coin and flip the adjacent coins, maintaining a configuration where she has more "U" coins than Bob.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial configuration of the coins `arr`.
   - The program then checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it appends "no" to the results list, indicating that Alice will lose.
   - If `n` is odd, it counts the number of "U" and "D" coins using the `count` method. If there are more "U" coins than "D" coins, it appends "yes" to the results list, indicating that Alice will win. Otherwise, it appends "no".
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is even by always appending "no" to the results list.
   - For the case where `n` is odd, the program checks if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins. This is a valid strategy because if there are more "U" coins, Alice can always play optimally to win.
   - The program uses the `count` method to count the "U" and "D" coins, which is efficient and correct.
   - The program prints the results in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
