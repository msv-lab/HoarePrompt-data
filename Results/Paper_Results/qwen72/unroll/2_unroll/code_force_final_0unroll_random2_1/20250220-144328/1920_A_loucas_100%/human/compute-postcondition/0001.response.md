The only objects in the loop head are the variables `iterable` and `loop`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` and `n` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `loop` must be greater than 0, and `iterable` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
