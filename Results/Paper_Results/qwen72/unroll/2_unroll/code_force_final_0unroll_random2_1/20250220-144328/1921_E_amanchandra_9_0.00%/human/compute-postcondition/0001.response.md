Output State: **The loop processes all test cases and prints the result for each case as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset and re-assigned for each test case, and their final values are the ones from the last test case processed. The loop itself does not modify any other variables outside its scope.**
