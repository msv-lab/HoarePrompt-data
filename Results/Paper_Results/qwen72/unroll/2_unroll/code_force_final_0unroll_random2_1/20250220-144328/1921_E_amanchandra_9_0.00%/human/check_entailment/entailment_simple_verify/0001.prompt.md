You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The inputs are such that `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips do not coincide (`x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`). Additionally, the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.

    for i in range(int(input())):

    #State: The loop processes all test cases and prints the result for each case as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset and re-assigned for each test case, and their final values are the ones from the last test case processed. The loop itself does not modify any other variables outside its scope.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case using `input()` and `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip (`xa > xb`). If this is true, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, and they will not meet.

3. **Calculating Moves:**
   - The program calculates the number of moves required for Alice and Bob to potentially meet, which is `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - It then checks if the number of moves is odd or even using `abs(xa - xb) % 2`.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is odd, the program calculates the range of columns where Alice can move to meet Bob:
     - `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice's initial column `ya` is within the range of columns where she can meet Bob within `x + 1` moves. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is even, the program calculates the range of columns where Bob can move to meet Alice:
     - `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if Bob's initial column `yb` is within the range of columns where he can meet Alice within `x` moves. If so, Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Column Range Calculation for Bob:**
  - In the even number of moves case, the program incorrectly calculates the range of columns for Bob. It should be `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` instead of `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.

- **Incorrect Win Condition for Bob:**
  - The win condition for Bob is also incorrect. It should check if `ya` is within the range of columns where Bob can meet Alice, not `yb`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                if l <= ya <= r:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                if l <= ya <= r:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the column range calculation and win condition for Bob.
- After correcting these issues, the program should correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
