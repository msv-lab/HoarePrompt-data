Precondition: **The function should accept a list of integers `x` where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, and n is the length of the array `a` which is at least 2 and does not exceed 500. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should include parameters for the test cases and the array `x`. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` of length `n-1`.
