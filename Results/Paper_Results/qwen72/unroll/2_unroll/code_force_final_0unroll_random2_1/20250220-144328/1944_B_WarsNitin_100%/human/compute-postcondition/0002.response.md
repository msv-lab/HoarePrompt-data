Output State: **For each test case, the loop outputs two lines of integers. The first line contains the integers from the first half of the sorted array `b` that are either duplicates or unique and not part of the last pair of duplicates. The second line contains the integers from the second half of the sorted array `c` that are duplicates. Both lines contain exactly `k` integers each, where `k` is the input value for that test case.**
