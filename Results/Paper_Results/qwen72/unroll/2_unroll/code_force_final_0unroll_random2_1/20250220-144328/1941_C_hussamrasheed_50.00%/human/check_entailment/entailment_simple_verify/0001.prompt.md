You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `t` should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the variable `m` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, and the variable `p` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The sum `m + p` is printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - We need to handle multiple test cases, each with a different string.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string.
   - Next, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program only counts and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" as whole substrings.
   - However, the problem requires us to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring in the resulting string.
   - The program does not consider overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still make the string ugly.
   - For example, if the string is "mappie", the program will count "map" once and "pie" once, but removing "map" will leave "pie" intact, and removing "pie" will leave "map" intact. The correct approach should be to remove the minimum number of characters to break both substrings.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring.
   - This can be done by iterating through the string and identifying positions where "pie" or "map" can be formed, and then determining the minimum deletions needed to break these substrings.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts and removes whole substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the minimum deletions required to break these substrings in the string.

Correctness: **False**
