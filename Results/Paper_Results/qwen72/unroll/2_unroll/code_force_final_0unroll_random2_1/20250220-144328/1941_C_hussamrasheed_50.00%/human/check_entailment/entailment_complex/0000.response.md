Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in how the program attempts to count and remove the substrings "map" and "pie". The program only counts and removes "map" before counting "pie", which can lead to incorrect results if the substrings overlap or if removing "map" creates new "pie" substrings that were not present initially.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will:
1. Count 1 occurrence of "map".
2. Remove "map" to get "pie".
3. Count 1 occurrence of "pie".

The program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 3 because removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful requires removing the 'm', 'a', and 'p' from "mappie".

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where "pie" and "map" overlap correctly. For example, in the string "mapie", removing "map" would leave "ie", and the program would incorrectly count 0 for "pie".

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify and remove overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map".
2. Ensure that the minimum number of characters is removed to make the string beautiful.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
