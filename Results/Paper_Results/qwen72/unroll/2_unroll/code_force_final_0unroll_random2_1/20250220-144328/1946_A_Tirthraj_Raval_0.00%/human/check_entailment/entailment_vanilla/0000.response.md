Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to find the median.

3. **Finding the Median Index**:
   - The median index `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This is correct because it finds the middle index for both odd and even lengths of the array.

4. **Counting the Median Value**:
   - The program counts the number of occurrences of the median value `a[p]` in the array using `a.count(a[p])`.
   - This count is stored in the variable `res`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `res` for each test case.

However, the logic for counting the median value and using it as the result is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median, not just the count of the median value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the current median.
3. Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
4. Calculate the number of operations required to increase the current median to this smallest number.

### Example Analysis:
- For the array `[2, 2, 8]`:
  - Sorted array: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Median index: `1` (value `2`)
  - Smallest number greater than `2` is `8`.
  - Operations required: `1` (increase one `2` to `3`).

- For the array `[7, 3, 3, 1]`:
  - Sorted array: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`
  - Median index: `1` (value `3`)
  - Smallest number greater than `3` is `7`.
  - Operations required: `2` (increase two `3`s to `4`).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        # Find the smallest number greater than the current median
        next_median = current_median + 1
        while next_median not in a[p+1:]:
            next_median += 1
        # Calculate the number of operations required
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
            else:
                break
        print(operations)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Finding the Next Median**: We start from `current_median + 1` and keep incrementing until we find a number that is in the sorted array.
- **Calculating Operations**: We iterate from the median index to the end of the array, counting the number of operations needed to increase each element to the next median value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. The corrected program addresses this issue.

Correctness: **False**
