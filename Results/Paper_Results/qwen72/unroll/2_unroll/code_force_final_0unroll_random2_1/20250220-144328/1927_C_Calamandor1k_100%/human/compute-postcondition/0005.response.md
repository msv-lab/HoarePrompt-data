Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the conditions for each tuple in `cases` are met. Specifically, 'YES' is appended to `results` if the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` and the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` are both less than or equal to `k // 2`, and the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The `cases` list remains unchanged. **
