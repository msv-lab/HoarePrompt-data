t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, m, k) and two lists (a, b). For each tuple, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), and a and b are lists of integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) with lengths n and m, respectively. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
