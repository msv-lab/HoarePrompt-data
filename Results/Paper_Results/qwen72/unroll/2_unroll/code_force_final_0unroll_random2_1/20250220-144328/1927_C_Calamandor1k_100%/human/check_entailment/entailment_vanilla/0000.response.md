### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` (`n` and `m`), and the even number `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and stores them in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements of arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both arrays (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Condition 1:** If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 2:** Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 3:** If the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` (i.e., `total_distinct`) is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 4:** If none of the above conditions are met, it means it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included, so the program appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
- **Condition 1 and Condition 2:** These conditions ensure that there are enough unique elements in each array to form the required subset of size `k // 2`.
- **Condition 3:** This condition ensures that the total number of distinct elements from both arrays is at least `k`, which is necessary to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
- **Condition 4:** If the above conditions are not violated, the program correctly concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic, ensuring that it can determine whether it is possible to choose the required elements for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
