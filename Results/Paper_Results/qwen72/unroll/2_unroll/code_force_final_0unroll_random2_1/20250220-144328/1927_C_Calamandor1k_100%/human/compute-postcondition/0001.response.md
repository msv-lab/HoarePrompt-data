To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as part of the `cases` list. The loop will execute if `cases` contains at least one tuple. The state of `t` and `results` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`.
- `results` is an empty list.

The loop will execute if `cases` is not empty. For the first iteration, the first tuple in `cases` will be unpacked into `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `cases` must have at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `cases` is unpacked into `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are the elements of the first tuple in `cases`**
