Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` have enough elements to cover the range from 1 to k, but the elements are not distributed in a way that allows exactly `k // 2` elements to be chosen from each array.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 3 4 5 6
```

In this case:
- `relevant_a` will be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
- `relevant_b` will be `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`

The program will calculate:
- `only_a` as `{1}`
- `only_b` as `{}` (empty set)
- `both` as `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`

The program will then check:
- `len(only_a) > k // 2` (1 > 3) is False
- `len(only_b) > k // 2` (0 > 3) is False
- `total_distinct` as `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)` which is `1 + 0 + 5 = 6`

Since `total_distinct` is equal to `k`, the program will output `YES`. However, it is not possible to choose exactly 3 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to 6 are included, because the number 1 is only in array `a` and cannot be chosen from array `b`.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this test case.
