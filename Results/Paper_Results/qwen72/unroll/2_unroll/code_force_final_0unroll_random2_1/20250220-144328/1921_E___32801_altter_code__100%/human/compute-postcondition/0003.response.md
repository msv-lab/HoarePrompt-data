The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The initial state describes the context and variables that are set before the code is executed, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **draw**
