The code snippet `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `r`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The function should take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases. `r` is a list of integers read from the input.**
