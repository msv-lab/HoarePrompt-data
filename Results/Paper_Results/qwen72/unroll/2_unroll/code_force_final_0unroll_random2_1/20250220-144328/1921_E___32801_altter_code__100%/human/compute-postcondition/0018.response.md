Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and `y2` is `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. However, the current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`, which contradicts the precondition. Therefore, the program should not enter this if condition based on the given precondition.**
