Output State: **`r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is less than `y1`. `a` is `m - y1`.**
