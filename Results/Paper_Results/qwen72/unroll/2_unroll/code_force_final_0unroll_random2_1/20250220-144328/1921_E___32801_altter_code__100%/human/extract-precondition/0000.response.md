Precondition: **The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The function should take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases.**

However, based on the problem description, a more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def game_outcome(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` for each test case. The precondition for this function would be:

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9, and (x_a, y_a) != (x_b, y_b). The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
