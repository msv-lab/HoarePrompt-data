Output State: **`r` is a list of integers, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3] + a` if `y1` < `y2` else `r[3] - 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]` (since `y1` < `y2`), `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `c` is `m - y1`.**
