Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases. However, the function as defined does not accept any parameters and does not return any value in any of the cases.**
