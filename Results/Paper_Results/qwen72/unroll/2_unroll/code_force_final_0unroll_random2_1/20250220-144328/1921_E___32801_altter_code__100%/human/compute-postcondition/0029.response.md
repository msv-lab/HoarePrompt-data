Output State: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]` if `y1` < `y2` else `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number if `y1` < `y2` else an odd number. `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by `a`.
- If `y1` >= `y2`, `a` is `r[5] - 1`, and `x1` is updated to `r[2] + (r[5] - 1)`.
- If `y1` < `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, and `x1` is updated to `r[2] + (r[1] - r[5])`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` remains an even number if `y1` < `y2` and an odd number if `y1` >= `y2`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and the new `x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and the new `y1`.
