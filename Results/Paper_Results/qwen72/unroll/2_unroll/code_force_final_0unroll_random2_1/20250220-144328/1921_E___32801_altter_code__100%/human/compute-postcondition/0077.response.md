Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, and `x2` is still greater than `x1`, with the difference between `x2` and `x1` remaining even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`. `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is 1, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `a` is 0, and `c` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is greater than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[1]`, `y2` is `r[5] + a`, `a` is `m - r[3]`, and `c` is `m - (r[5] + a)`. Additionally, `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, and `1 <= x1 <= n`.**
