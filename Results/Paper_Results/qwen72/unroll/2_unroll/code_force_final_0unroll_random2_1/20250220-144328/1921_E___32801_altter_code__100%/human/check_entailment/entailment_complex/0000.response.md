Reasoning:

The program provided has several issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is not correctly defined to accept parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions. It reads these values directly from the input inside the function, which is not a good practice and can lead to errors if the function is called in a different context.

2. **Case Sensitivity in Output**: The problem description specifies that the output can be in any case (e.g., "Alice", "alice", "ALICE"). However, the program outputs "bob" in lowercase, which is not consistent with the example output where "Bob" is capitalized. This inconsistency might cause the program to fail if the output is case-sensitive.

3. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**: The logic for determining the outcome of the game is complex and involves several conditions. However, the program does not seem to handle all possible scenarios correctly. For example:
   - The condition `if (x2 <= x1) :` should lead to a draw, but it might not always be the case if the chips are in positions where they can still move.
   - The logic for moving the chips and checking if Alice or Bob wins is not clearly explained and might not cover all edge cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where the chips are in positions where they cannot move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row) and should result in a draw. The conditions `if (x2 <= x1 or x1 < 1 or x2 > n) :` and similar checks are used, but they might not be sufficient.

5. **Optimal Play**: The problem states that both players play optimally. The program does not clearly demonstrate how it ensures optimal play. The logic for moving the chips and checking the outcome seems to be based on a series of conditions that might not always lead to the correct result.

6. **Variable Naming and Clarity**: The variable names used in the program (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`) are not descriptive, making it difficult to understand the logic and ensure its correctness.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. It needs to be revised to properly handle the input parameters, ensure consistent output case, and correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
