Output State: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]` if `y1` < `y2` else `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1` if `y1` < `y2` else `x2` is equal to `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number if `y1` < `y2` else an odd number. `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x2` is updated to `r[4] - a`.
- If `y1` < `y2`, then `x2` remains greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is still an even number.
- If `y1` >= `y2`, then `x2` becomes equal to `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number (which is 0, an even number, but this is a contradiction in the initial state, so it must be that `y1` < `y2` for the initial state to hold).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
