Output State: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and `y2` is `r[5]`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` >= `y2`, then `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` remains an odd number. `a` is `r[5] - 1`. If `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is greater than `x1 + 1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number. `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**
