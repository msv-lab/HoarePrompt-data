### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `1 << i + 1` exceeds `k`.
   - It constructs the sequence `ans` with three initial elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It then appends all powers of 2 from 0 to 19 (except `1 << i`) to the sequence `ans`.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **No subsequence sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`.
     - The initial elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen such that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`.
     - The powers of 2 added later are also chosen to avoid summing to `k` when combined with the initial elements.
   - **All other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence sum:**
     - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 from 0 to 19 (except one), which allows for the construction of any sum up to `2^20 - 1` (which is much larger than `n`).
     - The initial elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen to ensure that sums close to `k` can be formed, but not `k` itself.
     - The combination of these elements and the powers of 2 ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

4. **Size of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to have at most 23 elements (3 initial elements + 20 powers of 2).
   - This is within the limit of 25 elements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 by excluding the corresponding power of 2 from the sequence.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is very close to `n` by ensuring that the sequence includes elements that can form sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence `a` that meets all the given conditions. The sequence avoids summing to `k` while ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum. The size of the sequence is also within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is correct.
