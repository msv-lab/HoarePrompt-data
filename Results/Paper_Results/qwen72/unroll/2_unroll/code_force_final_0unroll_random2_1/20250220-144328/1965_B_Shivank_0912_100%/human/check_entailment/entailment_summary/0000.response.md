### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function aims to find a sequence `ans` that meets the given conditions:
     - There should be no subsequence of `ans` that sums to `k`.
     - For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `ans` that sums to `v`.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
   - The function calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using the loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k: i = i + 1`. This ensures that `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The function constructs the sequence `ans` by including:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because it would require adding `1 << i` to `k - (1 << i)`, but `1 << i` is not included in the sequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because it is greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This further ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
   - Additionally, it appends all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` to the sequence, except for `1 << i`. This ensures that all other sums `v` (where `v != k` and `1 <= v <= n`) can be formed by appropriate subsequences of `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the sequence `ans` and the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the required output format.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which satisfies the constraint `1 <= m <= 25`.
   - The elements of `ans` are non-negative integers, which satisfies the constraint `0 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the given conditions for each test case. The logic for avoiding a subsequence that sums to `k` and ensuring all other sums `v` (where `v != k` and `1 <= v <= n`) can be formed is sound.

Correctness: **True**
