The only objects in the loop head are the variables `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `k` <= `n`. However, these conditions do not affect the loop head directly.

For the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0, and `tc` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
