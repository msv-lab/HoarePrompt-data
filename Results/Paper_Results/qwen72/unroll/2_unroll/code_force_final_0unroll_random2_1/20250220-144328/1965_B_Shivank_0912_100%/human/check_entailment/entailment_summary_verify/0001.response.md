### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2, `2^i`, that is less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `2^(i+1)` exceeds `k`.
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This element is chosen to ensure that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because it is less than `k` and the next power of 2 is greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This element is greater than `k` and helps in forming sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This element is also greater than `k` and helps in forming sums greater than `k` and ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
   - The program then appends all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^19` to the sequence `ans`, except for `2^i` which was already used in the initial elements.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence `ans` and the sequence itself.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
     - The initial elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen such that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`. This is because `k - (1 << i)` is less than `k` and the next power of 2 is greater than `k`, making it impossible to form `k` using these elements.
     - The powers of 2 added to `ans` are chosen to cover a wide range of sums, but none of these sums will include `2^i` (which is a key part of forming `k`), ensuring that `k` cannot be formed.
   - **All Other Sums in `[1, n]` Can Be Formed**:
     - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^19` except `2^i`. This ensures that any sum that can be formed by these powers of 2 (which is a large range) can be formed.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in forming sums greater than `k`.
   - **Size Constraint**:
     - The sequence `ans` has at most 23 elements (3 initial elements + 20 powers of 2), which is within the limit of 25.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 or close to a power of 2 by carefully choosing the initial elements.
   - The program ensures that the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums in the range `[1, n]` can be formed. The sequence size is also within the allowed limit.

Final: **True**
