Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function identifies the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `1 << i + 1` exceeds `k`.
   - It then constructs the initial part of the sequence `ans` with the values `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - The function appends all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` to the sequence, except for `1 << i`.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence with Sum `k`**: The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`. The values `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen such that they do not form a subsequence summing to `k`. Additionally, the powers of 2 are chosen to ensure that no combination of these values can sum to `k`.
   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`)**: The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`, which ensures that any sum from 1 to `10^6` can be formed using these values. By excluding `1 << i`, the function ensures that `k` cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed by appropriate combinations of the included values.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the sequence `ans` and then the elements of the sequence for each test case. This matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 by excluding that specific power of 2 from the sequence.
   - The function ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
