You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function then calculates a list `ans` of integers based on the value of `k`. Specifically, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and constructs a list `ans` that includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, where `i` is the exponent of the largest power of 2. Additionally, it appends all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` to the list, except for `1 << i`. The function prints the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their final values from the last test case, and the loop variables `tc`, `i`, and `j` are no longer in scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.
   - The sequence `a` should have a size of at most 25.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2, `2^i`, that is less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `2^(i+1)` exceeds `k`.
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This element ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because it is less than `k` and the next power of 2 is greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This element is greater than `k` and helps in forming sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This element is also greater than `k` and helps in forming sums greater than `k` and ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
   - The program then appends all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^19` (which is 20 elements) to the sequence `ans`, except for `2^i` which was already used in the initial elements.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence `ans` and the sequence itself.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
     - The sequence `ans` is constructed in such a way that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. The initial elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen to ensure this.
     - The powers of 2 added to `ans` are chosen to cover all other possible sums without forming `k`.
   - **All Other Sums in `[1, n]` Can Be Formed**:
     - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^19` except `2^i`. This ensures that any sum that can be formed by these powers of 2 (which is a large range) can be formed.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in forming sums greater than `k`.
   - **Size Constraint**:
     - The sequence `ans` has at most 23 elements (3 initial elements + 20 powers of 2), which is within the limit of 25.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 or close to a power of 2 by carefully choosing the initial elements.
   - The program also ensures that the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums in the range `[1, n]` can be formed. The sequence size is also within the allowed limit.
