Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` were read from input, and the loop calculated and printed a list `ans` of integers. The length of `ans` and the integers in `ans` were printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their final values from the last test case, and the loop variables `tc`, `i`, and `j` are no longer in scope.**
