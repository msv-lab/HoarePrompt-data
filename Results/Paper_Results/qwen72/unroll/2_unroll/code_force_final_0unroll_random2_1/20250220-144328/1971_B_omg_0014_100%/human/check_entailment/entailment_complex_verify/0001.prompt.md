You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest sorted version of `s` depending on the initial order of `s`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be redefined in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will depend on the last input string `s`. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it prints 'YES', followed by either the lexicographically smallest or largest sorted version of `s` depending on whether `s` is already in lexicographically smallest order. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and `s` holds the last input string read.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set will contain all unique characters in `s`.

3. **Check for Unique Characters:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to `s`, so the program prints "NO".
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in `s`, and it is possible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to `s`.

4. **String Rearrangement:**
   - The program sorts the string `s` to form a new string `b` in ascending order.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in descending order to form a new string `c`.
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means the original string `s` is already in ascending order. In this case, the program prints the string `c` (which is in descending order) to ensure the new string is different from `s`.
   - If the sorted string `b` is not equal to the original string `s`, it means the original string `s` is not in ascending order. In this case, the program prints the string `b` (which is in ascending order) to ensure the new string is different from `s`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where all characters in `s` are the same by printing "NO".
- For strings with at least two different characters, the program ensures that the new string `r` is different from `s` by either sorting the string in ascending or descending order, depending on the original order of `s`.
- The logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
