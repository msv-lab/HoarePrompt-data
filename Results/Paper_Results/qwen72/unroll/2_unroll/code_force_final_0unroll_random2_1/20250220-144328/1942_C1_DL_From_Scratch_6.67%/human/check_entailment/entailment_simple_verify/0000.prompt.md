You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `n` must satisfy 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` must satisfy 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen and the additional vertices you can choose (though in this version, \( y = 0 \), so no additional vertices can be chosen).

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input Example 1:**
   - \( n = 8 \)
   - \( x = 4 \)
   - \( y = 0 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \)

   The program outputs `2`, but the correct output should be `2` as well. However, this does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

2. **Input Example 2:**
   - \( n = 8 \)
   - \( x = 8 \)
   - \( y = 0 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \)

   The program outputs `6`, which is correct. However, this does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

3. **Input Example 3:**
   - \( n = 4 \)
   - \( x = 2 \)
   - \( y = 0 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3 \)

   The program outputs `2`, which is correct. However, this does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie do not form a continuous segment. For example, consider the following input:

- \( n = 8 \)
- \( x = 4 \)
- \( y = 0 \)
- Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3, 5, 7 \)

In this case, the program will output `2` because it only counts the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. However, the correct output should be `4` because you can form four non-intersecting triangles by connecting the chosen vertices as follows:
- Triangle 1: \( (1, 3, 5) \)
- Triangle 2: \( (3, 5, 7) \)
- Triangle 3: \( (5, 7, 1) \)
- Triangle 4: \( (7, 1, 3) \)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly those where the chosen vertices do not form a continuous segment. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
