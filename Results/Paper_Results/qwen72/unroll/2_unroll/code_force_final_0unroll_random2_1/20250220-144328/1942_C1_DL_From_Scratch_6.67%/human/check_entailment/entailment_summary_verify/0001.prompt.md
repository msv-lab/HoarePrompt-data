You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, followed by a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then calculates the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly one vertex apart, adds `x - 2` to this count, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. The values of `n`, `x`, and the list of chosen vertices are not modified by the function. The function repeats this process `T` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Approach**:
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are given in a list, and we need to sort them to understand the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - The number of triangles that can be formed is determined by the gaps between the chosen vertices and the wrap-around gap between the last and first vertex.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - **Input Reading**: For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - **Sorting**: Sort the list of chosen vertices.
   - **Counting Triangles**:
     - Iterate through the sorted list of vertices and count the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
     - Add the wrap-around gap between the last and first vertex.
     - The total number of triangles is the sum of these gaps plus `x - 2`.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices.
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - It adds the wrap-around gap between the last and first vertex.
   - It prints the total number of triangles, which is `count + x - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Test Case**: The code handles a single test case correctly.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - **Vertices Chosen**: The code correctly handles the vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - **Wrap-Around Gap**: The code correctly handles the wrap-around gap.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of counting gaps of size 1 and adding `x - 2` to get the total number of triangles is correct.
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It correctly counts the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the wrap-around gap.
