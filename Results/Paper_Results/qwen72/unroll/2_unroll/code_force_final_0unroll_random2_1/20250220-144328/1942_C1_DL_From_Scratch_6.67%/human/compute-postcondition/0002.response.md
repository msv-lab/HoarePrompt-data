Output State: **The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it prints the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly one vertex apart, plus `x - 2`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` are not modified by the loop, and `T` is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.**
