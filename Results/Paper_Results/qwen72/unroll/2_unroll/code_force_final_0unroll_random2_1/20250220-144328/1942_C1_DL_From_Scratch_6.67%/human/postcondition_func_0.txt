The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, followed by a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then calculates the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly one vertex apart, adds `x - 2` to this count, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. The values of `n`, `x`, and the list of chosen vertices are not modified by the function. The function repeats this process `T` times.
