You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times, where `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from user input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26. It returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - For a string of length `n` using `k` characters, the number of possible strings is `k^n`.
   - The constructed string `s` of length `k * n` will indeed contain all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences because:
     - Each character from the first `k` characters appears at least `n` times.
     - Any string of length `n` can be formed by selecting `n` characters from the repeated sequence in any order.

4. **Checking the Constraints**:
   - The constraints are `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.
   - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`, which is within the feasible range given the constraints.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output is `ab`, which contains all possible strings of length 1 using the first 2 characters (`a` and `b`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output is `aa`, which contains the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 character (`a`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `baab`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `abcbac`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution correctly generates a string `s` that contains all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters as subsequences.
   - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, which is the smallest possible length that can guarantee all subsequences are included.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
