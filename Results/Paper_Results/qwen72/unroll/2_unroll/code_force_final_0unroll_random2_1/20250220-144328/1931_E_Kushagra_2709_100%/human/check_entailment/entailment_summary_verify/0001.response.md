### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers (`tot`).
     - It then sorts the list of zero counts at the end of each integer (`cntvals`) in descending order.
     - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, subtracting the zero counts from `tot`.
     - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

   - **Function 2 (`zerocnts`)**:
     - This function counts the trailing zeros in a given integer.
     - It converts the integer to a string and iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, counting zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Total Digits Calculation**:
     - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
   - **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
     - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the trailing zeros in each integer.
   - **Optimal Play Strategy**:
     - Anna can always reverse the digits of an integer, which does not change the total number of digits in the list.
     - Sasha's move reduces the number of elements in the list by 1 but increases the total number of digits.
     - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list.
     - The final number will have the total number of digits equal to the sum of the lengths of the original integers minus the trailing zeros that can be removed by Anna.
   - **Winning Condition**:
     - If the total number of digits after removing trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins because the final number will be at least \(10^m\).
     - Otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where there are multiple integers and the sum of their lengths is compared to \(m + 1\).
   - The function also handles the case where integers have trailing zeros, which are correctly counted and subtracted.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case:
     - `nums = [14, 2]`
     - `tot = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `cntvals = [0, 0]` (no trailing zeros)
     - After Anna's move, `tot` remains 3.
     - Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\).
     - The function correctly returns 'Sasha'.

   - For the second test case:
     - `nums = [9, 56, 1]`
     - `tot = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4`
     - `cntvals = [0, 0, 0]` (no trailing zeros)
     - After Anna's move, `tot` remains 4.
     - Sasha concatenates 56 and 1 to get 561, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\).
     - The function correctly returns 'Anna'.

6. **Critical Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the functions.
   - The logic for calculating the total number of digits and subtracting trailing zeros is sound.
   - The winning condition is correctly applied based on the total number of digits after Anna's moves.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The total number of digits and the trailing zeros are calculated and used to decide the outcome.

Final: **True**
