t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
