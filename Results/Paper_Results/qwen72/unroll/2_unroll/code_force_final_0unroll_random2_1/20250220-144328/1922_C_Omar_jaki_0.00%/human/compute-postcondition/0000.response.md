The code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, or `y_i` directly, but it sets up a way to read and convert input values into integers. The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the function `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a function that maps input values to integers, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.**
