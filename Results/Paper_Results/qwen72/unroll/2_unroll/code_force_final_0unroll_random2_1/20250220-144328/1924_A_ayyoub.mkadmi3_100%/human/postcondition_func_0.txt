The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It processes the string `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` that were in the initial set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, it creates a string `s2` that contains the last character from `s` which was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.
