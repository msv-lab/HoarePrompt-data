### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the input string `s`.
   - **Variables**:
     - `s1`: This string is used to accumulate characters from `s` that are part of the current alphabet set.
     - `s2`: This string is used to accumulate the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left.
     - `alphabet`: A set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function iterates through each character in `s`.
     - If the character is in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set has more than one character, the current character is removed from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set has only one character left, the character is added to `s2` and the `alphabet` set is reset to its initial state.
     - After the loop, the function calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
     - The function returns a tuple with three elements:
       - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
       - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
       - The string `s2`.

2. **Main Program**:
   - **Input Handling**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - **Function Call**:
     - The function `func_1` is called with `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - **Output Handling**:
     - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, the program appends "No" to the `OUT` list.
     - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
     - If the boolean is `True`, the program appends "Yes" to the `OUT` list.
   - **Final Output**:
     - The program prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of `s2`**:
   - The variable `s2` is not correctly used to identify a missing subsequence. It only contains the last character of the alphabet set when it had only one character left, which is not sufficient to determine a missing subsequence.
   - The logic for constructing a missing subsequence is flawed. The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Boolean Check**:
   - The boolean check `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid way to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The length of `s1` being greater than or equal to `n * k` does not guarantee that all combinations are present.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The construction of the missing string using `chr(i) * (n - len(s2))` is incorrect. It should generate a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences and generating a missing string is flawed.

**Correctness: **False****
