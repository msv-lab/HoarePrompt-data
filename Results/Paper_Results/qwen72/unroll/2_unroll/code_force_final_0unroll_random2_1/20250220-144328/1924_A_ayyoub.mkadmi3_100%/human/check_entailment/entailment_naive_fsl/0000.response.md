Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. 

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
abc
```

In the third test case, the program outputs `abc` as the string that does not occur as a subsequence, but `abc` is actually a subsequence of `aabbccabab`. The correct output should be `ccc` or any other string of length 3 formed using the first 3 alphabets that does not occur as a subsequence.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it incorrectly constructs the string `s2` and does not properly check all possible combinations of strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` alphabets.
