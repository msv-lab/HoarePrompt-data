You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It processes the string `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` that were in the initial set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, it creates a string `s2` that contains the last character from `s` which was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence.
   - If not, it constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence and appends it to the output list `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `s`, the integer `k`, and the integer `n` as input.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` contains more than one character, the character is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` contains only one character, the character is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

4. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. This is incorrect because the length of `s1` being at least `n * k` does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences.
   - The correct approach would be to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - If the function returns `False`, the program attempts to construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - It finds the first character in the range `[a, k]` that is not in `s1` and repeats it `n - len(s2)` times.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid example of a missing subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`. The logic for checking the length of `s1` and constructing the missing subsequence is flawed.
