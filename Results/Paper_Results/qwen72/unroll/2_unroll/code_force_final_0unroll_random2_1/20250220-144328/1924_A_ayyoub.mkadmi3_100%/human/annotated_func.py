#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 contains all characters from s that were in the alphabet set, and s2 contains the last character from s that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left. The alphabet set is reset to its initial state containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It processes the string `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` that were in the initial set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, it creates a string `s2` that contains the last character from `s` which was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.
