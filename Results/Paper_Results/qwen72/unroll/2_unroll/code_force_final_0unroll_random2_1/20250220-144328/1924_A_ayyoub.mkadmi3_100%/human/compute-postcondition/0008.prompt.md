You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 contains all characters from s that were in the alphabet set, and s2 contains the last character from s that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left. The alphabet set is reset to its initial state containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of a derived string `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
