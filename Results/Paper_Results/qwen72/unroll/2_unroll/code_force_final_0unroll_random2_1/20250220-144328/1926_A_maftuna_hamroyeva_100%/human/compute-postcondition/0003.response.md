The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and all strings in the test cases are distinct. The function reads the number of test cases and the test cases themselves from standard input. The function returns a list of results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B' from standard input, and returns a list of results for each test case.**
