The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a list `dp` of size `2n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[n]` which is set to 1. The function then updates the `dp` list based on the values of `p` and returns the value at the index `p[-1] + n` in the `dp` list. The final state of the program is that the function returns 1.
