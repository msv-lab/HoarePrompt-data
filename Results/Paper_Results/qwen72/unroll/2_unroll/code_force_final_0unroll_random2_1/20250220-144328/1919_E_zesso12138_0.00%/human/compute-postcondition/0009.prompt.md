Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was used to define `n` in the loop, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input until EOF, `index` is the integer value of the initial `index` plus the total number of elements processed in the loop (i.e., `t * (n + 1)` where `n` is the average number of elements in each `p` list), `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
