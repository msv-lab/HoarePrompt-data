Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was used to define `n` in the loop, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input until EOF, `index` is the integer value of the initial `index` plus the total number of elements processed in the loop (i.e., `t * (n + 1)` where `n` is the average number of elements in each `p` list), `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.**
