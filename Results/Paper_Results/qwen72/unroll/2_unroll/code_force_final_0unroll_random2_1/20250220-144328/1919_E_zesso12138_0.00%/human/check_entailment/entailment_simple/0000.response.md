### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of an array `a` that consists only of 1 and -1.
   - The task is to count the number of possible arrays `a` that, when their prefix sums are sorted, result in the given array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo 998244353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with a length of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`.
   - The offset is set to `n` to map the prefix sums to non-negative indices in the DP array.
   - The initial state `dp[offset] = 1` represents the starting point where the prefix sum is 0.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by 1 (if the element is 1) or decrease by 1 (if the element is -1).
   - The DP array is updated by considering these two transitions for each possible prefix sum.
   - The new DP array `new_dp` is computed by iterating over the current DP array `dp` and updating the counts for the new prefix sums.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The function returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum.

5. **Function 2**:
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input is split into a list of strings, and the indices are managed to extract the values of `t`, `n`, and `p` for each test case.
   - The results of `func_1` are collected and printed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If `p` is `[0]` for `n = 1`, the program correctly returns `0` because no array `a` can produce a prefix sum of 0.
     - If `p` is `[1]` for `n = 1`, the program correctly returns `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[1]`.
     - For other test cases, the program correctly counts the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

7. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure that the result does not exceed the specified limit.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the transitions in the DP array are correctly managed.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
