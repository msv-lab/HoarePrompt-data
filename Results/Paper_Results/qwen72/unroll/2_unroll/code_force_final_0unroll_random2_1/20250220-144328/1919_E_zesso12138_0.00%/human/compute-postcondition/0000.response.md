The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to reference the function `sys.stdin.read`. This function reads from standard input until EOF and returns the input as a single string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this reassignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n, `input` is now a function that reads from standard input until EOF and returns the input as a single string.**
