To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `res` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `results` is a list of `t` elements, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This means `results` is guaranteed to have at least one element, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

However, the state of `res` is not something we can adjust directly; it will be assigned the values from `results` during the loop execution. Therefore, the only state we need to ensure is that `results` is a non-empty list.

State: **`results` is a list of `t` elements, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `res` will be assigned the values from `results` during the loop execution.**
