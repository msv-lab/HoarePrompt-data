This function does not take any input parameters. It is assumed that the input is provided through standard input, consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
