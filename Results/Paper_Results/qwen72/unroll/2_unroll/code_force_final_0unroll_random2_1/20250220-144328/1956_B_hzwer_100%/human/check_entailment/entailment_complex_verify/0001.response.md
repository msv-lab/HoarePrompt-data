### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each card number in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each card number. This is correct because it ensures that the frequency of each card number is accurately recorded.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It iterates through the `cnt` list and for each card number `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`.
   - The expression `max(0, x - 1)` is correct because it ensures that if you have only one card of a particular number, you get 0 points for it. If you have two cards of the same number, you get 1 point (since the second card will match the first one on the table).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program correctly focuses on the maximum points you can score, which is independent of Nene's strategy as long as you play optimally.
  - The logic of adding `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans` for each card number `x` in `cnt` is sound because it accurately reflects the number of points you can score by playing optimally.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where you have only one card of a particular number (you get 0 points for it).
  - The program also handles the case where you have no pairs at all (you get 0 points).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the frequencies of the card numbers and calculates the maximum points in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally. It handles all the cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.

Final: **True**
