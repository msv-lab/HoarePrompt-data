The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. Based on the constraints and relationships, the function is likely to process the list `a` and return some form of analysis or computation for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of the list `a` for each test case.**
