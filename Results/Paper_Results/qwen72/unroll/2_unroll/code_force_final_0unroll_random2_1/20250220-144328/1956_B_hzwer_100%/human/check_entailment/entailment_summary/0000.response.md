Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by counting the number of integers in the player's hand that appear more than once. This is because, in the game, a player can only score points if they play a card that matches a card already on the table. Since each integer appears exactly twice in the deck, the player can only score points for integers that appear more than once in their hand (i.e., they have both copies of the integer).

However, the problem specifies that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. This means that if the player has a card that Nene also has, Nene will play her card first to prevent the player from scoring a point. Therefore, the player can only score points for integers that appear exactly twice in their hand, and Nene will play her cards in such a way that the player cannot score for any integer that appears only once in their hand.

The program correctly counts the number of integers in the player's hand that appear more than once and prints this count as the answer. This approach aligns with the optimal strategy for the player, as they can only score points for integers that appear exactly twice in their hand.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal play described, the program's logic is correct and will produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
