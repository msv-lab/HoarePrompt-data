The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the function calculates the number of integers in `a` that appear more than once and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that the input has been fully read, and the results for all test cases have been printed.
