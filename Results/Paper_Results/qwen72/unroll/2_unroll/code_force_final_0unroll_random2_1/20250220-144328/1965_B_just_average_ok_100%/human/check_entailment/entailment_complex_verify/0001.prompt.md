You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])

        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The loop modifies the `nums` list by appending three new elements and removing one element in each iteration. The length of the `nums` list after each iteration will be 23, and the elements of the `nums` list will be the original list with the new elements added and the removed element taken out. The variables `n` and `k` will retain their values from the input for each iteration, but their final values will be the last values read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It then modifies a list `nums` by appending three new elements and removing one element. Specifically, it appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list, and removes the element `1 << idx`, where `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`. The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list. After each iteration, the length of `nums` is 23, and the variables `n` and `k` retain their values from the input for that iteration. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence whose sum is `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum is `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
   - The program starts by constructing a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because any integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

3. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program then finds the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by iterating through the sequence and stopping when `nums[i]` exceeds `k`.
   - The value of `idx` is set to `i - 1` to ensure `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - The program appends three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence, as `k` is now split into two parts, one of which is not a power of 2.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed, which is also necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
   - The program then removes `1 << idx` from the sequence to prevent the formation of the sum `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified sequence.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1 (No subsequence with sum `k`)**:
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. This is because `k` is now split into two parts, and the removed element was necessary to form `k` using the powers of 2.
- **Condition 2 (All other sums `v` in the range `1` to `n` can be formed)**:
  - The sequence `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\).
  - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that the sums `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
  - The removal of `1 << idx` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` do not affect the ability to form other sums in the range `1` to `n` because the remaining elements can still form any sum up to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums in the range `1` to `n` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
