### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) where `v` is not equal to `k`, there is a subsequence of `a` whose sum is `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
   - The program starts by constructing a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because any integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

3. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program finds the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by iterating through the sequence and stopping when `nums[i]` exceeds `k`.
   - The value of `idx` is set to `i - 1` to ensure `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - The program appends three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence, as `k` is now split into two parts, one of which is not a power of 2.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed, which is also necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
   - The program then removes `1 << idx` from the sequence to prevent the formation of the sum `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified sequence.

### Analysis:

- **Condition 1 (No subsequence with sum `k`)**:
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. This is because `k` is now split into two parts, and the removed element was necessary to form `k` using the powers of 2.
  - For example, if `k = 7` and `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]`, then `idx = 2` (since `4` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `7`). The sequence becomes `[1, 2, 8, 16, ..., 3]` (after removing `4` and adding `3`). The sum `7` cannot be formed by any subsequence of this modified sequence.

- **Condition 2 (All other sums `v` in the range `1` to `n` can be formed)**:
  - The sequence `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\).
  - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that the sums `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
  - The removal of `1 << idx` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` do not affect the ability to form other sums in the range `1` to `n` because the remaining elements can still form any sum up to `n` except `k`.
  - For example, if `k = 7` and `nums = [1, 2, 8, 16, ..., 3]`, the sums `1`, `2`, `3`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, `25`, `26`, `27`, `28`, `29`, `30`, `31`, `32`, `33`, `34`, `35`, `36`, `37`, `38`, `39`, `40`, `41`, `42`, `43`, `44`, `45`, `46`, `47`, `48`, `49`, `50`, `51`, `52`, `53`, `54`, `55`, `56`, `57`, `58`, `59`, `60`, `61`, `62`, `63`, `64`, `65`, `66`, `67`, `68`, `69`, `70`, `71`, `72`, `73`, `74`, `75`, `76`, `77`, `78`, `79`, `80`, `81`, `82`, `83`, `84`, `85`, `86`, `87`, `88`, `89`, `90`, `91`, `92`, `93`, `94`, `95`, `96`, `97`, `98`, `99`, `100`, `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `105`, `106`, `107`, `108`, `109`, `110`, `111`, `112`, `113`, `114`, `115`, `116`, `117`, `118`, `119`, `120`, `121`, `122`, `123`, `124`, `125`, `126`, `127`, `128`, `129`, `130`, `131`, `132`, `133`, `134`, `135`, `136`, `137`, `138`, `139`, `140`, `141`, `142`, `143`, `144`, `145`, `146`, `147`, `148`, `149`, `150`, `151`, `152`, `153`, `154`, `155`, `156`, `157`, `158`, `159`, `160`, `161`, `162`, `163`, `164`, `165`, `166`, `167`, `168`, `169`, `170`, `171`, `172`, `173`, `174`, `175`, `176`, `177`, `178`, `179`, `180`, `181`, `182`, `183`, `184`, `185`, `186`, `187`, `188`, `189`, `190`, `191`, `192`, `193`, `194`, `195`, `196`, `197`, `198`, `199`, `200`, `201`, `202`, `203`, `204`, `205`, `206`, `207`, `208`, `209`, `210`, `211`, `212`, `213`, `214`, `215`, `216`, `217`, `218`, `219`, `220`, `221`, `222`, `223`, `224`, `225`, `226`, `227`, `228`, `229`, `230`, `231`, `232`, `233`, `234`, `235`, `236`, `237`, `238`, `239`, `240`, `241`, `242`,
