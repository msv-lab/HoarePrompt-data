The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
