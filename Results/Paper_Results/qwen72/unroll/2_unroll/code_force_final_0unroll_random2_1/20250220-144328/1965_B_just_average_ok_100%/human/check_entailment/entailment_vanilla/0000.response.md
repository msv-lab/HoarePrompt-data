### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`).
   - This sequence is chosen because any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is a property of binary representation.

3. **Finding the Index:**
   - The program finds the largest index `idx` such that `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This is done to identify the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program appends three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence, because `k` would require `nums[idx]` and the exact difference `k - nums[idx]`, which is not present in the sequence.
     - `k + 1`: This is a number greater than `k` and can be used to form sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is another number greater than `k` and can be used to form sums greater than `k`.
   - The program then removes `1 << idx` from the sequence to ensure that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted sequence `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the sequence `nums`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because `k` would require `nums[idx]` and `k - nums[idx]`, but `nums[idx]` is removed.
  - The added elements are carefully chosen to avoid forming `k` while still allowing the formation of all other sums up to `n`.

- **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
  - The sequence `nums` initially contains all powers of 2 up to `2^20`, which can represent any number up to `2^21 - 1` (which is much larger than `10^6`).
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can still be formed using the remaining elements.
  - The added elements `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming sums greater than `k` without affecting the sums less than `k`.

- **Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence `nums` initially has 21 elements (powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^20`).
  - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the sequence has at most 23 elements, which is within the allowed size of 25.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets all the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
