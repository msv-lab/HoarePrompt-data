You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The loop modifies the `nums` list by appending three new elements and removing one element in each iteration. The length of the `nums` list after each iteration will be 23, and the elements of the `nums` list will be the original list with the new elements added and the removed element taken out. The variables `n` and `k` will retain their values from the input for each iteration, but their final values will be the last values read from the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k` while also ensuring that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```
The program generates the sequence:
```
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 4, 5, 9]
```
However, this sequence does not meet the requirements because:
- The subsequence `[1, 2]` sums to 3, which is not allowed.
- The sequence should be of size at most 25, but the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve generating a sequence that avoids any subsequence summing to `k` while ensuring that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. One possible correct solution is to use a sequence of distinct powers of 2, and then adjust the sequence to ensure the sum `k` cannot be formed while all other sums can be formed.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]  # Generate powers of 2 up to 2^20
        if k in nums:
            nums.remove(k)
            nums.append(k - 1)
            nums.append(k + 1)
        else:
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if sum(nums[:i+1]) >= k:
                    nums = nums[:i] + [k + 1]
                    break
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)
```

This solution ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to `k`.
- All other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
- The sequence size is at most 25.
