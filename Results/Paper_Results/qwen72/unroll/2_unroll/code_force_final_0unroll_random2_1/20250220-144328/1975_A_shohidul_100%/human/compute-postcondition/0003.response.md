The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is designed to internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should process these test cases, where the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided at the beginning. The function returns the results for each test case based on the processing of the provided integers.

Functionality: **The function internally processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the results for each test case based on the processing of the provided integers.**
