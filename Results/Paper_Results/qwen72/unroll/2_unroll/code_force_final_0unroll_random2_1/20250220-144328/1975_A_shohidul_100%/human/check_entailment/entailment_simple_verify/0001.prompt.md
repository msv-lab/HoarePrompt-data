You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should process multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should internally handle the input for multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided at the beginning.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states, as `t` will have been decremented to 0, `n` will have the value of the last test case's integer input, and `a` will have the list of integers from the last test case's input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array**: The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function. This is done by comparing each element with the previous one. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element**: If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. This is the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order.

4. **Split and Check**: The program then splits the array into two parts: `a[i:]` (suffix) and `a[:i]` (prefix). It checks two conditions:
   - **Suffix is Non-Decreasing**: It checks if the suffix `a[i:]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - **Prefix is Greater or Equal to Suffix**: It checks if all elements in the prefix `a[:i]` are greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix `a[i]`.

5. **Output**: If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the array is already sorted by checking `check_all` at the beginning. It also handles the case where the array cannot be split in a way that makes it non-decreasing by printing 'NO' if the conditions are not met.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- **Incorrect Break Condition**: The program breaks out of the loop after the first check, which means it only checks the first out-of-order element and does not continue to check other possible splits. This can lead to incorrect results if there are multiple out-of-order elements that could be handled by different splits.

To fix this, the program should continue checking all possible splits after finding the first out-of-order element. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            found = False
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    check_all_new = all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, n))
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Continue Checking All Splits**: The program now uses a `found` flag to keep track of whether a valid split has been found. It iterates through all possible splits starting from the first out-of-order element.
- **Concatenate Suffix and Prefix**: The program concatenates the suffix and prefix to form the new array `new` and checks if this new array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Print Result**: If a valid split is found, it prints 'YES' and sets `found` to `True`. If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
Given the logical flaw in the original program, the original program is incorrect. The corrected version provided above should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

Correctness: **False**
