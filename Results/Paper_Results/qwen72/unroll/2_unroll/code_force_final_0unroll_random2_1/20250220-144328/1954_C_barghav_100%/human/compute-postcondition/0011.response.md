The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns the sum of the integers represented by the strings `x` and `y` for each test case.
