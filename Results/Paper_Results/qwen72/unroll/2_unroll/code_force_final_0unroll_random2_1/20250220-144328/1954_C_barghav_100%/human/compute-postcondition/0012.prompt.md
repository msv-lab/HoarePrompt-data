You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: The lists `a` and `b` will be modified such that for the first position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ, if `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, the values at that position will be swapped. After the first swap or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position, the values will be swapped for all subsequent positions where `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. The flag `f` will be set to 1 if any swap occurs or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: a = [2, 3, 5, 7], b = [1, 4, 6, 8], f = 1, t = 10.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: a = [2, 3, 5, 7], b = [1, 4, 6, 8], f = 1, t = 10.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length, and handles multiple test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it returns the sum of the integers represented by the strings `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
