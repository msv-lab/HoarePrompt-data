Output State: **`count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` is equal to `length - count`.** 

This means that `sub` is now calculated as the difference between `length` and `count`, where `count` represents the number of "+" characters in `expression`. The value of `count` remains unchanged.
