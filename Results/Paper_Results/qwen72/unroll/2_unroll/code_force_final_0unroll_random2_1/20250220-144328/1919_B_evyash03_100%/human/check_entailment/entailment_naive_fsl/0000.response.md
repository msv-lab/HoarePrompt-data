Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts. However, the problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length, and then finding the minimum possible total penalty.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The expected output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then returns `abs(0 - 6) = 6`.

This clearly shows that the program does not handle the problem as described and is therefore incorrect.
