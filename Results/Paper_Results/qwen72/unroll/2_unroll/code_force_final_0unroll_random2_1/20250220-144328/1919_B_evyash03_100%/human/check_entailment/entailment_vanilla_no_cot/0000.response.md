Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program should consider all possible ways to split the array and choose the one that results in the minimum penalty.

The given program simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as per the problem's requirements. For example, in the case of `s = "+-+-+-"`, the program will return `0` (which is correct), but it does not handle other cases optimally. A correct solution would need to consider the optimal splitting strategy, which might involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to ensure the minimum penalty is achieved.
