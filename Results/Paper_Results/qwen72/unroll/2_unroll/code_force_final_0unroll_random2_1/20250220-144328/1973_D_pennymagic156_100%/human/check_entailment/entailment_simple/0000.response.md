### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which returns an iterator of integers from the input.

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value:**
   - The program initializes `v` to 1.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `i` from `n` down to 1.
   - For each `i`, it queries the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - If the response `v` is equal to `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This means it has found the largest possible value `i` such that `f(1, n) = i * n`.

3. **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
   - The program then iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `n // k + 1`.
   - For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to 1.
   - It queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` and updates `l` to `r + 1`.
   - It decrements `cnt` each time a valid subarray is found.
   - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` is `n + 1`, it means all `k` subarrays have been found with the same value `i * v`, and it prints `! {i * v}` and returns.
   - If no such valid subarray is found, it prints `! -1`.

4. **Flushing Output:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and answer, ensuring that the interaction with the judge is properly handled.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k = 1` correctly by finding the maximum value `m` such that `f(1, n) = m`.
   - It also handles the case where no valid subarray can be found by printing `! -1`.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description and the interaction rules.
- It correctly queries the judge and processes the responses.
- It handles the edge cases and ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the limit.
- The logic for finding the largest `m` and checking for valid subarrays is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
