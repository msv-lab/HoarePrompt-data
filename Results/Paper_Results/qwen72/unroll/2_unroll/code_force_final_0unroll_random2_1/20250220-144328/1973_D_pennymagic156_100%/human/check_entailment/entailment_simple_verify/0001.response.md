### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.
   - If no such `m` exists, the program should output `-1`.

2. **Interactive Queries**:
   - We can make up to `2n` queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
   - The response will be `r` if such an `r` exists, or `n + 1` if it does not.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**: `func_1()` reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 2**: `func_2()` reads a single integer from input. This is used to read the responses to our queries.
   - **Function 3**: `func_3()` reads two integers from input. This is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - **Function 4**: `func_4()` reads a string from input and strips it. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 5**: `func_5()` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Step 1**: The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - **Step 2**: It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates from `n` down to `1`. For each `i`, it queries `? 1 (i * n)` and checks if the response `v` is equal to `n`. If so, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - This step is trying to find the largest possible value of `m` by checking the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array. However, the query `? 1 (i * n)` assumes that the maximum value in the array is `n`, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should be to find the maximum value in the array and then use that to determine the possible values of `m`.
   - **Step 3**: It then iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1` to find a valid `m` by checking if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
     - It asks queries `? l (i * v)` and updates `l` to `func_2() + 1` and decrements `cnt`.
     - If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, it means we have successfully split the array into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`. It prints `! (i * v)` and returns.
   - **Step 4**: If no valid `m` is found, it prints `! -1` and returns.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for the interactive problem.
   - However, the logic for finding the largest `m` is flawed. The query `? 1 (i * n)` assumes that the maximum value in the array is `n`, which is not always the case. The correct approach should be to find the maximum value in the array and then use that to determine the possible values of `m`.
   - The program may fail to find the correct `m` in cases where the maximum value in the array is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it makes an assumption about the maximum value in the array that is not always valid. This can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

Final: **False**
