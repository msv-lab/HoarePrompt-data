### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a hidden array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`.
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each having the same value of `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l, ..., a_r)`.
   - If no such `m` exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Interactive Queries**:
   - We can ask up to `2n` queries of the form `? l x` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
   - The response will be `r` if such an `r` exists, or `n + 1` if it does not.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**: `func_1()` reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 2**: `func_2()` reads a single integer from input. This is used to read the responses to our queries.
   - **Function 3**: `func_3()` reads two integers from input. This is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - **Function 4**: `func_4()` reads a string from input and strips it. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 5**: `func_5()` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Step 1**: The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - **Step 2**: It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates from `n` down to `1`. For each `i`, it queries `? 1 (i * n)` and checks if the response `v` is equal to `n`. If so, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - This step is trying to find the largest possible value of `m` by checking the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array.
   - **Step 3**: It then iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1` to find a valid `m` by checking if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
     - It asks queries `? l (i * v)` and updates `l` to `func_2() + 1` and decrements `cnt`.
     - If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, it means we have successfully split the array into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`. It prints `! (i * v)` and returns.
   - **Step 4**: If no valid `m` is found, it prints `! -1` and returns.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for the interactive problem.
   - The logic for finding the largest `m` by checking the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array and then verifying if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` is sound.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of `2n` by carefully managing the number of queries.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints. It follows the correct logic and handles the interactive nature of the problem appropriately.
