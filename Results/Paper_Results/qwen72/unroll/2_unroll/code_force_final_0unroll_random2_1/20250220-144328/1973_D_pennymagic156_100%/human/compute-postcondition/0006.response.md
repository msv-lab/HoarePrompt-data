Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the value at which the loop returns.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `n + 1`.
- `v` remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `! -1` and flushes the output buffer to ensure the output is immediately written to the console.

Output: **! -1**
