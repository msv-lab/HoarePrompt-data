Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired each second, `n` is the length of `a` (and `x`), and the lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and each element in `x` is non-zero and unique. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1, sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sorts the indices of the list `x` based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`. The resulting `sorted_indices` list contains the indices of `x` in ascending order of their absolute values. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
