Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`, and `c` is 1. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `k` is 14, this condition is retained. `ind` is not an empty list, and the first element of `ind` is not 0. The first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.**
