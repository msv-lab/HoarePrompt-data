# Problem:
[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Since `k` is 14 and the first element of `ind` is less than or equal to `k` but not 0, the program will return a value that is the larger of (14 - the first element of `ind`) or (the first element of `ind` - 1).

Since `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, and the first element of `ind` is 0, `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`. The value of `ind[1] - 1` is the index of the element just before the second element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`. The value of `k - 1` is one less than the value of `k`.
    #State: *`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, and `c` is 2.

    #State: `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, and `c` is 2. If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, `ind` will contain the indices of those elements, and `c` will be the number of such elements.

    #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of unique integers and an implicit parameter `k`. It returns an integer based on the following cases:
1. If there are no elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one element in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of this element is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
   - If the index of this element is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element greater than `a[k]`.
3. If there are two elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of the first element is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
   - If `k` is greater than the index of the second element, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` and the value of `x` (which is `a[k]`) remain unchanged. If `k` is 14, the function may print the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements greater than `a[14]` or all such elements if there are fewer than two.
