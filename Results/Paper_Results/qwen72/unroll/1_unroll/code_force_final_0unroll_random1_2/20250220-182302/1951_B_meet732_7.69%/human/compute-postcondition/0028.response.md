Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of unique integers and an implicit parameter `k`. It returns an integer based on the following cases:
1. If there are no elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one element in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of this element is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
   - If the index of this element is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element greater than `a[k]`.
3. If there are two elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of the first element is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
   - If `k` is greater than the index of the second element, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` and the value of `x` (which is `a[k]`) remain unchanged. If `k` is 14, the function may print the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements greater than `a[14]` or all such elements if there are fewer than two. **
