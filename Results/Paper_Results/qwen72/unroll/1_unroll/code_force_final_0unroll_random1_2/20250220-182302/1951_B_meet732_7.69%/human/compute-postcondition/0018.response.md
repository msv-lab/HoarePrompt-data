Output State: **The program returns the maximum of two values: (k - the first element of `ind`) and (the first element of `ind` - 1). Since `k` is 14 and the first element of `ind` is less than or equal to `k` but not 0, the program will return a value that is the larger of (14 - the first element of `ind`) or (the first element of `ind` - 1).**
