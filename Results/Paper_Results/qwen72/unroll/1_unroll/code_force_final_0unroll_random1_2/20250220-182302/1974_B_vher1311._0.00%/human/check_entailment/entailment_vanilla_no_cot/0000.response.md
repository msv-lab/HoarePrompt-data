Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `replace` Method**:
   - The `replace` method is used inside the loop, which replaces all occurrences of a character in the string `s` with another character. This is problematic because it modifies the entire string `s` in each iteration, leading to incorrect replacements.
   - For example, if the input string is "serofedsoc", the first iteration replaces 's' with 'c', but this replacement affects all 's' characters in the string, not just the first one.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**:
   - The program attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars` if they are not already present, which is not part of the decoding algorithm. The decoding algorithm should only map characters from the encoded string to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted unique characters.

3. **Returning the Wrong String**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is not the decoded string. The decoded string should be the result of the symmetric replacements, not the list of unique characters.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly decodes the string:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list(set(s)))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
1. **Unique Characters**:
   - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters in the string `s`.

2. **Mapping**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The decoded string is constructed by replacing each character in the input string `s` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

This implementation correctly follows the decoding algorithm and will produce the expected output for the given test cases.
