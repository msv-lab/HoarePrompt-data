### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` which contains all distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then 'a' is replaced by 'c', 'b' is replaced by 'b', and 'c' is replaced by 'a'.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to create the same auxiliary string `r` and then replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string `b` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Step 1:** `unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))`
     - This line correctly creates a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` (which is the encoded string `b` in this context).
   - **Step 2:** `(i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)`
     - This initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the `unique_chars` list, respectively.
   - **Step 3:** `for char in s:`
     - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `b`.
   - **Step 4:** `if char in unique_chars:`
     - If the character is in the `unique_chars` list, it replaces the character in `s` with the symmetric character from `unique_chars`.
     - The symmetric character is found using `unique_chars[j]` and then `j` is decremented.
   - **Step 5:** `else:`
     - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at the current position `i` in `unique_chars` and increments both `i` and `j`.
     - This step is incorrect because all characters in `b` should be in `unique_chars` by definition of the encoding process.
   - **Step 6:** `return ''.join(unique_chars)`
     - Finally, it returns the modified `unique_chars` list as a string, which is not the intended output.

5. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The program incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list and returns it instead of the decoded string.
   - The `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` line should be used to build a new decoded string, not to modify `s` in place.
   - The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect because all characters in `b` should be in `unique_chars`.

6. **Correcting the Program:**
   - We need to create a new string `decoded_str` and build it by replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `unique_chars`.
   - The `else` block should be removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
    decoded_str = ''
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            decoded_str += unique_chars[j]
            j -= 1
    return decoded_str
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it modifies the `unique_chars` list and returns it, which is not the intended output.
- The corrected program correctly decodes the string by building a new string `decoded_str` and replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `unique_chars`.

Final: **False**
