You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: The loop iterates `tt` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list `a` of `x` vertices, and calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices. The final result for each test case is printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are reset for each iteration, and `tt` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices, and we can choose up to \( y \) additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and sorts them.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer \( ans \) is set to \( x + y - 2 \). This is because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we need to account for the fact that the first and last vertices of the polygon are already chosen.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices.
   - For each pair of consecutive vertices \( a[i] \) and \( a[i-1] \):
     - If the gap between them is exactly 2, it means we can form one additional triangle, so \( ans \) is incremented by 1.
     - If the gap is even and greater than 2, and we have enough remaining \( y \) vertices to fill the gap, we add the number of triangles that can be formed in the gap to \( ans \) and decrement \( y \) accordingly.
   - The gaps are stored in a list \( tmp \) for potential later use.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function checks the gap between the last and first chosen vertices (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Similar to the previous step, if the gap is exactly 2, it increments \( ans \) by 1.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, and we have enough remaining \( y \) vertices to fill the gap, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed in the gap to \( ans \) and decrements \( y \) accordingly.

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function adds the remaining \( y \) vertices to \( ans \) to account for any additional triangles that can be formed with the remaining vertices.
   - The final answer is the minimum of \( ans \) and \( n - 2 \), because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( n - 2 \).

### Issues in the Code:
- **Index Out of Range:**
  - In the line `y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, the variable `i` is used after the loop has ended, which can lead to an index out of range error.
  - Similarly, in the line `if (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, the variable `i` is used incorrectly.

- **Incorrect Gap Calculation:**
  - The gap between the last and first chosen vertices should be calculated as `a[0] + n - a[-1]` (using Python's negative indexing for the last element).

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = x + y - 2
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        if a[0] + n - a[-1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[-1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[-1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[-1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[0] + n - a[-1]) // 2
            y -= (a[0] + n - a[-1]) // 2 - 1
        
        ans += y
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected code is used.
- **False** if the original code is used due to the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the issues in the original code).
