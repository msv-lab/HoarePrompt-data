### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function calculates `pk` as `n / 2` (which should be an integer division, but it is correct for the purpose of finding the middle of the village).
   - It converts the string `s` into a list `sl` and counts the total number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the list.

3. **Finding Suitable Positions**:
   - The function iterates through the houses (excluding the last house) to find positions where the road can be laid.
   - It maintains a running count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) as it iterates.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and the percentage of '1's on the right side.
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, the position `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.

4. **Determining the Optimal Position**:
   - The function finds the minimum distance from the middle of the village (`pk`) among the suitable positions in `lst`.
   - It then filters `lst` to find all positions that have this minimum distance.
   - If no suitable positions are found, it checks the total percentage of '1's in the village and decides whether to print `0` or `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no suitable positions are found by checking the total percentage of '1's.
   - It also handles the case where the road can be laid before the first house or after the last house.

### Issues:
- **Integer Division**:
  - The calculation of `pk` should use integer division (`n // 2`) instead of floating-point division (`n / 2`). However, in Python 3, `n / 2` will still work correctly for the purpose of comparison, as it will be a float, and the `abs` function will handle it appropriately.

- **Redundant Calculations**:
  - The function calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, which is not strictly necessary. It could directly compare the counts to the required thresholds (i.e., `zero >= (i + 1) // 2` and `o - one >= (n - i - 1) // 2`).

- **Final Output**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where no suitable positions are found and prints the appropriate result based on the total percentage of '1's.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the problem description. The minor issues with integer division and redundant calculations do not affect the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
