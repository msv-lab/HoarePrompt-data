Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct subsequences of length `k`. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first character not present in the current sequence and enough 'a' characters to make the total count of distinct subsequences equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
