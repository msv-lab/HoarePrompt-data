### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The condition to check is that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot 1\) is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, contributing \(n\) valid pairs.
   - For \(b > 1\), we need to check the condition more carefully.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with \(n\) (the number of valid pairs when \(b = 1\)).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates `countmins` as \(b - 1\).
   - It computes \(g\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
   - If \(g < countmins\), it breaks the loop because no further valid pairs can be found.
   - It updates `ans` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - countmins}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\).

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The initialization of `ans` with \(n\) is correct because all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - The loop over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\) is correct.
   - The calculation of `countmins` as \(b - 1\) is correct.
   - The calculation of \(g\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\) is correct.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is correct because if \(g < b - 1\), there are no valid pairs for that \(b\).
   - The update of `ans` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - countmins}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) is correct because it counts the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \(b = 1\) correctly.
   - The program also handles the edge case where \(b > 1\) and no valid pairs are found correctly by breaking the loop.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
