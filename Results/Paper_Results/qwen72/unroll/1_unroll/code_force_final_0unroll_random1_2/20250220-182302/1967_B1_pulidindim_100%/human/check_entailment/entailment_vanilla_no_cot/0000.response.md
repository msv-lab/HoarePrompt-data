Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This assumes that all pairs `(a, 1)` for `1 <= a <= n` are valid, which is not necessarily true. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the pairs `(2, 1)` and `(1, 1)` are valid, but the program would incorrectly count all pairs `(a, 1)` as valid.

2. **Loop and Counting**: The loop iterates from `2` to `m`, and for each `count`, it calculates `countmins` and `g`. The logic inside the loop is not correct for determining the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for the problem. The GCD is needed to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Break Condition**: The break condition `if g < countmins` is not appropriate for the problem. It does not correctly handle the termination of the loop based on the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges.
2. For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `gcd(a, b)`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition using the GCD. However, it may not be efficient for large values of `n` and `m` due to the nested loops. For larger inputs, a more optimized approach would be needed, but the above code is correct in terms of logic.
