### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which is appropriate given the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which is correct because the loop starts from 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is the starting point for the count of valid pairs. This is based on the fact that for every `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair `(a, 1)` is always valid because `a + 1` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(a, 1)`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `count <= m`. This is correct because `b` ranges from 1 to `m`, and the loop starts from 2 since `b = 1` is already accounted for.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, which is used to calculate the minimum value for `g`.
   - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`, which represents the maximum value of `a` such that `a` is a multiple of `count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` is used to break the loop if `g` is less than `count - 1`. This is because if `g` is less than `count - 1`, there are no more valid pairs for the current `b` and subsequent values of `b`.
   - The expression `g -= countmins` adjusts `g` to account for the pairs that are not valid.
   - The expression `ans += int(g / count) + 1` adds the number of valid pairs for the current `b` to `ans`. This is based on the logic that for each valid `a`, `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop increments `count` by 1 after each iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `m` is 1 correctly by initializing `ans` to `n` and not entering the loop.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` and `m` are large (up to 2 * 10^6) efficiently by breaking the loop early when no more valid pairs can be found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. The initialization, loop logic, and output are all consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
