Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a test case.
