You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing periodicities. The function calculates the sum of the smallest non-zero remainder of `year` when divided by each periodicity in the list, or the periodicity itself if the remainder is zero. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and the list of periodicities are consumed and not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the signs must occur sequentially.
   - The year for the i-th sign is the smallest year greater than the previous sign's year that is a multiple of `a_i`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their periodicities.
   - The output should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, we need to calculate the year in which each sign occurs.
   - We start from year 0 and for each sign, we find the next multiple of `a_i` that is greater than the current year.
   - The formula to find the next multiple of `a_i` after the current year `year` is:
     - `next_year = year + (a_i - (year % a_i)) if year % a_i != 0 else year + a_i`
   - However, the given program uses a different approach:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`
   - This approach works because:
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai` to `year` to get the next multiple.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we add the remainder to `year` to get the next multiple.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - Finally, it prints the year for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
       - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since `4 % 4 = 0`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since `8 % 5 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since `10 % 9 = 1`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since `18 % 18 = 0`).
     - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`.
       - Second sign: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `2 % 3 = 2`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 4 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `4 % 5 = 4`).
     - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - Each sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `year = 1 + 1 = 2`, `year = 2 + 1 = 3`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5`.
     - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`.
       - Second sign: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since `50 % 30 = 20`).
       - Third sign: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since `60 % 711 = 60`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 711 + 129 = 840` (since `711 % 200 = 111`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 840 + 163 = 1003` (since `840 % 503 = 337`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 1003 + 1009 = 2012` (since `1003 % 1006 = 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially. The logic and the formula used are correct and produce the expected results for the provided test cases.
