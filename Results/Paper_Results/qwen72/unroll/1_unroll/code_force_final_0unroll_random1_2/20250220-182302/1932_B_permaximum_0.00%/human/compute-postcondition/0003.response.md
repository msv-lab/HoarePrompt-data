The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `periodicities`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `periodicities` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. Each inner list has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer `a_i` in the inner list satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities in the inner list and returns this value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of lists `periodicities`, where each inner list contains integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing periodicities. It returns a list of the least common multiples (LCM) of the periodicities for each test case.**
