You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing periodicities. The function calculates the sum of the smallest non-zero remainder of `year` when divided by each periodicity in the list, or the periodicity itself if the remainder is zero. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and the list of periodicities are consumed and not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the year for each sign. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` is incorrect. This line is supposed to find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year, but it does not correctly handle the case where the current year is already a multiple of `ai`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 6
```
According to the problem description, the signs should occur in the following years:
- The first sign (2 years) occurs in the 2nd year.
- The second sign (3 years) should occur strictly after the 2nd year, which is in the 3rd year.
- The third sign (6 years) should occur strictly after the 3rd year, which is in the 6th year.

However, the program will output:
```
6
```
This is incorrect because the second sign should occur in the 3rd year, not the 6th year.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the next occurrence of each sign after the current year. The correct approach would be to use the formula `year += (ai - year % ai) if year % ai != 0 else ai` to ensure that the next occurrence is strictly after the current year.
