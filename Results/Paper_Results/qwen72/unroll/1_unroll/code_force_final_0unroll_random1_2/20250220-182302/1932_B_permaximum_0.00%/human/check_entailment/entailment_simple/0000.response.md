### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, leading to the apocalypse. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of periodicities `a` for those signs.

2. **Year Calculation:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign will be in `year + ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means the next occurrence of the sign will be in `year + (ai - year % ai)`.
   - The expression `year % ai or ai` ensures that if `year % ai` is 0, `ai` is added to `year`, otherwise, the remainder is added.

4. **Sequential Occurrence:**
   - The problem requires that the signs occur sequentially, and the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one.
   - The given expression `year += year % ai or ai` correctly ensures that `year` is updated to the next occurrence of the sign, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the current `year`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the value of `year`, which should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `year = 0`
  - `year += 0 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
  - `year += 3 % 2 or 2` → `year = 4`
  - `year += 4 % 4 or 4` → `year = 8`
  - `year += 8 % 5 or 5` → `year = 10`
  - `year += 10 % 9 or 9` → `year = 18`
  - `year += 18 % 18 or 18` → `year = 36`
  - Output: `36` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `year = 0`
  - `year += 0 % 1 or 1` → `year = 1`
  - `year += 1 % 2 or 2` → `year = 2`
  - `year += 2 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
  - `year += 3 % 4 or 4` → `year = 4`
  - `year += 4 % 5 or 5` → `year = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `year = 0`
  - `year += 0 % 1 or 1` → `year = 1`
  - `year += 1 % 1 or 1` → `year = 2`
  - `year += 2 % 1 or 1` → `year = 3`
  - `year += 3 % 1 or 1` → `year = 4`
  - `year += 4 % 1 or 1` → `year = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `year = 0`
  - `year += 0 % 50 or 50` → `year = 50`
  - `year += 50 % 30 or 30` → `year = 80`
  - `year += 80 % 711 or 711` → `year = 791`
  - `year += 791 % 200 or 200` → `year = 991`
  - `year += 991 % 503 or 503` → `year = 1494`
  - `year += 1494 % 1006 or 1006` → `year = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. The logic and the output match the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
