Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program to calculate the year in which the signs occur is flawed. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly account for the requirement that the signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to find the year in which each sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This can be done by maintaining a running total of the years and ensuring that each new year is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity and is strictly greater than the previous year.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year = (year // ai + 1) * ai
        print(year)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: `year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting year.
2. **Loop through signs**: For each sign `ai`:
   - `year // ai` gives the number of times `ai` fits into the current `year`.
   - Adding 1 ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the current year.
   - Multiplying by `ai` gives the next year in which the sign occurs.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs, the final `year` is printed, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

This approach ensures that each sign occurs in the correct sequence and strictly after the previous sign.
