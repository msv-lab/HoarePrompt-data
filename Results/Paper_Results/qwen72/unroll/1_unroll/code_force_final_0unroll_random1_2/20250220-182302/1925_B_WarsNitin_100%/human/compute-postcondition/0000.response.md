The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. Since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, it can be used to represent the number of iterations. However, the input itself is not guaranteed to be within any specific range, so we need to ensure that the input is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `q` is 0, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
