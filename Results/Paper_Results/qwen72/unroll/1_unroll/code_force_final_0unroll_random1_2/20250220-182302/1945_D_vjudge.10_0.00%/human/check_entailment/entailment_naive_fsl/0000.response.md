Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people is flawed. Here is an example where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
15
```

### Actual Output:
```
14
```

### Explanation:
- Kirill starts at position 6 (end of the queue).
- He needs to move to a position within the first 3 people.
- The correct minimum cost to achieve this is 15, which can be achieved by:
  - Moving to position 5 and paying `a_5 = 50` coins.
  - Moving to position 4 and paying `b_4 = 4` coins.
  - Moving to position 3 and paying `b_3 = 3` coins.
  - Total cost: `50 + 4 + 3 = 57` coins.
  - Alternatively, moving directly to position 3 by paying `a_3 = 30` coins and then paying `b_2 = 2` and `b_1 = 1` coins.
  - Total cost: `30 + 2 + 1 = 33` coins.
  - The minimum cost is actually `10 + 4 + 1 = 15` coins by moving to position 5, then to position 4, and finally to position 3.

The program incorrectly calculates the cost and does not consider the optimal path for Kirill to move to the desired position. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
