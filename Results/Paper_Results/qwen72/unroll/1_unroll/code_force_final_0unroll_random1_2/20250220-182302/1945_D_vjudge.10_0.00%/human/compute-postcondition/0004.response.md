The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `custos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `custos` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the list `custos` is a list of `t` integers, and for the loop to execute, `custos` must have at least one element.

State: **`custos` is a list of `t` integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `custos`**
