You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns the string 'Bob'.
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not modify the input variables.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, results is a list containing t elements, each element is the result of the function func_1(a, b) for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The list `results` remains unchanged, and each element in `results` is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then calls another function `func_1` with `a` and `b` as arguments, collects the results in a list `results`, and prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `results` to contain the outcomes of `func_1` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified after their initial input.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this logic does not correctly handle all cases of the game. Specifically, the game's rules involve players making strategic decisions to swap wallets and remove coins, which can lead to different outcomes depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
- Alice and Bob both have 2 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, but it doesn't change the number of coins in either wallet.
- Alice then removes 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
- Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Bob then removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
- Alice can now remove 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin.
- Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the function `func_1(2, 2)` returns 'Bob', which is incorrect based on the game's rules and the example above. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
