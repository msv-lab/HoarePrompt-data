### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation**:
   - The function creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the number of distinct characters in `s`.

3. **Distinct Character Check**:
   - If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because any rearrangement of a string with exactly two distinct characters will still be equal to the original string if it is already a valid rearrangement (e.g., "xxxy" can only be rearranged to "xxxy" or "yxxx", both of which are equal to the original string).

4. **Output 'YES'**:
   - If the string `s` contains more than two distinct characters, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because there are multiple ways to rearrange the characters to form a string that is not equal to the original string.

5. **String Rearrangement**:
   - The function then sorts the string `s` in non-decreasing order and stores it in `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in reverse (non-increasing) order and stores it in `c`.
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reverse sorted string `c`. This ensures that the output string is different from the original string.
   - If the sorted string `b` is not equal to the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string `b`. This also ensures that the output string is different from the original string.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the string has only one distinct character by implicitly falling into the 'NO' case (since a set with one character will have a length of 1, which is less than 2).

7. **Output Format**:
   - The function adheres to the output format specified in the problem statement, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the rearranged string if applicable.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output format.
