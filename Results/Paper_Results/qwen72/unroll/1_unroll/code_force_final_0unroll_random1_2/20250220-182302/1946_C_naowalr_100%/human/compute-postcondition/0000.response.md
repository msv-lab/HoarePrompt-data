To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

1. The loop will execute if the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 0.
2. Since no variables are passed to the function `func_1`, the only state we can adjust is the input provided to `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that the input provided to `sys.stdin.readline()` is a valid integer greater than 0.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
