Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the movement rules and the conditions under which the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program checks only a limited set of conditions and might incorrectly determine that the robot cannot reach the target cell in some cases where it actually can.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Movement Rules**: The robot must always move in one of the four directions (left, right, down, or up) and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The program does not correctly simulate these movements.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The program checks if `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` for odd indices `i`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. It only checks specific pairs of cells and does not consider the overall path the robot can take.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the robot might need to move back and forth between rows to reach the target cell.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), you need to simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach the target cell. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Initialize the starting position
        row = 1
        col = 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movements
        while col < n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                else:
                    col += 1
                if col < 0 or col >= n:
                    break
                row = 2 if b[col] == '<' and col > 0 else 1
            else:  # row == 2
                if b[col] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                else:
                    col += 1
                if col < 0 or col >= n:
                    break
                row = 1 if a[col] == '<' and col > 0 else 2
        
        # Check if the robot reached the target cell
        if row == 2 and col == n - 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

can_reach_target()
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
- **Simulation**: The program simulates the robot's movements by checking the current cell's arrow direction and moving accordingly. It also checks if the robot is within the grid boundaries.
- **Target Check**: After the simulation, the program checks if the robot is at the target cell (2, n).

This approach ensures that the robot's movements are correctly simulated and the target cell is reachable if and only if the robot can follow the rules and reach (2, n).
