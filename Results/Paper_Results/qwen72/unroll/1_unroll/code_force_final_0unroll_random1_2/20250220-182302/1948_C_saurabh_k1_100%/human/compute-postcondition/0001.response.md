The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be changed for the loop to execute. However, to clearly state the conditions under which the loop will execute, we can rephrase the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second and third lines of each test case are strings of length n, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. `_` is a placeholder variable.**
