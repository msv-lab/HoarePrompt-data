The function `func` accepts parameters `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function also accepts two strings of length `n`, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The function returns a result based on the input parameters and the strings provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and an even integer `n`, along with two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It returns a result based on the input parameters and the strings provided.**
