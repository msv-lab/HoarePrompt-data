### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - This part of the program is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store the cumulative time for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively.
   - It also initializes two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of the cells where the pinball changes direction.
   - This part of the program is also accurate and matches the problem description.

3. **Calculating `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - If the current cell `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the right and appends it to `A`.
   - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative time calculation is correct. For each '>', the time is calculated based on the previous cumulative time and the distance from the last '>'.
   - This part of the program is accurate.

4. **Calculating `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - If the current cell `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the left and appends it to `B`.
   - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative time calculation is correct. For each '<', the time is calculated based on the previous cumulative time and the distance from the last '<'.
   - This part of the program is accurate.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates through each cell of the grid to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on the direction of the pinball at the current cell, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios:
     - If the pinball starts moving to the right, it uses the values in `A` and `B` to compute the total time.
     - If the pinball starts moving to the left, it uses the values in `B` and `A` to compute the total time.
   - The program prints the results for each cell in the grid.
   - The logic for calculating the time is intricate but appears to be correct. The conditions handle the different scenarios where the pinball might move to the left or right and the cumulative times are used appropriately.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>', or where the pinball starts at the first or last cell.
   - For a grid entirely composed of '<', the pinball will move to the left and leave the grid in `i + 1` seconds.
   - For a grid entirely composed of '>', the pinball will move to the right and leave the grid in `n - i` seconds.
   - These edge cases are correctly handled by the program.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional lists used for precomputation.
   - The complexity analysis is correct and matches the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given problem description. The precomputation of `A` and `B` and the subsequent calculation of the time for each cell are handled in a way that should produce the correct results. The edge cases are also correctly handled, and the complexity is efficient.

Final: **True**
