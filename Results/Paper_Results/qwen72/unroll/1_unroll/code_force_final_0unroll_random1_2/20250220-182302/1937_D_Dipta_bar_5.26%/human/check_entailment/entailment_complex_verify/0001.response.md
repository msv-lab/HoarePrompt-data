### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - This part of the program is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store the cumulative time for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively.
   - It also initializes two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of the cells where the pinball changes direction.

3. **Calculating `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - If the current cell `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the right and appends it to `A`.
   - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_A`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly precomputes the cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right.

4. **Calculating `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - If the current cell `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the left and appends it to `B`.
   - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_B`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly precomputes the cumulative times for pinballs moving to the left.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates through each cell of the grid to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on the direction of the pinball at the current cell, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios:
     - If the pinball starts moving to the right, it uses the values in `A` and `B` to compute the total time.
     - If the pinball starts moving to the left, it uses the values in `B` and `A` to compute the total time.
   - The program prints the results for each cell in the grid.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>', or where the pinball starts at the first or last cell.
   - The handling of these edge cases is correct and ensures that the pinball's movement is accurately calculated.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional lists used for precomputation.
   - The complexity analysis is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Validation of the Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
  - Before the function call, `s` is a string of '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer within the specified range.
  - After the first loop, `A` and `idx_A` are correctly populated with cumulative times and indices for '>' characters.
  - After the second loop, `B` and `idx_B` are correctly populated with cumulative times and indices for '<' characters.
  - The final state of the program is correctly described, with `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` containing the necessary intermediate values.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program's logic and implementation are correct.
- The precomputation of `A` and `B` and the subsequent calculation of the time for each cell are handled appropriately.
- The edge cases are correctly managed, and the complexity analysis is accurate.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
