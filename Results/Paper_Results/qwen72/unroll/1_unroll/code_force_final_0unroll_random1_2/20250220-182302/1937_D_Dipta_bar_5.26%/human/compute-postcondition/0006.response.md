Output State: **`A` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to each position where a '>' character is found, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.** 

The code snippet initializes `idx_B` as an empty list, but does not affect the values of `A`, `idx_A`, or `B`. Therefore, the initial state of `A`, `idx_A`, and `B` remains unchanged, and `idx_B` is now an empty list.
