Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `B` is `[0, 1]`, `idx_B` is `[5, 4]`, `l` is 0, `r` is 2.**

The code snippet assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. Since `B` is `[0, 1]`, its length is 2, so `r` is now 2. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
