The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers with the constraints 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both must be odd. The function raises a `ValueError` because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`, and no values are returned.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99. It raises a `ValueError` due to an issue with unpacking `b` into `dx` and `dy`, and does not return any value.**
