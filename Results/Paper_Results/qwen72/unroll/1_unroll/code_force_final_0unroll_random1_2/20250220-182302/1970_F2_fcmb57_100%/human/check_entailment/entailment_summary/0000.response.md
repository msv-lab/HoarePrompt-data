Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N, M) and initializes the players, goals, and the Quidditch field.
   - The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions to their respective coordinate changes.
   - The `middle` variable is correctly calculated to represent the center of the field.

2. **Reading the Field**:
   - The program correctly reads the field and initializes the positions of the players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The Quidditch field is represented as a tuple with the current position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it (if any).

3. **Processing Moves**:
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move one by one.
   - For moves involving the Quaffle, it correctly updates the Quaffle's position.
   - For player moves, it correctly updates the player's position and checks for elimination if a Bludger is present.

4. **Handling Player Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies and eliminates players who come into contact with the Bludger.
   - It sorts the eliminated players alphabetically and prints the elimination events in the correct format.

5. **Handling Ball Catching and Throwing**:
   - The program correctly updates the player carrying the Quaffle when a catch action is performed.
   - However, there is a typo in the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` which should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`. This typo prevents the player from actually catching the Quaffle.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program correctly checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - The program also correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

6. **Final Score**:
   - The program prints the final score in the correct format after processing all the moves.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the position of entities (players, Quaffle) based on the movement direction.
   - The function correctly unpacks the current position `a` and the movement direction `b` and returns the new position as a tuple.
   - The execution summary mentions a `ValueError` due to unpacking a single integer, but this is incorrect. The function `func_1` is designed to handle tuples, and the input to this function is a tuple representing the current position and a tuple representing the movement direction.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor typo in the ball catching logic.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the typo in the ball catching logic (`quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`). Fixing this typo will make the program correct.
