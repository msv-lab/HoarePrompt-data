Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input, where 1 <= A, B, C <= 100. Depending on the conditions, it prints either `A * B` if `B * 2 < C`, `A * C / 2` if `A` is even, or `X * C + B` if `A` is odd (where `X = A // 2`). After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. **
