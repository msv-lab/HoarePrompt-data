### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message interval.
   - It iterates through the message times `arr` and calculates the charge consumption for each interval:
     - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send the message at `arr[0]` without turning off the phone. If `arr[0] * a` is less than `b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks if the charge consumption for the interval between the current message and the previous message is less than `b / a`. If so, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Final Charge Check:**
   - The function then calculates the total charge consumption for the intervals stored in `array2` and adds the fixed cost `b` for each message that was not included in `array2` (i.e., messages where the phone was turned off and on).
   - It compares this total charge consumption with the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total charge consumption is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the phone is turned off and on between messages correctly by checking the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function uses `b / a` to determine if the phone should be turned off and on. This is a floating-point division, which might lead to precision issues. However, since `b` and `a` are integers, the condition should be checked using integer division (`b // a`).
   - The function does not handle the case where the initial charge `f` is less than `b` (the cost of turning the phone off and on) correctly. If `f < b`, the phone cannot be turned off and on, and the function should immediately print 'No' for that test case.

6. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The function should be careful to avoid integer overflow, especially when dealing with large values of `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m_i`. However, Python's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large integers, so this is not a significant issue in this context.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the function is mostly correct but has a potential issue with the floating-point division and the initial charge check. To ensure correctness, the function should use integer division and handle the initial charge check properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        if f < b:
            print('No')
            continue
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a < b:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
                else:
                    f -= b
            else:
                if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b:
                    array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
                else:
                    f -= b
        
        if sum(array2) < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original function has issues with floating-point division and the initial charge check, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. The corrected function addresses these issues and should be more reliable.
