#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) such that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of t elements, where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains t elements, where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that, for each test case, is the next year in which all signs in the list `a` will align (i.e., the next year where the year is a multiple of all integers in `a`).
