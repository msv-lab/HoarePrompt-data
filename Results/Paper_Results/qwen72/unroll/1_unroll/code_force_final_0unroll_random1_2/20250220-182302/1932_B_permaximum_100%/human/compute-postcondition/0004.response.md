The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`. In each tuple, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns a list `results` which contains `t` elements. Each element in `results` is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all integers in the corresponding list `a` for each test case.**
