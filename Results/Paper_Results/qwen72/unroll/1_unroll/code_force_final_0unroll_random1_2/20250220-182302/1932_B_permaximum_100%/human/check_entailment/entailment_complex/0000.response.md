Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign i occurs every a_i years and must occur sequentially. The key is to find the smallest year in which each sign can occur, starting from the year immediately after the previous sign has occurred.

In the provided program, the function `func_1` processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes `current_year` to 0.
2. For each sign in the list `a`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
3. It updates `current_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
4. After processing all signs, it appends `current_year` to the `results` list.

This logic is correct because:
- It ensures that each sign occurs in a year that is a multiple of its periodicity.
- It correctly handles the sequential requirement by starting the search for the next sign from the year immediately after the previous sign has occurred.

The program also correctly handles the input and output format:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a` for each test case.
- It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
- It prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Correctness: **True**
