Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) such that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
