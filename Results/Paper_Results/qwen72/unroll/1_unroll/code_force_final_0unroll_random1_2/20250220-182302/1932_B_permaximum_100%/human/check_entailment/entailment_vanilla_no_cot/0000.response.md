Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the next year for each sign to occur. Specifically, the condition `if current_year % ai == 0` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the sequential nature of the signs. The correct approach should be to find the next multiple of `ai` that occurs after `current_year`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year + ai - 1) // ai * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

Explanation:
- For each sign `ai`, the next year in which it will occur is calculated as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year + 1`.
- The expression `(current_year + ai - 1) // ai * ai` ensures that we find the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.
