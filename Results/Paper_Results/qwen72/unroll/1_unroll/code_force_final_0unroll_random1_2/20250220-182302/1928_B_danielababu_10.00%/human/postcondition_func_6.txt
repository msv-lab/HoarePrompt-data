The function `func_7` reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, sorts the integers, and returns the sorted list as strings. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned a sorted list of strings, where each string represents an integer from the input.
