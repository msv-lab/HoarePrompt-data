The function `func_8` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. The list `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements in `arr` from the start up to the current index. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
