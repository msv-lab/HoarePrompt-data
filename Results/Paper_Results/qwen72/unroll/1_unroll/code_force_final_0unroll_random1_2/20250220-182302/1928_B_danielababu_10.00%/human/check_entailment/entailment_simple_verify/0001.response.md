### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation `p` to `a`.
   - A permutation `p` is an array of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads an integer from the input. This is typically used to read the number of test cases.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Reads a list of integers from the input and converts it to a list. This is used to read the elements of the array `a`.

3. **Analyzing the Main Program:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_3()`.
   - It calculates the maximum value in the array `a` using `max(arr)`.
   - It creates a new array `new` where each element is `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - It sorts the new array `new`.
   - It then creates a set `ans` to store unique elements from `new` that are within the range of the permutation (i.e., between 1 and `n`).
   - Finally, it prints the length of the set `ans`.

4. **Evaluating the Main Program Logic:**
   - The logic of the main program is to transform the array `a` by subtracting each element from the maximum element and adding 1. This transformation is intended to map the elements of `a` to a range that can be covered by a permutation.
   - The sorted `new` array is then used to count the unique elements that fall within the range of the permutation.
   - The length of the set `ans` is the number of unique elements in `new` that are within the range of the permutation.

5. **Correctness of the Main Program:**
   - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the new values are distinct and within the range of the permutation.
   - The set `ans` is used to count the unique elements that can be added to the array `a` to make elements equal.
   - However, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The maximum number of elements that can be made equal is not necessarily the number of unique elements in the transformed array. Instead, it should be the maximum frequency of any element in the transformed array plus the number of elements that can be added to make them equal.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 2 1 2`, the maximum value `m` is 2. The transformed array `new` is `[2, 1]`, and the set `ans` is `{1, 2}`. The program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For the input `4 7 1 4 1`, the maximum value `m` is 7. The transformed array `new` is `[1, 7, 4, 7]`, and the set `ans` is `{1, 4, 7}`. The program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2, as the maximum frequency of any element in the transformed array is 2 (for the element 7).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the maximum number of elements that can be made equal is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
