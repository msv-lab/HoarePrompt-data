### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which correctly converts the input into a list of integers.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program calculates the maximum value `m` in the array `arr`.
   - It then creates a new list `new` where each element is `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - The list `new` is sorted.
   - A set `ans` is used to store unique elements from `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The idea of calculating `m - arr[i] + 1` is to determine the potential values that can be added to `arr[i]` to make it equal to `m + 1` (the maximum possible value after adding a permutation).
  - Sorting `new` and using a set to count unique values within the range `[1, n]` is a valid approach to ensure that the permutation values are used optimally.
  - The length of the set `ans` will give the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
  - It also handles cases where all elements in `arr` are the same or where the elements are distinct.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient enough for the given constraints, as it sorts the list and uses a set to count unique elements, both operations are within the acceptable time complexity for the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly and follows the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
