### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array `a` by adding a permutation `p` of length `n` to it.
   - A permutation `p` is an array of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads an integer from the input. This is typically used to read the number of test cases.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Reads a list of integers from the input. This is typically used to read the elements of the array `a`.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Reads a list of integers from the input and converts it to a list. This is similar to `func_2` but explicitly converts the map object to a list.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** Reads a list of integers from the input, converts it to a list, and sorts it. This is not necessary for solving the problem.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** Reads a list of strings from the input. This is not relevant to the problem.
   - **Function 6 (`func_6`):** Reads a string from the input and converts it to a list of characters. This is not relevant to the problem.
   - **Function 7 (`func_7`):** Reads a list of strings from the input, converts it to a list, and sorts it. This is not relevant to the problem.
   - **Function 8 (`func_8`):** Computes the cumulative product of the elements in the array. This is not relevant to the problem.
   - **Function 9 (`func_9`):** Computes the cumulative product of the elements in the array in reverse order. This is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Identifying the Relevant Functions:**
   - The relevant functions for solving the problem are `func_1` and `func_2` (or `func_3`).

4. **Solving the Problem:**
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array.
   - The key insight is that the maximum number of elements that can be made equal is the maximum frequency of any element in the array plus the number of elements that can be added to make them equal.
   - For each element in the array, we can add a permutation value to it to make it equal to another element. The maximum number of elements that can be made equal is the maximum frequency of any element plus the number of elements that can be added to make them equal.
   - This can be achieved by adding the permutation values to the elements in such a way that the most frequent element is increased to match the next most frequent element, and so on.

5. **Evaluating the Provided Functions:**
   - The provided functions do not contain the logic to solve the problem as described. They are either reading input in different formats or performing operations that are not relevant to the problem.
   - Specifically, the functions `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, and `func_9` are not relevant to the problem and do not contribute to the solution.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` (or `func_3`) are only used for reading input, but they do not contain the logic to process the input and solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
