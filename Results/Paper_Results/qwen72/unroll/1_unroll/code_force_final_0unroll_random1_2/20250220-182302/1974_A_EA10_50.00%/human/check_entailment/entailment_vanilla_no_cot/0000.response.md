Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the variable `m` is used to calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the program incorrectly uses the variable `a` (which is the number of test cases) instead of `x` (the number of 1x1 icons) in the comparison and subsequent calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2  # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        m = 15 * z - y * 4  # Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons
        if m < x:  # Corrected: compare m with x (number of 1x1 icons)
            z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(z)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Variable `a` to `t`:** The variable `a` is renamed to `t` to correctly represent the number of test cases.
2. **Comparison with `x`:** The condition `if m < a:` is changed to `if m < x:` to correctly compare the remaining space with the number of 1x1 icons.
3. **Additional Screens Calculation:** The formula `(x - m + 14) // 15` is used to calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. This ensures that any remaining space is correctly accounted for.

With these changes, the program should correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for the given inputs.
