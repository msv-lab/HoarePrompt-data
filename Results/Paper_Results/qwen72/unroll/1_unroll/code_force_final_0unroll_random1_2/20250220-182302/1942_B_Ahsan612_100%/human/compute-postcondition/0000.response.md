The only objects in the loop head are the anonymous variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
