### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps: a chosen direction and then along the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - It first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the grid (excluding the last column) to check if there is any column `i` where the robot is blocked from moving to the next column:
     - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the robot cannot move to the next column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot is blocked in the last column:
     - If `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<', the robot cannot move to the last column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly checks for conditions that would block the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n).
   - The conditions in the loop and the final check ensure that the robot can move through the grid without being blocked.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case, storing the results and printing them in the correct format.
