You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` from standard input. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments and appends the result of each call to a list `results`. Finally, it prints each element of `results` on a new line. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot move outside the grid.
   - After each move, the robot must follow the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function takes three parameters: `n` (the number of columns), `row1` (the first row of arrows), and `row2` (the second row of arrows).
     - It checks if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
     - The function iterates over the first half of the columns (excluding the last column) and checks if there is a way to move to the second row and then to the target column.
     - If at any point, the robot is blocked from moving to the second row or from the second row to the target column, it returns 'No'.
     - If the robot can reach the target column, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the columns (from 0 to `half_n - 2`).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` points left (`'<')` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` also point left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are true, it means the robot is blocked from moving to the second row and then to the target column, so it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at the last column (`n - 1`) points left (`'<')` and if the arrow in `row2` at the second-to-last column (`n - 2`) also points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are true, it means the robot is blocked from reaching the target column, so it returns 'No'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can move to the second row and then to the target column.
   - The conditions in the loop and the final check are correct for ensuring that the robot is not blocked from reaching the target cell.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly checks the conditions for the robot to reach the target cell (2, n) and processes multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
