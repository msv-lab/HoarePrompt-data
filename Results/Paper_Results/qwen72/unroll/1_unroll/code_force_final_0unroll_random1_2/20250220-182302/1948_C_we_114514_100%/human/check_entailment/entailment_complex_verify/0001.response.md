### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot move outside the grid.
   - After each move, the robot must follow the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function takes three parameters: `n` (the number of columns), `row1` (the first row of arrows), and `row2` (the second row of arrows).
     - It checks if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
     - The function iterates over the first half of the columns (excluding the last column) and checks if there is a way to move to the second row and then to the target column.
     - If at any point, the robot is blocked from moving to the second row or from the second row to the target column, it returns 'No'.
     - If the robot can reach the target column, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the columns (from 0 to `half_n - 2`).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` points left (`'<')` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` also point left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are true, it means the robot is blocked from moving to the second row and then to the target column, so it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at the last column (`n - 1`) points left (`'<')` and if the arrow in `row2` at the second-to-last column (`n - 2`) also points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are true, it means the robot is blocked from reaching the target column, so it returns 'No'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can move to the second row and then to the target column.
   - The conditions in the loop and the final check are correct for ensuring that the robot is not blocked from reaching the target cell.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

6. **Validation with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - The state of the program before and after the loop and the final check in `func_1` is correctly described.
   - The program does not modify the input variables, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly checks the conditions for the robot to reach the target cell (2, n) and processes multiple test cases as required.

Final: **True**
