Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `lst` will contain `x-1` new key-value pairs where each key is an integer `a` and each value is a list containing the corresponding integer `b`. Similarly, `rev` will contain `x-1` new key-value pairs where each key is an integer `b` and each value is a list containing the corresponding integer `a`. The values of `n`, `u_1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer.**
