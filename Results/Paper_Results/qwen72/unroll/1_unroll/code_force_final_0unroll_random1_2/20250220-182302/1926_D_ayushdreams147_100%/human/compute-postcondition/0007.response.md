Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the occurrences of certain integers, but the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` contains the number of unique integers in the list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is 0 or the key is not present. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged. **
