You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the query point `d` is exactly at one of the known points `a_i`. Specifically, the line `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` should be adjusted to ensure that if `ql` is exactly at a known point, it is correctly identified and the corresponding time `b[s]` is returned. However, the current implementation incorrectly subtracts `a[s - 1]` and adds `b[s - 1]` even when `ql` is exactly at a known point, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
10 2 2
4 10
4 7
4
10
```
The expected output is:
```
4 7
```
However, the program will output:
```
4 6
```
This is because when `ql` is 10, the program incorrectly calculates the time by subtracting `a[s - 1]` and adding `b[s - 1]`, instead of directly returning `b[s]` when `a[s] == ql`.
