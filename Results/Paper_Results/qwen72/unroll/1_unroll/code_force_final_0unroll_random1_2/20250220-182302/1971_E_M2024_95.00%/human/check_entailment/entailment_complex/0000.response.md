### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and the times at which the car reaches those positions.

2. **Initialization of Lists:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with a leading zero to account for the starting point at 0.
   - It also initializes `ad` and `bd` with a leading zero to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program correctly calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd`.

4. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment between consecutive signs as `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

5. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, it prints `b[s]` directly.
   - If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting `a[s-1]` from `ql` to get the remaining distance to travel in the current segment.
     - Adding the time taken to reach the previous sign `b[s-1]` to the time taken to travel the remaining distance in the current segment, which is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - The result is printed as an integer, which is the time rounded down to the nearest integer.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query in the correct format, with each result separated by a space and a newline after each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed calculation `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` is not necessary for the solution. The program can directly use `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to calculate the time for the remaining distance without storing the speeds in a list.
- **Redundant Variables:** The list `v` is not used in the final calculations and can be removed to simplify the code.

### Correctness:
Despite the minor issues mentioned, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the calculations for the queries are accurate.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
