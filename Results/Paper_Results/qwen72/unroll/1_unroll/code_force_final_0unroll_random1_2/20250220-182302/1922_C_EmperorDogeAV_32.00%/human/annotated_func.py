#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers in ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):

    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element is either 1 or the distance to the next city in the `cities` list, depending on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the distance to the next city in the `cities` list, depending on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in ascending order and an integer `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the next city in the `cities` list if that distance is less than or equal to the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it is 1.
