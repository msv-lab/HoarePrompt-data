### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is indeed flawed. It is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it is storing the distance to the closest city instead of the index of the closest city. This is a significant issue because the problem requires us to travel to the closest city, not just know the distance.
   - The logic for determining the closest city is also incorrect. The function should check the distance to the next city and the previous city, but it is not correctly handling the edge cases where `i` is 0 or `n-1`. For example, when `i` is 0, `back` should be `cities[0]` (the current city itself), and when `i` is `n-1`, `forward` should be `cities[n-1]` (the current city itself).

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are being populated with the distances to the closest cities, but they should be populated with the minimum number of coins required to travel to the closest city.
   - The prefix sum calculation is not correctly handling the logic of traveling to the closest city for each city. The prefix sum should accumulate the minimum number of coins required to travel from the start city to each city, considering the closest city as a 1-coin travel.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program is not correctly handling the queries. It is using the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum number of coins, but the prefix sum arrays are not correctly representing the minimum cost to travel between cities.
   - The program should precompute the minimum cost to travel from any city to any other city and use this precomputed data to handle queries efficiently.

### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because:
- `func_1` will return a list of distances to the closest city, not the indices of the closest cities.
- The prefix sum arrays will be populated with these distances, which are not the correct minimum costs.
- The queries will use these incorrect prefix sums to compute the minimum number of coins, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city by storing the index of the closest city.
2. Use dynamic programming to precompute the minimum number of coins required to travel from any city to any other city.
3. Handle the queries efficiently using the precomputed minimum costs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues identified.

Final: **False**
