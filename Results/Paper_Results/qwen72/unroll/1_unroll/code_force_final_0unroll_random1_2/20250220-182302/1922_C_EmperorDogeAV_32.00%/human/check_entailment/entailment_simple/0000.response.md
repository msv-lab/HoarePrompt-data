### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the queries and processes them.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes a list `prog_cities` of size `n-1` with zeros.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - It then decides whether to travel to the next city or the previous city based on the minimum distance and updates `prog_cities` accordingly.
   - However, there is a logical error in the function:
     - The condition `if i < n - 1:` is always true because `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`.
     - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is incorrect. It should be checking the distance to the closest city, not just the next or previous city. The correct condition should be:
       ```python
       if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):
           prog_cities[i] = 1
       else:
           prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
       ```

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - The prefix sums are used to quickly compute the total cost of traveling from one city to another.
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly, but the function `func_1` returns incorrect values, which will affect the prefix sums.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each query by checking if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - The logic for query processing is correct, but it relies on the incorrect values from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` contains a logical error in determining the closest city, which affects the prefix sums and, consequently, the query results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
