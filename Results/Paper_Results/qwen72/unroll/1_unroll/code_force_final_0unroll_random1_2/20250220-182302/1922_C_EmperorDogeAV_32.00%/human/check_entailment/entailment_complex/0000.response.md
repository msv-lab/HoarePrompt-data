### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The coordinates are stored in a list `cities` and converted to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - It then determines the closest city by comparing these distances. If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the distance to the next city.
   - This function is called twice: once for the original list of cities and once for the reversed list of cities. This is necessary because the closest city can be in either direction.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are initialized with a single zero.
   - For each city, the prefix sum is updated by adding the corresponding value from `forward_cities` or `backward_cities`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sums.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the distance calculation. Specifically, the line `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` should be `if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):`.
   - The current implementation incorrectly sets `forward` to `99999999` and `back` to `-99999999` for the first and last cities, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation in the main program is incorrect. It should be `pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[-1] + forward_cities[i])` and `pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[-1] + backward_cities[i])` to correctly accumulate the distances.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The query handling logic is incorrect. The program should not directly subtract the prefix sums to get the minimum cost. Instead, it should consider the cost of traveling to the closest city and then to the destination city.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate closest city distances in forward direction
    forward_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i < n - 1:
            forward_cities[i] = 1 if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) else abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
    
    # Calculate closest city distances in backward direction
    backward_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if i > 0:
            backward_cities[i - 1] = 1 if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i + 1]) else abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
    
    # Calculate prefix sums for forward and backward distances
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[-1] + forward_cities[i])
    
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[-1] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[a - 1] - pref_sum_b[b - 1])
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified and the corrected program, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
