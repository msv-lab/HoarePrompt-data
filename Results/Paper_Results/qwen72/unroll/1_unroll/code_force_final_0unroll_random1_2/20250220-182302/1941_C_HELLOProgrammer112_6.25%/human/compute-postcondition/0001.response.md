Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each test case, it will read an integer a (which is not used in the loop body), a string s, count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in s, and print the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the initial variables t and s_list will remain unchanged, and the loop will have printed the sum of counts for each test case.**
