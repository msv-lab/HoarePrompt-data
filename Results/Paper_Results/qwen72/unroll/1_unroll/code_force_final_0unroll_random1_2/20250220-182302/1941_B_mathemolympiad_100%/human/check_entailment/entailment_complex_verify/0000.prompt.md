You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum

            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case based on the conditions inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the list `a` can be modified through a series of operations such that the last two elements of the list become zero. If at any point an element in the list is negative, or if the last two elements are not zero after the operations, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `a` outside the scope of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that it does not check if the elements of the array can be reduced to zero in a way that maintains non-negative values throughout the process. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Reason:**
The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this input. However, it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations:

1. Apply the operation at \( i = 2 \):
   - \( a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - \( a_2 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] \)

2. Apply the operation at \( i = 3 \):
   - \( a_2 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (This step is invalid because \( a_2 \) becomes negative, but the program does not handle this correctly)
   - \( a_3 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_4 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, -1, 0, 1, 1] \)

3. Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \):
   - \( a_3 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (This step is invalid because \( a_3 \) becomes negative)
   - \( a_4 = 1 - 2 = -1 \)
   - \( a_5 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, -1, -1, -1, 0] \)

The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements can be reduced to zero without any intermediate negative values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
