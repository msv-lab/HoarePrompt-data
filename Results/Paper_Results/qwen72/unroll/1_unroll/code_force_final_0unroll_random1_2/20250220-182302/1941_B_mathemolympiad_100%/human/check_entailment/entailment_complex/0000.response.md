### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying the operation: `a[i-1] -= 1`, `a[i] -= 2`, `a[i+1] -= 1` for any index `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`.
   - The operation can be applied any number of times, and any index can be used multiple times.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element (excluding the last two elements).
   - During each iteration, it checks if the current element `a[i]` is negative. If it is, it prints "NO" and stops further processing for that test case.
   - If `a[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation by subtracting `a[i]` from `a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i]` from `a[i]`, and `a[i]` from `a[i+1]`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Considerations:**
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The loop ensures that the operation is applied to all possible indices `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`.
   - The condition `if a[i] < 0` correctly checks if the operation would make any element negative, which is not allowed.
   - The final check `if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary for the entire array to be zero.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array is already zero.
   - It also handles cases where the array cannot be made zero, such as when the sum of the elements is odd (since each operation reduces the sum by 4, an odd sum cannot be reduced to zero).

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function does not explicitly check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made zero. However, the operations and checks in the loop implicitly handle this condition.
   - The function correctly updates the array elements and checks for negative values, ensuring that the operation is valid.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made zero using the specified operations. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases as described in the problem.
