Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Frequency Count**: For each test case, it initializes a list `freq` of length 7 (to represent the frequencies of problems with difficulties 'A' to 'G') with all elements set to 0.

3. **Counting Frequencies**: It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the character's position in the alphabet (e.g., 'A' corresponds to index 0, 'B' to index 1, and so on).

4. **Calculating Missing Problems**: It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by taking the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, the result is 0. The sum of these values gives the total number of problems needed to be added.

5. **Appending Results**: The total number of missing problems is appended to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results**: Finally, the function returns the `results` list.

The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem. It correctly counts the frequencies of each difficulty level and calculates the minimum number of problems needed to ensure each difficulty level appears at least `m` times in the given string `a`.

Given the execution summary, the function behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
