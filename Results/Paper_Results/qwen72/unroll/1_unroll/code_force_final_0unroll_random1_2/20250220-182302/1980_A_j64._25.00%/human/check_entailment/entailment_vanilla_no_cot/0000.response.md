Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold the specified number of rounds by:

1. Parsing the test cases.
2. Counting the frequency of each difficulty level in the given problem bank.
3. Calculating the number of missing problems for each difficulty level required to hold the specified number of rounds.
4. Summing up the total number of missing problems for each test case and appending the result to the `results` list.
5. Printing the results for each test case.

The program's logic is sound and matches the requirements of the problem statement. The example input and output provided also match the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.
