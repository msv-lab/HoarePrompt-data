#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: The `results` list is populated with `t` integers, each representing the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`. The `freq` list is reset to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` for each iteration, and `missing` is calculated based on the frequency of characters in the string `a` for each test case. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which contains `t` integers. Each integer in the `results` list represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`. The `freq` list and `missing` are recalculated for each test case, but they are not part of the returned output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the corresponding string `a` to ensure each character appears at least `m` times. The original `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
