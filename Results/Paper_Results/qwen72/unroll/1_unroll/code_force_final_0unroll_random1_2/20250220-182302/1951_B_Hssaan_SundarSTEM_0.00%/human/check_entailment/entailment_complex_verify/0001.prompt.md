You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is the number of cows, `k` is the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `ratings` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ratings[i] ≤ 10^9.

    #State: The loop will execute multiple times, each time processing a new set of inputs. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by your cow in each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` will be reset and redefined for each iteration, so their final values will be the ones corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each with a different set of inputs. For each test case, it takes the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of distinct ratings `ratings`. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be considered as having a higher rating than your cow, based on the given ratings and the position of your cow. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the result for each one, and the final state of the program will be the completion of the last test case, with all local variables reset and redefined for each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination style where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.
   - We want to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow once.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of our cow).
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `s`.

3. **First Swap and Simulation:**
   - The program swaps the position of cow `k` with the first cow (position 1).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of wins.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the first cow (which is now our cow `k`).
   - It iterates through the list starting from the second cow and increments `ans` for each match our cow wins.
   - The loop breaks when our cow loses a match.
   - It records the index `p` where our cow lost.

4. **Second Swap and Simulation:**
   - The program swaps the position of cow `k` back to its original position.
   - It then swaps the position of cow `k` with the position `p` (where it lost in the first simulation).
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will count the number of wins in this new simulation.
   - It iterates through the list again, checking if the current cow is our cow `k` and if it has already been counted in the wins.
   - It increments `ans1` for each match our cow wins.
   - The loop breaks when our cow loses a match.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins between the two simulations.

### Analysis:
- **First Simulation:**
  - This simulation checks the number of wins if our cow `k` is placed at the beginning.
  - It correctly counts the wins and stops when our cow loses.

- **Second Simulation:**
  - This simulation checks the number of wins if our cow `k` is placed at the position where it lost in the first simulation.
  - It correctly counts the wins and stops when our cow loses.

- **Optimal Swap:**
  - The program considers two possible scenarios: placing our cow at the beginning and placing it at the position where it lost in the first simulation.
  - It then prints the maximum number of wins from these two scenarios.

### Issues:
- **Index Handling:**
  - The variable `j` is used to track the index where our cow loses in the first simulation, but it is not necessary since `p` already stores this information.
  - The second loop should start from the second cow (`s[1:]`) to avoid counting the initial position of our cow.

- **Redundant Swaps:**
  - The program swaps the cow back to its original position after the first simulation, which is unnecessary since the list can be reset by re-reading the input for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has some redundant steps and minor issues. However, these issues do not affect the correctness of the final output. The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly solves the problem by considering the two possible scenarios and printing the maximum number of wins.
