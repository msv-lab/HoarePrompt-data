The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `ratings`. `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n. `ratings` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are within the range 1 ≤ ratings[i] ≤ 10^9. The function returns the maximum number of cows that can be considered as having a higher rating than your cow, based on the given ratings list and the index `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of cows), `k` (the index of your cow), and `ratings` (a list of distinct integers representing the ratings of the cows). It returns the maximum number of cows that can be considered as having a higher rating than your cow.**
