The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1. 

The state before the loop starts does not directly influence the loop head, but it provides context for the function `max_wins(n, k, ratings)`. However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that the input to `range` is a positive integer.

State: **`_` is a dummy variable, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
