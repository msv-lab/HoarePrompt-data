Output State: **The loop will execute multiple times, each time processing a new set of inputs. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by your cow in each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` will be reset and redefined for each iteration, so their final values will be the ones corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.**
