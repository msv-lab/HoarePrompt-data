The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 5000, `n`, an integer between 1 and 50, and `a`, a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not specified.**
