Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of 2n integers. Sorting is crucial because it allows us to pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller number of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the smaller number of each pair is always the first number in the pair.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
- **Sorting**: By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together. This is because the minimum value in each pair will be the smaller of the two numbers, and we want to maximize the sum of these minimum values.
- **Pairing**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` ensures that we are always selecting the smaller number of each pair (i.e., `l[i]` for each pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`).

### Example Walkthrough:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 3`
  - Sorted: `2 3`
  - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
  - Score: `2` (since `min(2, 3) = 2`)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2` (since `min(1, 1) = 1` and `min(1, 2) = 1`)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (since `min(1, 1) = 1` for each pair)

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
