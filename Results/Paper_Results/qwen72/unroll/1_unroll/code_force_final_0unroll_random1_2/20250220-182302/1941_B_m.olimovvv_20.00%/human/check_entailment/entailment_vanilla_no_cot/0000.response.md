Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. The program checks only the first and last elements of the array to determine if it is possible to make all elements zero. This is insufficient because the operation can affect any element in the array from index 2 to n-1, and the conditions for the first and last elements alone do not guarantee that the entire array can be reduced to zero.

2. The conditions used in the program are not correct for determining if the array can be reduced to zero. Specifically, the conditions `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` do not accurately reflect the constraints needed to solve the problem.

3. The correct approach to solve this problem involves checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 and if the array can be reduced to zero by performing the operations. The operations reduce the sum of the array by 4 each time, so the sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce all elements to zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
        if sum(a) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be reduced to zero
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i] < 2:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If it is not, it immediately prints "NO". If the sum is divisible by 4, it then checks if there is any element in the array (from index 1 to n-2) that is less than 2, which would make it impossible to perform the required operation. If no such element exists, it prints "YES".
