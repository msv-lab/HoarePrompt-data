The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the input.**
