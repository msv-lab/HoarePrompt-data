The only variables in the loop head are the anonymous variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which will be used to determine the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
