### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can perform two types of moves: adding 1 cube or removing 1 cube.
   - After `n` moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
   - The key insight is that the number of cubes `m` must be within the range of possible outcomes after `n` moves. Since each move can either add or remove a cube, the number of cubes `m` must be such that `0 <= m <= n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - `if n == m: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `n` equals `m`, Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `n` moves.
   - `elif m > n: print('No')`
     - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `m` is `n - 1`, Nikita can add `m` cubes and then remove one cube in the last move.
   - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs, and then making one additional move to adjust the parity.
   - `else: print('No')`
     - This is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it's impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or `n` is 0 correctly.
   - The conditions cover all possible parities of `m` and `n`.

5. **Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:**
     - The function `func` is called without parameters, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - **Reading Test Cases:**
     - `t = int(input())` correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - **Processing Each Test Case:**
     - `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` correctly reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - **Conditions:**
     - The conditions are evaluated in the correct order:
       - `if n == m: print('Yes')` checks if `n` equals `m`.
       - `elif m > n: print('No')` checks if `m` is greater than `n`.
       - `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')` checks if `m` is `n - 1`.
       - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0: print('Yes')` checks if both `m` and `n` are even.
       - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0: print('Yes')` checks if both `m` and `n` are odd.
       - `else: print('No')` covers all other cases.
   - **Final State:**
     - The values of `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop.
     - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
     - The loop will print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions provided for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and conditions described in the problem. The conditions are logically sound and cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
