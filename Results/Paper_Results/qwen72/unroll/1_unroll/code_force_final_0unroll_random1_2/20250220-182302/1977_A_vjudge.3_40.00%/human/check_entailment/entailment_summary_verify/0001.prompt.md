You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input. It then checks several conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on these conditions for each test case. The conditions are: if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is greater than `n`, if `m` equals `n - 1`, if both `m` and `n` are even, or if both `m` and `n` are odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `n` and `m` input by the user, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can perform two types of moves: adding 1 cube or removing 1 cube.
   - After `n` moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
   - The key insight is that the number of cubes `m` must be within the range of possible outcomes after `n` moves. Since each move can either add or remove a cube, the number of cubes `m` must be such that `0 <= m <= n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - `if n == m: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `n` equals `m`, Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `n` moves.
   - `elif m > n: print('No')`
     - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `m` is `n - 1`, Nikita can add `m` cubes and then remove one cube in the last move.
   - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs, and then making one additional move to adjust the parity.
   - `else: print('No')`
     - This is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it's impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or `n` is 0 correctly.
   - The conditions cover all possible parities of `m` and `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and conditions described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
