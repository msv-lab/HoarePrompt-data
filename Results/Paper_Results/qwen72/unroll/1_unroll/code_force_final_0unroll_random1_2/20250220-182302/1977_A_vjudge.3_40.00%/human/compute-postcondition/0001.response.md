The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state provided does not specify the value of `t`, but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
