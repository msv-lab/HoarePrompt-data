### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1` Overview:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell, based on the rules provided.

3. **List `A` and `idx_A` Calculation:**
   - `A` is a list that keeps track of the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '>' characters seen so far.
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' characters are found in the string `s`.
   - This part of the function correctly identifies and processes the '>' characters.

4. **List `B` and `idx_B` Calculation:**
   - `B` is a list that keeps track of the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '<' characters seen so far, but in reverse order.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`, in reverse order.
   - This part of the function correctly identifies and processes the '<' characters.

5. **Main Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each cell in the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic is complex but follows the rules:
     - If the current cell contains '>', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts and positions of '>' and '<' characters.
     - If the current cell contains '<', it calculates the time similarly but in reverse.
   - The conditions and calculations are designed to handle the movement and inversion of characters as described in the problem.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell in the string `s`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is consistent with the problem description.
- The use of cumulative counts and positions in lists `A` and `B` ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
