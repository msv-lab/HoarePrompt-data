Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list where each element represents the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '<' characters seen so far, in reverse order, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`, in reverse order, `l` is 0.** 

The variable `l` is initialized to 0, while all other variables (`A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
