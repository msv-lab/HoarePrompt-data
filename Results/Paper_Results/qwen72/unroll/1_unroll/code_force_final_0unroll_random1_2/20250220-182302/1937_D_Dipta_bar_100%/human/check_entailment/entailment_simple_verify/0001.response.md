### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store the cumulative movements of the pinball when it encounters a '>' or '<' respectively.

3. **Building List `A`**:
   - `A` is built by iterating from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous '>' positions and appends it to `A`.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of '>' characters.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of `A` and `idx_A` after this loop is correct. `A` contains the cumulative movement times for '>' characters, and `idx_A` contains their indices.

4. **Building List `B`**:
   - `B` is built by iterating from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous '<' positions and appends it to `B`.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of '<' characters.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of `B` and `idx_B` after this loop is correct. `B` contains the cumulative movement times for '<' characters in reverse order, and `idx_B` contains their indices in reverse order.

5. **Calculating Output for Each Cell**:
   - The program then iterates through each cell `i` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movement times based on the current position and the positions of the last encountered '>' or '<'.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of `l` and `r` is correctly managed. `l` is the number of '>' characters encountered so far, and `r` is the number of '<' characters remaining to be processed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the grid.
   - It also correctly handles the transition between different segments of the grid.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The program correctly handles the edge cases where `l` or `r` are zero, ensuring that the pinball's movement is calculated accurately.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The final state of the program ensures that all results are printed in the correct format for each test case.

### Original Assessment Review:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the function call and the output formatting.
- The corrected program addresses these issues by storing the results in a list and printing them in the required format for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and providing a corrected version of the program. The corrected program should now correctly handle the input and output for each test case, ensuring the results are printed in the required format.

Final: **True**
