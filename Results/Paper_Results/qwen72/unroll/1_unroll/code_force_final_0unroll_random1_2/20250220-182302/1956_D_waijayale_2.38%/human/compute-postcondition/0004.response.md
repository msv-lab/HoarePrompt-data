To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `l`, `r`, and the list `ops`. The loop will execute if `ops` contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

For the loop to execute, `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples. The variables `l` and `r` are not explicitly initialized before the loop, but they will be assigned values from the tuples in `ops` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `ops` is non-empty and `l` and `r` are ready for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples, `l` and `r` are the first elements of the first tuple in `ops`**
