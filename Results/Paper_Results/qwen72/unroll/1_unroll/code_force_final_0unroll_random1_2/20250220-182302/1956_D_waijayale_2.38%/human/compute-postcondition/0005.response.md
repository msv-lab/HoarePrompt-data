To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We have an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, a list `a` of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each pair `(l, r)` in the list `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

3. **Effect of the Loop**: The loop only prints values and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `s`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged after the loop execution.

4. **Output State**: Since the loop does not alter any of the variables, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.**
