### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations are limited to no more than 5 * 10^5.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a subarray `a[l:r]` is the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where `l == r` and also to recursively set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX. Instead, it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX. This can lead to incorrect results.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Issue**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`. It should be `func_1` or `recursive_maximize_sum` should be defined properly.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If false, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively calls itself for the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX. It sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX. This can lead to incorrect results.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.
     - **Issue**: The function `func_2` does not correctly compute the MEX and may return incorrect results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. For example, in the case where `a = [0, 1]`, the MEX should be 2, but the program sets the subarray to 1, which is incorrect.
   - The recursive function `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not compute the MEX correctly, leading to incorrect modifications of the array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle arrays of length 1 correctly, but it does not because it sets the element to 0, which is not the MEX if the element is already 0.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is 0 correctly, but it does not because it sets the subarray to 1, which is incorrect.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is greater than 0 correctly, but it does not because it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program uses recursion and splits the array based on the maximum value, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5. However, the operations themselves are incorrect due to the MEX calculation issue.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the MEX correctly, leading to incorrect modifications of the array and incorrect results.

Final: **False**
