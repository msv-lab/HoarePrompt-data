Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`. The correct call should be `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1, ops)`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. The function `func_1` sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` without ensuring that this is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the subarray is `[0, 1, 2]`, the MEX should be `3`, but the program sets it to `3` without checking if `3` is actually the MEX.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly notes that the program does not handle the case where the array is already optimal. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program should return the sum as `6` and `0` operations, but it might incorrectly attempt to perform operations. This is a significant issue because the program should recognize when no further operations are needed.

4. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. The function does not correctly split the array and handle the MEX calculation for each segment. The logic for splitting the array around the maximum element is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated for each subarray.

5. **Specific Example**:
   - The provided example input `[1, 2, 3, 4]` correctly demonstrates that the program will likely attempt to perform operations, which is incorrect because the sum of the array is already maximized. The expected output should be `10 0`, but the program will likely produce a different result.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.

Final: **False**
