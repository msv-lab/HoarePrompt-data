You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, where 1 \leq |s| \leq 500. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop prints the number of positions in each string `s` where a character is greater than the character immediately following it, plus one, for each of the `t` test cases. The variable `s` will contain the last input string provided. The variable `count` will be the count of such positions for the last input string, plus one.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a binary string `s`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character is greater than the next character. Since the characters are '0' and '1', this check is equivalent to checking if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the `count` by 1. This indicates a point where a cut is necessary to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the points where a '1' is followed by a '0'. Each such point requires a cut to ensure that the '1' and '0' can be separated and rearranged.
   - The total number of cuts needed is `count`, and the number of pieces is `count + 1` because each cut creates one additional piece.
   - The program handles the edge cases where the string is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" and "1") correctly by printing 1, as no cuts are needed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string with only '0's or only '1's, the program correctly outputs 1.
   - For a string that is already sorted (e.g., "0001111"), the program correctly outputs 1.
   - For a string that requires multiple cuts (e.g., "11010"), the program correctly outputs 3.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in O(n) time for each test case, where n is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the given test cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
