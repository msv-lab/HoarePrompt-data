Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The program iterates through the string and increments the count whenever it encounters a transition from '1' to '0'. This count, plus one, gives the minimum number of pieces required, as each transition indicates a point where a new piece must start to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's in the final rearranged string. The program handles all edge cases, including strings that are already sorted, strings with only one character, and strings with multiple transitions. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
