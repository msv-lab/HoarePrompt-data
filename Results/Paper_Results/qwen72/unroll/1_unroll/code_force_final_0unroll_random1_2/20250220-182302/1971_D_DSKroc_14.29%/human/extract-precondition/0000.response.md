Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, where 1 \leq |s| \leq 500. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 500.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:
```
def func(s):
```

This ensures that the function can accept the binary string `s` as an input parameter.
