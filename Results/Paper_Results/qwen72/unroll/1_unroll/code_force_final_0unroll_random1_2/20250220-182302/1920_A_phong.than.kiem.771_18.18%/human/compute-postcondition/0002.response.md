To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `index != -1`. This condition depends on the value of `index`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `string` and `substring` are strings, where `substring` is a non-empty string that may or may not be present in `string`.
- `indices` is an empty list.
- `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if `substring` is found, otherwise `index` is -1.

For the loop to execute, `index` must be a value other than -1. This means that `substring` must be found in `string`, and `index` must be set to the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `index` is not -1. This can be achieved by ensuring that `substring` is present in `string`.

State: **`string` and `substring` are strings, where `substring` is a non-empty string and is present in `string`. `indices` is an empty list. `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.**
