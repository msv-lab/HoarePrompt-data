Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The output should be the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each test case.

3. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program uses a predefined string `alphabet` which contains all lowercase Latin letters.
   - It processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.
   - Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs the word:
     - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - If `n > 26`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

4. **Verification of the Approach**:
   - **Case 1: n > 52**:
     - The maximum sum of two letters is 26 + 26 = 52.
     - If `n > 52`, the third letter must be 'z' (26) and the second letter must also be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is then `alphabet[n - 53]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is the smallest possible, and the other two are 'z'.
     - Example: For `n = 78`, the word is `alphabet[78 - 53] + 'zz' = 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz'`.

   - **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**:
     - The maximum sum of one letter is 26.
     - If `n > 26`, the third letter must be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is 'a' (1), and the second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is 'a', and the second letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.
     - Example: For `n = 50`, the word is `'a' + alphabet[50 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + 'v' + 'z' = 'avz'`.

   - **Case 3: n ≤ 26**:
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word can be constructed with the first two letters as 'a' (1 + 1 = 2).
     - The third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.
     - Example: For `n = 10`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[10 - 3] = 'aa' + 'h' = 'aah'`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` based on the logic described.
   - The logic covers all possible ranges of `n` and ensures the smallest possible letters are used.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for the case where `26 < n ≤ 52`:
   - The program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This approach assumes that the second letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n - 27`, but it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `n = 51`, the program constructs `'a' + alphabet[51 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + 'w' + 'z' = 'awz'`.
   - However, the lexicographically smallest word for `n = 51` should be `'azz'` (1 + 26 + 24 = 51).

Therefore, the program is incorrect for some values of `n` in the range `26 < n ≤ 52`.

Final: **False**
