The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration. The other variables (`alphabet`, `t`, and `n`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
