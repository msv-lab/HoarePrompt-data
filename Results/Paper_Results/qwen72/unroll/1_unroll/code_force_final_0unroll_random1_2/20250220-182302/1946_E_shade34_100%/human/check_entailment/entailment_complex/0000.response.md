### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Calculation:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is done to efficiently compute combinations and permutations later in the program. The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Validity Check:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is 1, and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses a combination of factorials to calculate the number of valid permutations. The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of a factorial, which is necessary for calculating combinations in modular arithmetic.

5. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - For each suffix maximum index `x` in `s`, the program calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the permutation. This is done using the combination formula and updating the `ans` variable.

6. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program processes the prefix maximums in reverse order (excluding the last two). For each prefix maximum index `x` in `p2`, it calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the permutation, similar to the suffix maximums.

7. **Final Permutation Count:**
   - The program multiplies the `ans` variable by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums. This accounts for the different ways to arrange the elements in these gaps.

8. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis:

- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is designed to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` is the modular inverse and `d` is a byproduct of the computation.
  - The function handles edge cases where `b` is 0, `a` is less than `b`, `a` is divisible by `b`, and the general case where `a` is not divisible by `b`.

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a` to get the result. This is used to compute combinations in modular arithmetic.

### Overall Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and input format.
- The combination and permutation calculations are performed using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.
- The initial validity check ensures that the input is consistent with the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The combination and permutation calculations are done in a way that accounts for all possible valid permutations.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
