Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular arithmetic, which are not directly relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Analysis of the Functions

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of Bézout's identity. However, the problem does not require finding GCDs or coefficients of Bézout's identity.
   - The function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, which is part of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not help in solving the permutation problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to perform a modular multiplication. Specifically, it computes `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is obtained from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
   - The function `func_2` is typically used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `1000000007` and then multiply it by `a`. This is useful in modular arithmetic but not in counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Problem Requirements

The problem requires:
- Counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific indices as prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
- The indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are given in increasing order.
- The result should be output modulo `1000000007`.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of the maximum elements in the permutation.
2. Ensure that the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are consistent with the permutation.
3. Count the number of valid permutations that satisfy these conditions.

The provided functions do not perform these steps. They are focused on modular arithmetic, which is not the core of the problem.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Final: **False**
