The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts `t`, an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which likely represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
