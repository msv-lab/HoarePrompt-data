The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, so it needs to be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
