Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The key to solving this problem is to understand that the operation can only be applied to indices where the elements are greater than or equal to the required decrements.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero.
   - This function is correct as it iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - The loop iterates from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive), and for each index `i`, it checks if the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are greater than the required decrements (1, 2, 1 respectively).
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the current implementation of the operation is incorrect. The lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation incorrectly uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which can lead to invalid operations and incorrect results.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The main loop reads the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - `func_2` should correctly apply the operations and then call `func_1` to check if the array can be made all zeros.
   - Due to the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program will not work as intended and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not applied correctly. The elements should be decremented by fixed values (1, 2, 1) rather than using `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value. This mistake will lead to incorrect modifications of the array and, consequently, incorrect outputs.
