The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).

If the conditions for `list` and `n` are met, the function returns a value based on these inputs. However, the specific output based on these inputs is not provided in the example. Assuming the function is designed to return a subset of the list or some value derived from the list and `n`, we can describe the functionality in a general way.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It returns a value based on the list and the integer `n`.**
