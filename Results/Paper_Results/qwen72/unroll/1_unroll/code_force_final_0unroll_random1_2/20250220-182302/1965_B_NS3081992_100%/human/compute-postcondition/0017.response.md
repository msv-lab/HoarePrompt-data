Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the string `bk`, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1` is appended to `ans`.**
