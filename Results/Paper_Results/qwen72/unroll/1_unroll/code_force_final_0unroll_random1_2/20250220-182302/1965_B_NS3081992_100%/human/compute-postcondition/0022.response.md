Output State: **The program returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The length of `ans` and the elements in `ans` depend on the value of `k` and the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements. Otherwise, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
