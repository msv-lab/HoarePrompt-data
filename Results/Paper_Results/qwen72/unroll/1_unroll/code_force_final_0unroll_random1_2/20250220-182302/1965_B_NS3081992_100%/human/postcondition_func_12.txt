The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second values from the recursive call, respectively), and the third value from the recursive call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned the tuple `(x, y, g)`, which represents the coefficients and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` in the context of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
