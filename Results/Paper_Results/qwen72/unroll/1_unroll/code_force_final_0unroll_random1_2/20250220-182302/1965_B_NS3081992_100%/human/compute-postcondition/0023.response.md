The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, the output of the function depends on the values of `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

**Case_1:** The function returns the string '1\n2'.

**Case_2:** The function returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The list `ans` is constructed based on the value of `k` and the binary representation of `n` and `k`:
- If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements.
- Otherwise, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

Functionality: **The function returns a string. If `k == 1`, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The list `ans` is constructed based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512. If `k` is not 1, `ans` contains specific powers of 2 and additional values derived from `k`.**
