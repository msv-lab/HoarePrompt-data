The function `func` accepts several parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.

The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, but based on the parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on some computation involving `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2·10^5, `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2·min(n, m), `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
