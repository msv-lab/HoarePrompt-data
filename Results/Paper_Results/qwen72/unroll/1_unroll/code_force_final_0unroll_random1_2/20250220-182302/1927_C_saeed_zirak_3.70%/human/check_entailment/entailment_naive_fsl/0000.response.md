Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where an integer from 1 to k is present in one of the arrays but not in the other, and the count of such integers exceeds the allowed limit of `k // 2` for that array. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4
```

In this case, the program will output "no" because it will try to distribute the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 between the two arrays. However, the correct output should be "yes" because we can choose 1 and 3 from the first array and 2 and 4 from the second array, which satisfies the condition. The program fails to correctly account for the distribution of numbers when they are not equally present in both arrays.
