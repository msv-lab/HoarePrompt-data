You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array `x`. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the array `a` will contain `n` elements where `a[0]` is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` will remain unchanged as they are input variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `x`. It then constructs an array `a` of `n` elements where `a[0]` is set to 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]`. The function prints the elements of `a` for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).

2. **Construction of the array `a`:**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) for \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - This construction ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because:
     - By definition, \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i\).
     - Therefore, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and \(1 \le x_i \le 500\) are respected.
   - Since \(a_0 = 1000\) and each subsequent \(a_i\) is constructed by adding a value \(x_i\) which is at most 500, the values of \(a_i\) will not exceed \(10^9\) even for the maximum \(n = 500\).

4. **Test Case Verification:**
   - Let's verify the first test case:
     - Input: \(n = 4\), \(x = [2, 4, 1]\)
     - Output: \(a = [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007]\)
     - Check:
       - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 = x_2\)
       - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 = x_3\)
       - \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 = x_4\)
   - The output satisfies the conditions for the given test case.

5. **Generalization:**
   - The program generalizes this construction for any valid input \(x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\).
   - The construction \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) ensures that the modulo condition is always satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and satisfies the problem statement for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
