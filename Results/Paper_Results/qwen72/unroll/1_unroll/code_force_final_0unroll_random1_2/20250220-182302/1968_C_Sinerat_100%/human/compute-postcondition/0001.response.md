Output State: **For each test case, the array `a` will contain `n` elements where `a[0]` is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 â‰¤ i < n) is the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` will remain unchanged as they are input variables.**
