Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values of `x` are such that the constructed array `a` does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1002 1006 1007
```
However, this output is incorrect because:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 \) (which is correct for \( x_2 \))
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \) (which is correct for \( x_3 \))
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 \) (which is correct for \( x_4 \))

But if we consider a different input:
```
1
3
1 5
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1001 1006
```
However, this output is incorrect because:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \) (which is correct for \( x_2 \))
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1001 = 5 \) (which is correct for \( x_3 \))

The issue is that the program always starts with `a[0] = 1000`, which is a fixed value. This approach may not always work for all possible inputs, especially when the values of `x` are large or have specific patterns that require a different initial value for `a[0]`.

To ensure correctness, the initial value of `a[0]` should be chosen more carefully, such that it can handle all potential cases. For example, a correct approach would be to set `a[0]` to a value that is greater than the maximum value in `x` and then construct the array `a` accordingly.
