You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array `x`. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the array `a` will contain `n` elements where `a[0]` is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` will remain unchanged as they are input variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each case. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
