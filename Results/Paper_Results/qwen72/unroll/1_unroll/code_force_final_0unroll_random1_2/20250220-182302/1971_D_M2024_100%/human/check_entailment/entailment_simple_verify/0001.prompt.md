You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `a` from the input. It will then count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (stored in `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (stored in `cut0`) in the string `a`. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it will print `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it will print `cut0 + cut1`. The values of `cut0` and `cut1` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The initial binary string `s` and the integer `t` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters: `cut0` and `cut1`.
   - It iterates through the string `a` (except the last character) and checks for transitions:
     - `cut1` counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.
     - `cut0` counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - After counting the transitions, it checks if `cut0` is zero:
     - If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0' to '1' transitions, and the string is already sorted or can be sorted by cutting at '1' to '0' transitions. Therefore, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
     - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are both '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' transitions. The minimum number of pieces needed is the sum of both types of transitions (`cut0 + cut1`).

3. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case "11010":
     - Transitions: '1' to '0' at index 2, '1' to '0' at index 4.
     - `cut1 = 2`, `cut0 = 1`.
     - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For the second test case "00000000":
     - No transitions.
     - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
     - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For the third test case "1":
     - No transitions.
     - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
     - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For the fourth test case "10":
     - Transition: '1' to '0' at index 1.
     - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 0`.
     - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the fifth test case "0001111":
     - No transitions.
     - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
     - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For the sixth test case "0110":
     - Transitions: '0' to '1' at index 1, '1' to '0' at index 3.
     - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 1`.
     - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly counts the transitions and determines the minimum number of pieces needed based on the transitions.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
