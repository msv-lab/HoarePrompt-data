You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case.
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: `t` remains the same as the initial input by the user, `n` remains the same as the initial input by the user, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < N) is the sum of all elements from `pd[0]` to `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: `t` remains the same as the initial input by the user, `n` is the last input value provided by the user, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < N) is the sum of all elements from `pd[0]` to `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is designed to operate within a context where it processes inputs `t` and `n`, with `t` being an integer in the range 1 to 10^4 and `n` being an integer in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The specific return value or output of the function is not provided, but it is expected to return a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
