The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be part of a larger context where `t` and `n` are used as inputs, with `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n` being an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, if we assume that the function is designed to process these inputs, it might return some result based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function is designed to operate within a context where it processes inputs `t` and `n`, with `t` being an integer in the range 1 to 10^4 and `n` being an integer in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The specific return value or output of the function is not provided, but it is expected to return a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
