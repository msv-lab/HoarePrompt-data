Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in a list `pd`. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that the program can handle up to \(10^4\) test cases efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step is done only once, and each test case is handled in constant time by simply accessing the precomputed value. The logic for summing the digits and storing the cumulative sum is correct, and the program handles the edge cases (like `n = 1`, `n = 2`, etc.) as expected. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
