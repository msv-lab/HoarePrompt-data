Output State: **`t` remains the same as the initial input by the user, `n` is the last input value provided by the user, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < N) is the sum of all elements from `pd[0]` to `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` will be the last value input by the user during the loop's execution.
- `N` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `pd` remains the same as it was initially constructed, as the loop only reads from `pd` and does not modify it. Each iteration of the loop prints `pd[n]` for the current value of `n`, but `pd` itself is not altered.
