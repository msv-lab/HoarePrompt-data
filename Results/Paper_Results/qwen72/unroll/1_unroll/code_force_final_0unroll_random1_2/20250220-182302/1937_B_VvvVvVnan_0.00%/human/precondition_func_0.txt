The function should actually take parameters for the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the binary strings representing the grid. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, n, top_row, bottom_row):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the width of the grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `top_row` and `bottom_row` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
