Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described, but the function definition itself does not explicitly take any parameters. The input context should include a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then n lines of n characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
