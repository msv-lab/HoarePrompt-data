You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4b06bb9ff8f408edc96077ace0d5e299065a3c50.png)
Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described, but the function definition itself does not explicitly take any parameters. The input context should include a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then n lines of n characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case based on the input grid, and the variable `a` will be decremented by the number of iterations it has completed. The variable `k` will be reset to an empty list at the beginning of each iteration. The input grid and other variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of '0's and '1's. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. The function then counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid. If the first two rows have the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the input grid and other variables outside the function remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing a string of `n` characters (either `0` or `1`).

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function maintains a list `k` to store the count of `1`s in each row that contains at least one `1`.
   - It iterates through each row and appends the count of `1`s to the list `k` if the row contains any `1`s.

3. **Shape Determination**:
   - The function checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE" because the first and second rows of a square will have the same number of `1`s.
   - If they are not equal, it prints "TRIANGLE" because the first and second rows of a triangle will have different numbers of `1`s.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Shape Check**:
  - The function only checks the first two rows of the grid. This is not sufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid.
  - For a triangle, the number of `1`s should increase or decrease by 2 for each subsequent row (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7 for a triangle with `k=4`).
  - For a square, all rows should have the same number of `1`s.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle edge cases where the shape might be an upside-down triangle or a square that is not aligned with the grid's edges.

### Correctness:
- The provided program is **incorrect** because it only checks the first two rows and does not verify the entire shape. This can lead to incorrect results for grids where the shape is not aligned with the first two rows or where the shape is an upside-down triangle.

### Correctness: **False**
