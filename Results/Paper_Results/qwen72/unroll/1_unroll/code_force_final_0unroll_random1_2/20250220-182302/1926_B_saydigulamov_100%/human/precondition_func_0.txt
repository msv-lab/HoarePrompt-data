The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described, but the function definition itself does not explicitly take any parameters. The input context should include a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then n lines of n characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.
