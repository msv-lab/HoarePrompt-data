Reasoning:  
The program is designed to read multiple test cases, each representing a grid of size \( n \times n \) and determine if the shape formed by the '1's is a square or a triangle. The function `func` reads the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid \( n \) and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`. After collecting the counts, it checks if the first two counts are equal. If they are, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

However, this logic is flawed because it only checks the first two rows of the grid, which is insufficient to determine the shape for all cases. For example, a triangle with a base of 3 or more rows will not be correctly identified by this method, as the first two rows of a triangle with a base of 3 or more rows will not have the same number of '1's. Similarly, a square with more than 2 rows will also not be correctly identified if the first two rows do not have the same number of '1's, which could happen in a misaligned grid.

To correctly identify the shape, the program should:
1. Check if the counts in `k` form a sequence where each count is 2 more than the previous one (for a triangle) or all counts are the same (for a square).
2. Ensure that the shape is aligned properly, meaning the '1's are centered for a triangle or aligned along the left edge for a square.

Given that the current program only checks the first two rows, it will fail for many valid test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
