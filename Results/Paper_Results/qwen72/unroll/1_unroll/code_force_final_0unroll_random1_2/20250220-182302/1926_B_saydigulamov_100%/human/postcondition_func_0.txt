The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of '0's and '1's. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. The function then counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid. If the first two rows have the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the input grid and other variables outside the function remain unchanged.
