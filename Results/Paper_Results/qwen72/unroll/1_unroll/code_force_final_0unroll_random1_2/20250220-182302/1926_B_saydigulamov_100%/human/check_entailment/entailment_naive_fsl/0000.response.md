Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify the shape when the triangle or square is not aligned with the top of the grid. For example, consider the following grid:

```
Input:
1
4
0000
0000
1111
1111
```

The correct output should be "SQUARE" because the grid contains a 2x2 square of 1s. However, the program will output "TRIANGLE" because it only checks the first two rows that contain 1s, and does not consider the possibility that the shape might start from a different row. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
