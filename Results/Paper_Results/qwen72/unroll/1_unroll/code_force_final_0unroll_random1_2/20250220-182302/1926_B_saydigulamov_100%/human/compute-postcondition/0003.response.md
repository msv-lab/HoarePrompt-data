The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described: a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.

The function returns the shape found in each test case, which can be either "triangle" or "square".

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of '0's and '1's, and returns the shape ("triangle" or "square") found in each grid.**
