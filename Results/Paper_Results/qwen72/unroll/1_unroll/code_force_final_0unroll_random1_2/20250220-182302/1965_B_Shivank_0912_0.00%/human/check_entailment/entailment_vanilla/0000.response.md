### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and the pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Sequence Generation:**
   - The program generates a fixed sequence `sequence` consisting of the first 25 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because the sum of any subset of these powers of 2 is unique. This means that for any integer `v` that can be represented as a sum of these powers, there is exactly one subset of the sequence that sums to `v`.

3. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case `(n, k)`, the program appends the tuple `(25, sequence)` to the `results` list.
   - This means that for every test case, the program outputs a sequence of size 25, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` contains the first 25 powers of 2, which are all distinct and non-negative.
   - The sum of any subset of these powers of 2 is unique and can represent any integer from 0 to \(2^{25} - 1\).
   - Since \(2^{25} - 1\) is much larger than the maximum value of `n` (which is \(10^6\)), the sequence can represent any integer `v` in the range \(1 \le v \le n\) except for `k`.
   - To ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, the program relies on the fact that `k` is not a sum of any subset of the first 25 powers of 2. This is true because the sequence is designed to cover all possible sums up to \(2^{25} - 1\) uniquely.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values correctly.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will not have a subsequence that sums to 2, but it will have a subsequence that sums to 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs. The sequence is of size 25, which is within the allowed limit, and it ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a sum of a subsequence.

### Correctness:
**True**
