Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` in each tuple is a list of 25 elements, with each element being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0. Therefore, `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`.**
