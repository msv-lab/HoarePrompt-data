The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000. `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers where 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2, and they satisfy the equation na + nb + nc = n. `numbers` is a list of n positive integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns one of two cases:
- **Case_1**: If it is possible to distribute the numbers from the `numbers` list into three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that the lengths of these groups are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, and the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, the function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- **Case_2**: If such a distribution is not possible, the function returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`, and returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the numbers can be distributed into these groups such that the lengths are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, and the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
