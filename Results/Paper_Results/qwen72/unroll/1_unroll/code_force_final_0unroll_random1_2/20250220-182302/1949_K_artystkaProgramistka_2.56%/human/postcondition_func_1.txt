The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) such that the lengths of these groups are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. The function aims to distribute the numbers so that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`. If the distribution meets the criteria as determined by an external function `func_1`, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The original parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the `numbers` list is sorted in descending order.
