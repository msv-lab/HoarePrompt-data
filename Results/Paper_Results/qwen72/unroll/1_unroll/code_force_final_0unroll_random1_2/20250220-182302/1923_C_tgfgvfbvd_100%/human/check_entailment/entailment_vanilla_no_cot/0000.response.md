Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` keeps track of the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`.
     - `c` keeps track of the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` for the subarray `c[a]` to `c[b]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the count of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix sum array `c`.
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray `s` minus the length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic and conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem description, ensuring that the program correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not. Therefore, the program is correct.
