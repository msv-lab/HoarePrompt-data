Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of `q` queries, each query being a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function should also handle the constraints that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates over multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes an array `c` and a list of queries. After processing all the queries for a test case, the loop moves to the next test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are updated within the loop, but their final values at the end of the loop depend on the specific input for each test case. The output state of these variables is not predictable without the actual input data. However, the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `l` of positive integers and a list of queries `q`, where each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`. The function then computes and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions: if the subarray `l[l_i-1:r_i]` contains more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the final state of the program is that all queries for all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
