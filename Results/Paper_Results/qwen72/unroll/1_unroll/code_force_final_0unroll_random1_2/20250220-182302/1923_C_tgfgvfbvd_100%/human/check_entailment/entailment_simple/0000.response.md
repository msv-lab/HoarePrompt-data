### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - `p` is a prefix sum array for the elements of `c`.
   - `c` is a prefix sum array for the number of 1s in `c`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `s` and the number of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix sum arrays.
   - It then checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.

4. **Condition Explanation**:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for the subarray to be good (since `a_i` must be different from `b_i` for all `i`).
   - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray. This is necessary because if the subarray has `k` elements and `i` of them are 1s, the remaining elements must sum to at least `k - i` to allow for a valid array `b` where each `b_i` is different from `a_i` and greater than 0.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input, calculates the necessary prefix sums, and applies the conditions to determine if each subarray is good. The logic and conditions used are correct and align with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
