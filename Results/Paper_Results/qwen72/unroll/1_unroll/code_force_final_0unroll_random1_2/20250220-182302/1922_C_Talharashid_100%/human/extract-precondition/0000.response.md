Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
