The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between two specified cities. The function reads input from the user, including the number of test cases, the number of cities, the city coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It populates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, with the minimum travel costs for each city, and uses these dictionaries to compute the travel costs for the queries. The function does not modify the input values but prints the results of the queries directly.
