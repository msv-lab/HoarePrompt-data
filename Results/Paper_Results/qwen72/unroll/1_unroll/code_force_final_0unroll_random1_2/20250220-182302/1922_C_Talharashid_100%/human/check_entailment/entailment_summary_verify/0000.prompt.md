You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        d1[2] = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between two specified cities. The function reads input from the user, including the number of test cases, the number of cities, the city coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It populates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, with the minimum travel costs for each city, and uses these dictionaries to compute the travel costs for the queries. The function does not modify the input values but prints the results of the queries directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the distance between two consecutive cities is the same. According to the problem description, for every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. However, the program's logic for determining the closest city does not account for this uniqueness constraint. Specifically, the logic in the program assumes that the closest city is always the next or previous city, which is not always true if the distances are equal.

For example, consider the cities located at points [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In this case, the closest city to city 2 (at point 1) is both city 1 (at point 0) and city 3 (at point 2), which violates the uniqueness constraint. The program will incorrectly assume that the closest city to city 2 is city 3, leading to incorrect results for queries involving these cities.
