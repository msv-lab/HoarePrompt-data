Output State: **The loop has processed `cases` number of test cases. For each test case, it has read `na_frente` and `pos_final` as integers, and two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` of length `n`. It has then calculated the minimum cost to move from the position `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the provided costs, and printed this minimum cost. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` are reset for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, the loop has completed and the program has printed the minimum cost for each test case.**
