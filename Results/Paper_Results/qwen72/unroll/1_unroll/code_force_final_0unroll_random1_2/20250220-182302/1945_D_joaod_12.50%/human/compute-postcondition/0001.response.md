To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `c` and `cases`.

1. **Variable `c`**: This variable is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.
2. **Variable `cases`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9
- `cases` is an input integer

The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `c` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
