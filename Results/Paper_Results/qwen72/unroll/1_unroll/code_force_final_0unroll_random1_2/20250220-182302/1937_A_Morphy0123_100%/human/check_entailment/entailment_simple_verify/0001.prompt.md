You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:

            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:

- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be called with a parameter n, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop will print the largest power of 2 less than or equal to each input `n` for `n_cases` iterations. The variable `n_cases` will remain unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input value processed by the loop. The variable `power` will be the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the last input `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with an array \( a \) where \( a_i = i \) for \( 1 \le i \le n \).
   - We perform the operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - The operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) swaps the elements \( a_d \) and \( a_i \), where \( d \) is the largest divisor of \( i \) that is not equal to \( i \) itself.
   - We need to find the position of the element 1 in the resulting array.

2. **Analyzing the Swap Operation:**
   - For a number \( i \), the largest divisor \( d \) of \( i \) that is not equal to \( i \) itself is \( \frac{i}{2} \) if \( i \) is even, and \( d \) is the largest odd divisor if \( i \) is odd.
   - However, for the purpose of this problem, we only need to consider the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).

3. **Pattern Observation:**
   - When \( n \) is a power of 2, the element 1 will end up at position \( n \).
   - When \( n \) is not a power of 2, the element 1 will end up at the largest power of 2 less than \( n \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is 1, it prints 1 (since no swaps are performed).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) using the logarithm base 2.
   - It then prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \), where \(\text{power}\) is the largest integer such that \( 2^{\text{power}} \le n \).

5. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - The program uses \( \log_2(n) \) to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is exactly a power of 2, \( \log_2(n) \) will be an integer, and the program correctly prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \).
   - If \( n \) is not a power of 2, \( \log_2(n) \) will not be an integer, and the program correctly prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \) where \(\text{power}\) is the floor of \( \log_2(n) \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case \( n = 1 \) correctly by printing 1.
   - For \( n \) values that are not powers of 2, it correctly finds the largest power of 2 less than \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of the element 1 in the resulting array after performing the specified swaps. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
