The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n_cases`. If `n_cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `n_cases` is an integer input with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, which already ensures that `n_cases` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n_cases` to ensure the loop executes. However, `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer input, and 1 ≤ n_cases ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0**
