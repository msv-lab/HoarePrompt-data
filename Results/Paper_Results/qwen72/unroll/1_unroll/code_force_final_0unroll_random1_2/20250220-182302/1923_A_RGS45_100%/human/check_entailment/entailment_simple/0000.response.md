### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a list of integers `arr`.

2. **String Conversion**:
   - The function converts the input list `arr` into a string by joining the elements after splitting. This is done to facilitate the use of string methods like `find` and `count`.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon. The `[::-1]` reverses the string, so `find('1')` on the reversed string gives the index of the last chip from the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - The function then extracts the substring `z` from the first occurrence of a chip to the last occurrence of a chip. This is done using slicing: `arr[x:n - y]`.

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The function counts the number of free cells (0s) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the count of free cells between the first and last chip for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The logic of finding the first and last chip and then counting the free cells between them is correct for determining the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
  - The substring `z` correctly represents the segment of the ribbon between the first and last chip, and counting the zeros in this segment gives the number of free cells that need to be filled to form a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles cases where there are no free cells between the first and last chip (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1 1`).
  - It also handles cases where the ribbon is already in a single block (e.g., `0 1 0 0 0 0`).

- **Input Constraints**:
  - The function assumes valid inputs as described in the problem statement, and it correctly processes each test case.
