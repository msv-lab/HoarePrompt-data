Precondition: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), representing the state of the ribbon. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).**
