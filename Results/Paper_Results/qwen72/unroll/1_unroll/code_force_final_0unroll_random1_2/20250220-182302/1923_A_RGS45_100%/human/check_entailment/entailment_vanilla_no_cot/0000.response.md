Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a string `arr` (after removing spaces).

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: 
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) from the left.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) from the right by reversing the string and then finding the first '1'. This effectively gives the number of trailing zeros from the right.

3. **Extracting the Substring**: 
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, effectively removing any leading or trailing free cells (0s).

4. **Counting Free Cells in the Substring**: 
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0s) within this substring, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
