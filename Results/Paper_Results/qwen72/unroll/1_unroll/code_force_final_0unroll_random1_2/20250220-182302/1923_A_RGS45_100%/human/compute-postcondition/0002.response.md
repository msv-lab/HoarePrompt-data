Output State: **The function will print the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 in each test case for `t` iterations. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each iteration based on the input provided, but their values will not persist between iterations. After all iterations are complete, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last iteration, and the function will have printed the results for each test case.**
