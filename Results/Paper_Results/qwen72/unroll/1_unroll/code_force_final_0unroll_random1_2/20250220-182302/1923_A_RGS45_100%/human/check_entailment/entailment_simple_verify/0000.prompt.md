You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), representing the state of the ribbon. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The function will print the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 in each test case for `t` iterations. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each iteration based on the input provided, but their values will not persist between iterations. After all iterations are complete, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last iteration, and the function will have printed the results for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are no free cells to the left of the chip. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 0 0 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

Actual output:
```
0
```

The program incorrectly prints `0` because it does not account for the scenario where the first chip (at index 0) has no free cells to the left. The correct approach would be to move the chip from the last position (index 4) to the first position (index 0), which would require 4 operations. The program fails to handle this edge case and thus is incorrect.
