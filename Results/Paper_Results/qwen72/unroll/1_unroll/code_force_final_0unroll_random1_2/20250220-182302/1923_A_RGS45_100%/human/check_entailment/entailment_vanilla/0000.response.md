Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a string `arr` after removing spaces. This is done using `input('').split()` and then joining the resulting list into a single string.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (from the left) and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the first chip from the right. The `[::-1]` reverses the string, so `arr[::-1].find('1')` gives the index of the last chip from the original string. This is correct and efficient.

3. **Extracting the Substring**: The program then extracts the substring `z` that starts from the first chip and ends at the last chip. This is done using `arr[x:n - y]`. The `n - y` part correctly calculates the index of the last chip in the original string.

4. **Counting Free Cells**: The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. This is because the free cells within the block of chips are the ones that need to be filled by moving chips from the right to the left.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '01110110'`
  - `x = 1` (index of the first '1')
  - `y = 2` (index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string)
  - `z = '111011'` (substring from index 1 to index 6)
  - `z.count('0') = 1` (one '0' in the substring)
  - Output: `1` (correct)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - `arr = '010000'`
  - `x = 1` (index of the first '1')
  - `y = 5` (index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string)
  - `z = '1'` (substring from index 1 to index 1)
  - `z.count('0') = 0` (no '0' in the substring)
  - Output: `0` (correct)

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `arr = '111111'`
  - `x = 0` (index of the first '1')
  - `y = 0` (index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string)
  - `z = '111111'` (substring from index 0 to index 5)
  - `z.count('0') = 0` (no '0' in the substring)
  - Output: `0` (correct)

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
  - `arr = '10101'`
  - `x = 0` (index of the first '1')
  - `y = 0` (index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string)
  - `z = '10101'` (substring from index 0 to index 4)
  - `z.count('0') = 2` (two '0's in the substring)
  - Output: `2` (correct)

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '011000110'`
  - `x = 1` (index of the first '1')
  - `y = 2` (index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string)
  - `z = '1100011'` (substring from index 1 to index 6)
  - `z.count('0') = 3` (three '0's in the substring)
  - Output: `3` (correct)

All examples are correctly handled by the program. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
