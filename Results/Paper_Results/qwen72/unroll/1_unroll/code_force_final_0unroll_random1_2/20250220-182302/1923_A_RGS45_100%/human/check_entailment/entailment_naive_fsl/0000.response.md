Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are no free cells to the left of the chip. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 0 0 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

Actual output:
```
0
```

The program incorrectly prints `0` because it does not account for the scenario where the first chip (at index 0) has no free cells to the left. The correct approach would be to move the chip from the last position (index 4) to the first position (index 0), which would require 4 operations. The program fails to handle this edge case and thus is incorrect.
