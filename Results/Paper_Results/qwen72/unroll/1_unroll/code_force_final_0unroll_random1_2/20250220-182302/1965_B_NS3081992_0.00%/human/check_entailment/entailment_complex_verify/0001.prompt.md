You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers), `processing` (a list of integers initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers initialized to 0). The function returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and sets `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. The function ultimately returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`.

Here, `y` is one of the values returned by `func_13`, `x - (a // b) * y` is calculated using the integer division of `a` by `b` and the value of `x` from `func_13`, and `g` is another value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not 0). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `x` and `y` are integers, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and uses the results to compute the final tuple. The final state of the program is that the function has returned a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = g`, and `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a combination of binary representation and specific sequence construction to ensure the conditions are met.
   - The function `func_14` is the main function responsible for constructing the sequence.

3. **Breaking Down `func_14`:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - `(n, k) = func_7()` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - **Special Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1`, the function handles it separately:
       - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
       - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed by the powers of 2.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - The function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of `k`'s binary representation to the length of `n`'s binary representation.
     - This ensures that all values up to `n` except `k` can be formed by the sequence.

4. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The sequence elements are non-negative integers, which is also within the allowed range.

5. **Testing the Solution:**
   - The solution should be tested with various values of `n` and `k` to ensure it meets the conditions.
   - For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` is correct.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution appears to handle all the given constraints and test cases correctly.
   - The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values up to `n` can be formed.
