Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the new `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of the new `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation:
- `lk` is assigned the value of the length of `bk`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- Since `bk` is the binary representation of the new `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is simply the number of binary digits in `bk`.
- The condition that `k` is not equal to 1 is still valid.
