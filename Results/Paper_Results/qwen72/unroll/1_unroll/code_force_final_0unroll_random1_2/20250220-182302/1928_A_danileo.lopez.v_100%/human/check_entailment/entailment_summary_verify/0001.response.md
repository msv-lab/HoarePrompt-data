### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle, considering that rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles.
   - The new rectangle formed by combining these two smaller rectangles should be different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the two resulting rectangles will be \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\). If \(\frac{a}{2} \neq b\), then the new rectangle \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\) is different from \(a \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the two resulting rectangles will be \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). If \(\frac{b}{2} \neq a\), then the new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) is different from \(a \times b\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the answer is always "No".
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the only possible cuts will result in rectangles of size \(1 \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{a}{2} \times 1\), which are the same as the original when rotated, so the answer is "No".

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(\frac{a}{2} \neq b\). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(\frac{b}{2} \neq a\). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "No".

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd by printing "No".
   - It correctly handles the case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - The program also correctly handles the edge case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, ensuring that the answer is "No" in such cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
