You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from user input. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, and if so, it prints 'Yes'. If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, and if so, it prints 'Yes'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle, considering that rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90° rotation.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - The new rectangle formed by combining these two smaller rectangles should be different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the two resulting rectangles will be \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \). If \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \), then the new rectangle \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \) is different from \(a \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the two resulting rectangles will be \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). If \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \), then the new rectangle \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) is different from \(a \times b\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the answer is always "No".
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the only possible cuts will result in rectangles of size \(1 \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{a}{2} \times 1\), which are the same as the original when rotated, so the answer is "No".

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(\frac{a}{2} \neq b\). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(\frac{b}{2} \neq a\). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "No".

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd by printing "No".
   - It correctly handles the case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - The program also correctly handles the edge case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, ensuring that the answer is "No" in such cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description and constraints.
