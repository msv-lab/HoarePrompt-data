The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function should return a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints.

Given the lack of specific output details, we can infer that the function is designed to process these test cases and return some form of output based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).**
