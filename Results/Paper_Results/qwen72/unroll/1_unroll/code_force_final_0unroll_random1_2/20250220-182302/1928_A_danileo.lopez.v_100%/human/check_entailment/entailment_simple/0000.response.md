Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then reassembling them. The key to solving this problem lies in the dimensions of the original rectangle and how it can be cut.

1. **Even Dimensions Check**: The program first checks if either dimension \( a \) or \( b \) is even. If at least one dimension is even, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it prints "No" because a rectangle with both odd dimensions cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can form a different rectangle.

2. **Cutting and Forming New Rectangles**:
   - If \( a \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \( b \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, it checks if the new dimensions formed by reassembling the two smaller rectangles are different from the original dimensions \( a \times b \).

3. **Output**:
   - If the new dimensions are different, it prints "Yes".
   - If the new dimensions are the same as the original, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangle, both dimensions are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".
   - For a \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangle, one dimension is even, but the only possible cut results in two \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle, so the program correctly prints "No".
   - For a \( 2 \times 6 \) rectangle, one dimension is even, and the cut results in two \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \( 4 \times 3 \) rectangle, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - For a \( 3 \times 2 \) rectangle, one dimension is even, and the cut results in two \( 3 \times 1 \) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \( 1 \times 6 \) rectangle, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - For a \( 2 \times 2 \) rectangle, both dimensions are even, and the cut results in two \( 1 \times 2 \) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \( 1 \times 4 \) rectangle, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - For a \( 2 \times 4 \) rectangle, one dimension is even, and the cut results in two \( 2 \times 2 \) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \( 4 \times 2 \) rectangle, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - For a \( 6 \times 3 \) rectangle, one dimension is even, but the only possible cut results in two \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle, so the program correctly prints "No".

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
