### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Time Parsing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` which is in the format `hh:mm`.
   - It extracts the hour part `h` using `s[:2]`.

3. **Hour Conversion:**
   - If the hour `h` is `00`, it prints `12` (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary using `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

4. **Minute and AM/PM Handling:**
   - It prints the minute part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on whether the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Hour Conversion:**
  - The code correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
  - For `00`, it correctly prints `12`.
  - For hours `01` to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
  - For hours `13` to `23`, it correctly subtracts `12` and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.

- **Minute Handling:**
  - The code correctly prints the minute part `s[2:]` without any modifications, which is appropriate since the minute format is the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

- **AM/PM Determination:**
  - The code correctly determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on the hour value.

### Edge Cases:

- **Midnight (00:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `00:00` to `12:00 AM`.

- **Noon (12:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `12:00` to `12:00 PM`.

- **Hours 13 to 23:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `13` to `23` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `PM`.

- **Hours 01 to 11:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `01` to `11` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `AM`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
