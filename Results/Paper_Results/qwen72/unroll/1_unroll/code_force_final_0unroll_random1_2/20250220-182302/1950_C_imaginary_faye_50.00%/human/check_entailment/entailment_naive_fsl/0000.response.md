Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is '12' correctly. According to the problem description, '12:00' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 PM' in 12-hour format, but the program will output '12:00 AM' because it does not account for the specific condition where the hour is '12' and should always be 'PM'. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the hour is '00' correctly. The program correctly converts '00:59' to '12:59 AM', but it does not convert '00:00' to '12:00 AM'. Instead, it will output '12:00 AM' for both '00:00' and '00:59', which is incorrect for '00:00' as it should be '12:00 AM'.

To fix these issues, the program should have specific conditions to handle '12' and '00' hours correctly.
