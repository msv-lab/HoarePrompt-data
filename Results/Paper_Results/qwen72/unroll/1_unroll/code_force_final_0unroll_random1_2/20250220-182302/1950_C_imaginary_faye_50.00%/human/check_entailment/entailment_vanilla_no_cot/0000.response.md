Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct handling of the transition between AM and PM. Here is a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format `hh:mm`.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The program extracts the hours `h` from the first two characters of the string `s`.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If the hours are `00`, it prints `12` to handle the midnight case.
   - If the hours are between `01` and `12`, it prints the hours as they are.
   - If the hours are between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hours and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.

4. **Printing Minutes and AM/PM:**
   - The program prints the minutes part of the string `s` starting from the third character.
   - It appends "AM" if the hours are less than 12, and "PM" if the hours are 12 or greater.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, such as `00:00` (midnight) and `12:00` (noon). Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.
