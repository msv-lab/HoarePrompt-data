The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the list `a` and the string `s`.
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) used as the modulus for the product calculations.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is the product of the corresponding element in `b` and all subsequent elements in `b`, modulo `m`. The list is reversed before being returned.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a reversed list of integers, where each integer is the product of the corresponding element in `b` and all subsequent elements in `b`, modulo `m`. The length of the returned list is `n`.**
