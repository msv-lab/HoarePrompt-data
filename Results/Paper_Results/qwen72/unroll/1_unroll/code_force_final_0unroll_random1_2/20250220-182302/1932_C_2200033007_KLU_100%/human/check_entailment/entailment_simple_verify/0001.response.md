### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that elements are removed from `a` in the order specified by `s`.

4. **Calculating the Product Modulo:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the last element removed should be the first one considered in the product).
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m` and appends `p` to `ans`.
   - This part of the program is also correct. By iterating in reverse, it ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, starting from the last removed element and moving towards the first.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.
   - The `reversed(ans)` ensures that the output is in the correct order as specified in the problem description.

### Validation of Annotations:
- **State before function call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
  - `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4).
  - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
  - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **State after processing commands:**
  - `b` is a list of `n` integers where elements are taken from `a` in the order specified by `s`.
  - `l` is `n` and `r` is `-1` after processing all commands.
  - This is correct. The pointers `l` and `r` are updated correctly to reflect the removal of elements from the array `a`.

- **State after calculating the product modulo:**
  - `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `b` and all subsequent elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
  - `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
  - This is correct. The product is calculated correctly and appended to `ans` in reverse order.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly processes the commands and maintains the state of the array `a` as elements are removed.
- The product modulo `m` is calculated correctly for each state of the array.
- The results are returned in the correct order as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
