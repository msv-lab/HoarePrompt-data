### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

4. **Calculating the Product Modulo:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the last element removed should be the first one considered in the product).
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m` and appends `p` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
  - `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4).
  - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
  - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

- **State After Command Execution:**
  - `b` is a list of `n` integers where elements are taken from `a` in the order specified by `s`.
  - `l` is `n` (indicating the left pointer has moved to the end of the array).
  - `r` is `-1` (indicating the right pointer has moved to the start of the array).

- **State After Product Calculation:**
  - `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `b` and all subsequent elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
  - `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the input as described.

- **Processing the Commands:**
  - The program correctly processes the commands and maintains the state of the array `a` as elements are removed.

- **Calculating the Product Modulo:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product modulo `m` for each state of the array.
  - The results are stored in `ans` in the correct order.

- **Output:**
  - The program returns the results in the correct order as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the commands, maintains the state of the array, calculates the product modulo `m` for each state, and returns the results in the correct order.

Final: **True**
