### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The variable `k` is initialized to 1.
   - The first loop iterates from `i = 2` to `n-1` and makes queries to find the index `k` such that `p_k` is the maximum value in the permutation. This is done by comparing `p_0 | p_k` with `p_0 | p_i` for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`.
   - If `p_0 | p_k` is less than `p_0 | p_i`, `k` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Best Pair for Maximum XOR:**
   - The variable `best` is initialized to 0.
   - The second loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1` and makes queries to find the index `best` such that `p_k | p_best` is maximized among all pairs `(p_k, p_i)`.
   - If `p_k | p_best` is less than `p_k | p_i`, `best` is updated to `i`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After the loops, the function prints the indices `k` and `best` in the format `! k best`, which are supposed to be the indices that maximize `p_k âŠ• p_best`.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes `n-2` queries.
   - The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
   - The total number of queries for each test case is `(n-2) + (n-1) = 2n - 3`, which is less than `3n` and thus meets the query limit requirement.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop ensures that `k` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop ensures that `best` is the index of the value that, when combined with `p_k`, maximizes the bitwise OR.
   - However, the goal is to maximize the bitwise XOR, not the bitwise OR. The algorithm does not directly address the XOR operation, which is the key requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The algorithm correctly finds the maximum value in the permutation and the best pair for the bitwise OR, but it does not ensure that the bitwise XOR is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
