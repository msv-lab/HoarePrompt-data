### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Approach:**
   - The program starts by iterating over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes \(k\) to 1 and iterates over the indices from 2 to \(n-1\).

3. **First Loop:**
   - The program asks queries of the form \(? 0 k 0 i\) to compare \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_0 \mid p_k) < (p_0 \mid p_i)\), it updates \(k\) to \(i\).
   - This loop ensures that \(k\) is the index such that \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) is the maximum among all \((p_0 \mid p_i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).

4. **Second Loop:**
   - The program initializes \(best\) to 0 and iterates over the indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - It asks queries of the form \(? k best k i\) to compare \((p_k \mid p_{best})\) with \((p_k \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_k \mid p_{best}) < (p_k \mid p_i)\), it updates \(best\) to \(i\).
   - This loop ensures that \(best\) is the index such that \((p_k \mid p_{best})\) is the maximum among all \((p_k \mid p_i)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, the program outputs the indices \(k\) and \(best\) as the answer.

6. **Query Count Analysis:**
   - The first loop runs \(n-2\) times (from 2 to \(n-1\)).
   - The second loop runs \(n-1\) times (from 1 to \(n-1\)).
   - The total number of queries is \(n-2 + n-1 = 2n-3\), which is less than \(3n\) for \(n \geq 2\).

7. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The program correctly identifies the indices \(k\) and \(best\) such that \(p_k \oplus p_{best}\) is maximized.
   - The number of queries used is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
