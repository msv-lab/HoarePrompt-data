The function `func` is an interactive function that operates on multiple test cases. Each test case involves a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. It returns the two indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j for each test case.
