Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a good practice to ensure the input is clean.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`. It then iterates through the string `s`, calculating the balance at each position and appending the tuple to `prefix_balance`. The balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis '(' and decremented for a closing parenthesis ')'.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on the balance in ascending order. If two positions have the same balance, it sorts them in descending order of position. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This results in the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` processes the input string and returns a rearranged version that maintains the balance of parentheses as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
