#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))

    #State: Output State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance at the start of the iteration, the index of the current character, and the current character itself; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string composed of the third elements of each tuple in `prefix_balance` concatenated together.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")", with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a string that is a rearranged version of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position. The returned string maintains the same characters as `s` but may have a different order, ensuring that the balance of parentheses is preserved.
