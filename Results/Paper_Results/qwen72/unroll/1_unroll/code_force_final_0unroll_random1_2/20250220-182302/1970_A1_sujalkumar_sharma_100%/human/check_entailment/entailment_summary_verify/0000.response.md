### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string `s`. The prefix balance is updated by incrementing it for each opening parenthesis '(' and decrementing it for each closing parenthesis ')'.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates through the string and appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the `prefix_balance` list, where `balance` is the current prefix balance, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The `prefix_balance` list is then sorted using a custom key. The key is a lambda function that sorts the list based on the prefix balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, based on the position in descending order.
   - This sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the function constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - The result string is then returned.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main program reads the input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and passes it to `func_1`.
   - The result of `func_1` is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case of a single character (either '(' or ')') correctly. For a single character, the prefix balance is 0, and the position is 0, so the character remains in the same position.
   - The program also handles the case of a string with equal numbers of opening and closing parentheses, ensuring that the balance is maintained and the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input constraints and produces the correct output for all potential cases, including edge cases.

Final: **True**
