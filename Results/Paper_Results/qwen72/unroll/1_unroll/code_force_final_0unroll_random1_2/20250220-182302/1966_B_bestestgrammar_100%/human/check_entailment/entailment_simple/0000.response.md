### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function starts by assuming that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).

3. **Corner Case Check:**
   - The function checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`) are different colors.
   - If they are different, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True` and checks the first row and the last row for any adjacent cells that are different colors.
   - If any adjacent cells in the first or last row are different, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the first and last rows, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - It then repeats the same check for the first column and the last column.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Corner Case Check:**
  - The function checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors. If they are, it further checks if the entire first row and last row are the same color, and if the entire first column and last column are the same color.
  - If any of these checks fail, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
  - This logic is based on the idea that if the corners are different and the entire first or last row/column is not uniform, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform with the given operations.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where the grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B').
  - It also handles the case where the grid is a single cell (1x1), which is always uniform.

### Potential Issues:

- **Logic Flaw:**
  - The function's logic for determining if it is impossible to make the grid uniform is flawed. Specifically, the check for `impossible` only considers the first and last rows and columns. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
  - For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but the middle of the grid has a different pattern that could still be made uniform. The function would incorrectly output 'NO' in such cases.

### Correct Logic:

- To correctly determine if the grid can be made uniform, we need to check if there is any way to select two squares of the same color such that the entire grid can be covered by operations starting from those squares.
- A simpler and more correct approach is to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both colors are present, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform. If only one color is present, it is possible.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        has_w = any('W' in row for row in gr)
        has_b = any('B' in row for row in gr)
        
        ans = 'YES' if has_w != has_b else 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

- The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible grid configurations.
- The corrected program checks if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, which is a more robust approach.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
