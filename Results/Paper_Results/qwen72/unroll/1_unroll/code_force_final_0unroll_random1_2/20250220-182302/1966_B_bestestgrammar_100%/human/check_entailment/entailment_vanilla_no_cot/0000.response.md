Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program checks if the corners of the grid are the same color and then checks if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are uniform in color. However, this does not cover all scenarios where it is possible to make the entire grid one color.

For example, consider a grid where the corners are different colors, but there is a way to make the entire grid one color by selecting appropriate subrectangles. The program would incorrectly output "NO" in such cases.

A correct approach would be to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both colors are present, then it is impossible to make the entire grid one color using the given operations. If only one color is present, then the grid is already uniform, and the answer is "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        # Check if both 'W' and 'B' are present in the grid
        has_w = any('W' in row for row in gr)
        has_b = any('B' in row for row in gr)
        
        if has_w and has_b:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if the grid can be made uniform and outputs the correct result for all test cases.
