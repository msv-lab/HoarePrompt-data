Functionality: **The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string in the grid represents a row and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions are given by integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid configuration.**
