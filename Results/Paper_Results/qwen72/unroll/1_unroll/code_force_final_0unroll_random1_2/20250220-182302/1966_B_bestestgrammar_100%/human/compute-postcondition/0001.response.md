The only objects in the loop head are the variable `tc` and the input integer `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `tc` is not initialized, so it needs to be set to 0 for the loop to begin.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
