The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list `l` of distinct integers of length `n` (where `n` is at least twice `c`). It swaps the (c-1)-th element and the c-th last element of the list `l` and returns the modified list. After the function call, the (c-1)-th element of `l` is the value that was originally at the c-th last position, and the c-th last element of `l` is the value that was originally at the (c-1)-th position.
