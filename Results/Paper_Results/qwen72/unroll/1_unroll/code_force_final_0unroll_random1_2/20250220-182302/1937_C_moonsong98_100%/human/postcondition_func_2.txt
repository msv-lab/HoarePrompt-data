The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. If `n` is 2, it calls `func_2(0, 1)` and returns. Otherwise, it determines the index of the maximum element (`max_index`) and the index of the minimum element (`min_index`) in a sequence of `n` elements, which are compared using `func_1`. The function then calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)`. The final state of the program is that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element, and `min_index` is the index of the minimum element among the elements that are equal to or less than the element at `max_index`.
