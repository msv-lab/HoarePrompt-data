The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, this already ensures that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but the loop will start with `i` being 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0**
