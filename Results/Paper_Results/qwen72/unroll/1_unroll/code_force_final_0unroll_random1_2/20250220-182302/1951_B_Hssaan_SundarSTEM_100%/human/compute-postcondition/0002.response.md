The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, a list of tuples, and a list of lists. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list of tuples contains `t` tuples, each with two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The list of lists contains `t` inner lists, each with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and all `a_i`'s are pairwise different.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if your cow (indexed by `k`) has the highest Cowdeforces rating among all the cows. If your cow has the highest rating, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of cows and your cow's index, and a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if your cow has the highest rating in the corresponding test case, and "No" otherwise.**
