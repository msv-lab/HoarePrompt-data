You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

    7 2 727 10 12 13

    1000000000 1

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k-1`, along with a list of Cowdeforces ratings `s` for the cows. It calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be in front of your cow without any of them having a higher rating than your cow. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is the sequence of printed results, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the number of cows `n` and the index of the owner's cow `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ratings `s`.

2. **Initial Swap**:
   - The program swaps the rating of the owner's cow with the first cow's rating. This is done to simulate the scenario where the owner's cow is placed at the start of the list.
   - This swap is performed using the line: `(s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])`.

3. **First Simulation**:
   - The program then simulates the matches starting from the first position.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of wins.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the first cow (which is now the owner's cow after the swap).
   - It iterates through the list `s[1:]` to count how many matches the owner's cow can win.
   - If the owner's cow loses, the loop breaks, and the number of wins is stored in `ans`.

4. **Revert Swap**:
   - The program reverts the initial swap to restore the original list of ratings.

5. **Optimal Swap**:
   - The program then finds the optimal position `p` to swap the owner's cow to maximize the number of wins.
   - It sets `p` to the position where the owner's cow would lose if it were placed at the start.
   - It performs the swap using the line: `(s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])`.

6. **Second Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the matches again starting from the first position with the owner's cow at the optimal position.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will count the number of wins in this scenario.
   - It sets `z` to 0, which is a flag to indicate if the owner's cow has been encountered in the list.
   - It iterates through the list `s` to count how many matches the owner's cow can win.
   - If the owner's cow loses, the loop breaks, and the number of wins is stored in `ans1`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins between the two scenarios (`ans` and `ans1`).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the swapping and simulation of matches.
- It considers both scenarios: the owner's cow at the start and the owner's cow at the optimal position.
- The logic for determining the optimal position and counting the wins is sound.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where the owner's cow is already in the optimal position (i.e., it is the highest-rated cow in the first `k` positions). However, this is not a critical issue as the program will still correctly count the wins in both scenarios and choose the maximum.
- The program could be optimized to avoid redundant swaps, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
