This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The input constraints are: 1 <= t <= 10^4, 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
        
        ans = x - 2
        
        st = set(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        for i in range(x):
            t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
            t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
            if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
                ans += 1
        
        odd = []
        
        even = []
        
        for i in range(x):
            next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
            gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
            if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
                odd.append(gap)
            elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
                even.append(gap)
        
        odd.sort()
        
        even.sort()
        
        for gap in odd:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        
        for gap in even:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from input, processes a list of `x` integers representing Bessie's chosen vertices, and prints the value of `ans` which is calculated based on the conditions described in the loop. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not preserved, and the only output is the sequence of `ans` values printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional vertices `y` from the input. It also reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie. The function calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid moves Bessie can make, considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices `y`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not preserve the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of chosen vertices.
