### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The list `a` is adjusted to be 0-indexed, which is a common practice in Python for easier manipulation.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because a polygon with `x` vertices can be divided into `x - 2` triangles by drawing diagonals from a single vertex.

3. **Set and Sorting:**
   - The chosen vertices are stored in a set `st` for quick lookup.
   - The list `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive vertices.

4. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The function calculates gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list `a`. It considers the case where the gap wraps around the polygon.
   - Gaps are categorized into `odd` and `even` lists based on their parity.

5. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The function iterates over the `odd` gaps and tries to add as many vertices as possible to maximize the number of triangles.
   - If the remaining `y` is less than half the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half the gap.
   - The same process is repeated for the `even` gaps.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem.
- The logic for calculating the gaps and categorizing them into `odd` and `even` lists is sound.
- The approach to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices to the gaps is logically consistent with the problem's requirements.
- The function correctly updates `ans` and `y` based on the gaps and the number of additional vertices available.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described, and the logic and implementation are consistent with the requirements.
