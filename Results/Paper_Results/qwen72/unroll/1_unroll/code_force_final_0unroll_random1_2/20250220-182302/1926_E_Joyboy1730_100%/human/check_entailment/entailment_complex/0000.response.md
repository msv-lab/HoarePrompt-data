### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **List `L` Construction**:
   - The list `L` is constructed to store the number of cards that can be laid down in each step.
   - The loop `while n:` is used to repeatedly calculate the number of cards that are odd, twice an odd, three times an odd, and so on, until all cards are accounted for.
   - The calculation `m = (n + 1) // 2` correctly determines the number of cards that are multiples of the current power of 2 and are odd.
   - The update `n -= m` correctly subtracts the number of cards laid down in the current step from `n`.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - The variable `tot` is used to keep track of the cumulative number of cards laid down.
   - The variable `pow` is used to keep track of the current power of 2.
   - The loop `for a in L:` iterates through the list `L` to find the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:` checks if the k-th card is in the current step.
   - The calculation `print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))` correctly determines the value of the k-th card in the current step.
   - The update `tot += a` correctly increments the cumulative number of cards laid down.
   - The update `pow *= 2` correctly moves to the next power of 2 for the next step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will only lay down the card 1.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is large and `k` is the last card correctly, as it will eventually find the correct step and print the correct card.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct k-th card for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
