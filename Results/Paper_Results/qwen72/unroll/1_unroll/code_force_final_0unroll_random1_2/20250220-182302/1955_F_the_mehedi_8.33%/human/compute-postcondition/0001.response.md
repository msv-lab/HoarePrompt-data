Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration, the variable `cnt` is calculated based on the input sequence `a`. After all iterations, the final output for each sequence `a` is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each integer in `a` by 2. The values of `p_i` in the sequence `a` are not retained after each iteration.**
