The function `func` processes a series of input sequences, each containing four integers `p_i` (where 0 <= p_i <= 200), for a total of `t` iterations (where 1 <= t <= 10^4). For each sequence, it calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in the sequence are equal and odd) and the floor division of each integer in the sequence by 2. The function then prints this calculated value for each sequence. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `p_i` in each sequence are not retained after processing.
