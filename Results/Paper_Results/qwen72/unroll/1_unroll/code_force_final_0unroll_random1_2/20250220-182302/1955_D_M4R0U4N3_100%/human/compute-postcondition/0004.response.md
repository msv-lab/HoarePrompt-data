The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the relationship 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` and `b` are lists of integers where `a` has length `n` and `b` has length `m`, with elements in the range 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of lengths `n` and `m` respectively, with elements between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
