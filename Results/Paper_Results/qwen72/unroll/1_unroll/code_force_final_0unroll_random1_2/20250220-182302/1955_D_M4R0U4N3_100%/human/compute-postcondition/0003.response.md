Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a and b are lists of integers where a has length n and b has length m, with elements in the range 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the outer loop.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are reset in each iteration of the outer loop, so they retain their initial properties.
- `a` and `b` are read in each iteration of the outer loop, so they retain their initial properties.
- `max_val` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `cnt_b` is reset to all zeros at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, so it will be a list of length 1000001 with all elements initialized to 0 after the loop finishes.
