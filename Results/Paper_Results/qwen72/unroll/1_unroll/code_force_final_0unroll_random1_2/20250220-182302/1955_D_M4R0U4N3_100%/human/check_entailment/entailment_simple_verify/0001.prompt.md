You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a global `cnt_b` list to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`. This list is initialized to have a length of `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is 1,000,000) to cover the range of possible values in `b`.
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Count for Array `b`**:
   - The program increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` list. This helps in quickly checking how many elements in a subarray of `a` match the elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - The program initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements in the current subarray of `a` that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - It then checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (i.e., `a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (i.e., `a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after each slide, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts**:
   - After processing each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
- The use of `cnt_b` and `b_values` ensures that the program can quickly determine the number of matching elements in each subarray.
- The logic for updating `curr` and `ans` is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as resetting the counts for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
