You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1

                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
        for i in b_values:
            cnt_b[i] = 0



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` (of length `n`) and `b` (of length `m`). It then counts how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in `b`. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function resets the count array `cnt_b` to zero for all elements in the set `b_values`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical issue in the way it updates the `curr` variable when sliding the window over the array `a`. Specifically, the condition `if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:` should be `if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:` to correctly decrement `curr` when the element at `a[i]` is no longer part of the window. However, this alone does not fix the issue entirely.

The main problem lies in the way the `cnt_b` array is used and reset. The `cnt_b` array is used to count the occurrences of elements in `b`, but it is not reset properly for each test case. This can lead to incorrect results in subsequent test cases because the counts from the previous test case might still be present in `cnt_b`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
3
```

In the second test case, the program incorrectly counts the subsegments as good because the `cnt_b` array still contains the counts from the first test case, leading to incorrect results. To fix this, the `cnt_b` array should be reset to zero for each test case.
