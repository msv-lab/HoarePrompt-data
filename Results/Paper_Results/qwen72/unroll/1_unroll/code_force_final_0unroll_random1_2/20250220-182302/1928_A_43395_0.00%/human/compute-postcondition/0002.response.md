The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers with the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as the product of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both integers within the range 1 to 10^9, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It returns the area of the rectangle.**
