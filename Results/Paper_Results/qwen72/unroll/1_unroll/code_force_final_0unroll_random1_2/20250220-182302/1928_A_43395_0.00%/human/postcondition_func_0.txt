The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a series of inputs from the user, where the first input specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. Based on the conditions provided, it prints 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of dimensions. The values of `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration, but no initial parameters are provided or modified. The function's purpose is to determine and print whether certain conditions related to the dimensions of the rectangle are met.
