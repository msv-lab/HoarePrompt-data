The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^8` and `1 <= k <= 4n - 2`. The function is called `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, the function prints a result based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1, it prints 1; if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`; otherwise, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
