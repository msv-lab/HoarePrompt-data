Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program handles the special case where `k` is 1 by printing 1. This is correct because if `k` is 1, only one cell needs to be colored to satisfy the condition.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program uses a condition to check if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`. This condition is intended to cover the cases where `k` is within the range of the total number of diagonals.
   - If `k` is within this range, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is based on the idea that each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is the ceiling of `k / 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds this range, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is intended to handle the cases where more than half of the diagonals need to be covered, and the additional cell is needed to ensure all required diagonals are covered.

4. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The formula `2 * (n + (n - 2))` simplifies to `4n - 4`, which is the total number of diagonals minus the two main diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). This is correct because each of these two main diagonals is counted twice in `4n - 2`.
   - The use of `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2 + 1` is mathematically sound for the given problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `k` is 1.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals, which is `4n - 2`.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the output is `2`.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output is `2`.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the output is `6`.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the output is `5`.
     - For `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the output is `4`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 11`, the output is `6`.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
