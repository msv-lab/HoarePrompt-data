The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n` and `k`, and the function is called `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints: `2 <= n <= 10^8` and `1 <= k <= 4n - 2`.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints, it is likely that the function returns a result for each test case, possibly related to some computation involving `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^8` and `1 <= k <= 4n - 2`. The function is called `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
