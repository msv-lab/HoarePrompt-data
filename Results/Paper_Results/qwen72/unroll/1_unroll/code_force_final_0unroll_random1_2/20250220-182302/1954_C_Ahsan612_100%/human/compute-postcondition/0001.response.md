Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two lines of input representing the integers `x` and `y` as lists of digits. For each pair of integers, it will print two lines: the first line will be the maximum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will be the minimum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged, but the loop will have processed `t` test cases.**
