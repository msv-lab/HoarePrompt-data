### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - The function first checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1. If it is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the game's outcome does not depend solely on the first element of the array.
   - The function then creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` and iterates through this list to check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If `not_c` remains `True` after the loop, it toggles the value of `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game is a variation of the Nim game where players can remove a fixed number of stones from all non-empty piles.
   - The key to determining the winner is to check if the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd or even.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the game's outcome is determined by the first element of `arr` and the differences between consecutive unique elements.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determine the winner based on the parity of this count.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. It should count the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determine the winner based on the parity of this count, rather than checking the first element and the differences between consecutive unique elements.
