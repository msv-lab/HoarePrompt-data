Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of piles and the list of stones in each pile. This part of the code is correct and aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner based on the given rules.
   - The initial check `if arr[0] != 1` is incorrect. The function should check if the smallest pile is 1, not the first element of the list. This is because the order of the piles does not matter, and the smallest pile could be at any position in the list.
   - The function then creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. This is a correct approach to determine if the piles are in a sequence where each pile has one more stone than the previous one.
   - The variable `A` is used to toggle between `True` and `False` based on the number of consecutive differences of 1. This is a correct approach to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of such differences.
   - If all differences are exactly 1, the function toggles `A` one more time, which is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`, which is correct.

However, the initial check `if arr[0] != 1` is a critical error. The correct check should be `if min(arr) != 1` to ensure that the smallest pile is considered correctly.

Given this critical error, the program will not always produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
