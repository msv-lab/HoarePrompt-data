To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`. The loop will execute if `mex` is a non-empty list. The state of `itm` is not something we can adjust directly; it will be assigned the values from `mex` as the loop iterates.

Given the initial state:
- `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the current `minn` value (if `arr[i]` is positive) or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` (if `arr[i]` is non-positive).
- `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been added to the `used` dictionary.
- `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.

For the loop to execute, `mex` must have at least one element. The state of `itm` is not relevant at this point because it will be assigned values from `mex` during the loop execution.

State: **`mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `itm` is not yet defined**
