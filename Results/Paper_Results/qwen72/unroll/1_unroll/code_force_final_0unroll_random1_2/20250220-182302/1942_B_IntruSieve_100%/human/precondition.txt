The function `what_the_mex` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array a of length n with elements a_i (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.
