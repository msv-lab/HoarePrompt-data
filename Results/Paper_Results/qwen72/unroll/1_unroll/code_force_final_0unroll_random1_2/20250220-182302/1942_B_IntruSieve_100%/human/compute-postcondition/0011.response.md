The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- There is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, it is likely that the function returns some form of processed result or a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met, but without more specific details, we can only describe the parameters and the general nature of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a`, a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided constraints.**
