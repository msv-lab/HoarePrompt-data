You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: Output State: `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the current `minn` value (if `arr[i]` is positive) or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` (if `arr[i]` is non-positive). `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been added to the `used` dictionary. `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The elements of `mex` are printed in the order they appear in the list, separated by spaces. The values of `minn` and `used` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It processes `arr` to generate a list `mex` of integers, where each element is determined based on the current smallest non-negative integer (`minn`) that has not been used and the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is positive, the current `minn` is added to `mex` and marked as used. If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is added to `mex` and marked as used. The function then prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization and Basic Logic**:
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` as 0.
   - It also initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of used elements.

2. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the input array:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and marks `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used.
   - This logic does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given `a`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 -2 1 2
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     0 1 3 2 4
     ```
   - However, the correct output should be:
     ```
     0 1 4 2 3
     ```
   - Let's verify the output:
     - For `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`:
       - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
       - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
       - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
       - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
       - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`
     - The program's output `p = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]` does not satisfy the conditions:
       - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -1` (not -2)
       - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2) - 2 = 1` (correct)
       - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2, 4) - 4 = 0` (not 2)

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
