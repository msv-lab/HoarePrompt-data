### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each representing a row in the transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an extra empty string at the beginning to make the indices match the problem's 1-based indexing.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
   - The program iterates through each row and column of the input matrix.
   - If a character is 'F', it increments the count in both `a` and `b` for the corresponding indices.
   - If a character is 'S', it increments the count in both `a` and `b` for the corresponding indices.

3. **Identifying Rows and Columns**:
   - The program then identifies rows and columns that have at least one 'F' and no 'S' (stored in `sa`), and rows and columns that have at least one 'S' and no 'F' (stored in `sb`).

4. **Handling Undecided Characters**:
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the program adds rows and columns with no 'F' and no 'S' to `sa`.
   - It then iterates through each row and column, replacing '?' with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise replacing '?' with 'S'.
   - If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the program adds rows and columns with no 'F' and no 'S' to `sb`.
   - It then iterates through each row and column, replacing '?' with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, otherwise replacing '?' with 'F'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Analysis:

- **Symmetry and Diagonal Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the symmetry of the matrix and the diagonal (no transitions).
  
- **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
  - The program correctly counts the 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column.
  
- **Handling Undecided Characters**:
  - The program's logic for replacing '?' characters is designed to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown.
  - However, the logic for choosing the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` to replace '?' with 'F' or 'S' might not always guarantee that the requirement is met for all permutations of scenarios.

### Potential Issues:

- **Consecutive Videos**:
  - The program's approach of replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` might not always prevent more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
  - For example, if the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` are all in a contiguous block, it could lead to more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is not robust enough to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
