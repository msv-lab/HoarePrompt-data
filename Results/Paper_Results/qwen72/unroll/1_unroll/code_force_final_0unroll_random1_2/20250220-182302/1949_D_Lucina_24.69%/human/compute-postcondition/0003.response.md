Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, the input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each string represents a row in the transition video plan. Each character in the string is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and the number of 'F' and 'S' characters does not exceed 2 * floor(n / 2). `a` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0. `b` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.**
