The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 24) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a symmetric transition video plan matrix. Each character in the matrix can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The function processes this matrix to identify rows and columns with specific characteristics and then modifies the '?' characters in the matrix. Specifically, it counts the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column, and based on these counts, it creates two lists: `sa` for rows with at least one 'F' and no 'S' in the corresponding column, and `sb` for columns with at least one 'S' and no 'F' in the corresponding row. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the function replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sa` with 'F' and the rest with 'S'. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the function replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sb` with 'S' and the rest with 'F'. The function then prints the modified matrix. The original matrix `xx` remains unchanged, and the lists `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` retain their final states.
