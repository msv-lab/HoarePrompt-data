Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30), `queries` is a list of tuples (l, r) where each l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), `data` is a list of strings from the input, `idx` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `idx` is now explicitly set to 0.
