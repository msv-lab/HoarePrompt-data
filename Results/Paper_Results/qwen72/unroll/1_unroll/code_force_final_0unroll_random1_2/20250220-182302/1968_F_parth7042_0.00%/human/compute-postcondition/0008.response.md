The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` are integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30) representing the elements of the array. `queries` is a list of tuples (l, r) where each l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the query ranges. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes the given test cases and queries on the array `a` and returns the results of the queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. It processes `t` test cases, each with an array `a` of `n` elements and `q` queries. For each query (l, r), it returns the result of the query on the subarray `a[l-1:r]`.**
