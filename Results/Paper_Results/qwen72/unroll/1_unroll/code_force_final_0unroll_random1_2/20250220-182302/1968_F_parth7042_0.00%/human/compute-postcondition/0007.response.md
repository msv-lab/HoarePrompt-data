To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the structure of the `results` list.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, indicating the number of test cases.
- `n` and `q` are integers with constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `queries` is a list of tuples \((l, r)\) where each \(l\) and \(r\) are integers satisfying \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
- `data` is a list of strings from the input.
- `idx` is the index after processing all the data for `t` iterations.
- `results` is a list containing the results of the queries for each iteration, with an empty string at the end of each iteration.

### Analysis:
- The `results` list is constructed such that it contains the results of the queries for each test case, and an empty string is appended at the end of each test case.
- The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters, and then print this string.

### Example:
Let's assume the following values for the initial state:
- `t = 2` (two test cases)
- For the first test case:
  - `n = 5`
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `queries = [(1, 3), (2, 4)]`
  - Results for the first test case: `['sum of elements from index 1 to 2 is 5', 'sum of elements from index 2 to 3 is 9', '']`
- For the second test case:
  - `n = 3`
  - `a = [10, 20, 30]`
  - `queries = [(1, 2)]`
  - Results for the second test case: `['sum of elements from index 1 to 1 is 10', '']`

### Final `results` list:
```
results = [
    'sum of elements from index 1 to 2 is 5',
    'sum of elements from index 2 to 3 is 9',
    '',
    'sum of elements from index 1 to 1 is 10',
    ''
]
```

### Output:
The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print each element of the `results` list on a new line, including the empty strings.

Output: **sum of elements from index 1 to 2 is 5
sum of elements from index 2 to 3 is 9

sum of elements from index 1 to 1 is 10
**

### Explanation:
- The first two lines are the results of the queries for the first test case.
- The third line is an empty string, indicating the end of the first test case.
- The fourth line is the result of the query for the second test case.
- The fifth line is another empty string, indicating the end of the second test case.
