Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, `n` and `q` are integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively, `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30) representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples (l, r) where each l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the query ranges. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` and `q` are integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30), `queries` is a list of tuples (l, r) where each l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), `data` is a list of strings from the input, `idx` is the index after processing all the data for `t` iterations, `results` is a list containing the results of the queries for each iteration, with an empty string at the end of each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: sum of elements from index 1 to 2 is 5
    #sum of elements from index 2 to 3 is 9
    #
    #sum of elements from index 1 to 1 is 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data and processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes an array `a` of `n` elements and `q` queries. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` representing a subarray range. The function determines if the XOR of the elements in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, with an empty string separating the results of different test cases. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
