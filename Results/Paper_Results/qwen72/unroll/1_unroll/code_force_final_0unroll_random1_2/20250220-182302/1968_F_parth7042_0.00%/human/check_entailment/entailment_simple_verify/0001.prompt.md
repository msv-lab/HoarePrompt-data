You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient and appropriate for the problem's constraints.
   - The index `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - The number of test cases `t` is read and the program initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of all queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1` to handle 1-based indexing.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.
   - The program then reads the elements of the array `a` and calculates the prefix XOR values, storing them in `pf` and updating the dictionary `mp`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, the subarray is interesting because the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, which means it can be split into parts with XOR 0.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR dictionary `mp` where the prefix XOR values match `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` and if these indices can form a valid split.
   - Specifically, it uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the first index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the last index in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting; otherwise, it is not.

4. **Output:**
   - The results of all queries are appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all queries for a test case, an empty string is appended to `results` to separate the results of different test cases.
   - Finally, the program prints the results, joining them with newlines.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It efficiently calculates the prefix XOR values and uses a dictionary to store the indices of these values, allowing for quick lookups during query processing. The use of binary search ensures that the program can handle large inputs within the constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
