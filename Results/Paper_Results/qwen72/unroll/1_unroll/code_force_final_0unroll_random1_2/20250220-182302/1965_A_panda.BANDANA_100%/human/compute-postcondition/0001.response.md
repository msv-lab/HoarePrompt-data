To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer input by the user.
- The list of lists contains test cases, each with a length `n` and integers `a_i` satisfying the given constraints.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
