Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. `t` is now an integer input by the user. Each test case list should have a length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) and each integer `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.**
