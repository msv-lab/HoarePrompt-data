Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans of length `n`, initially all set to `False`, `coef` is a list of integers of length `n`, initially all set to `None`.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. This overrides the previous state where `r` was a list of integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
