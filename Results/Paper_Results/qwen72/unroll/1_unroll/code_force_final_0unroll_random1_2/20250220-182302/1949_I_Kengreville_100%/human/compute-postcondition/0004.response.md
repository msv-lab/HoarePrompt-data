Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n`, `coef` is a list of integers of length `n`, initially all set to `None`.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of `False` values of length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `visited` is a list of booleans of length `n`, all set to `False`, the state of `visited` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) are not affected by this code snippet.
