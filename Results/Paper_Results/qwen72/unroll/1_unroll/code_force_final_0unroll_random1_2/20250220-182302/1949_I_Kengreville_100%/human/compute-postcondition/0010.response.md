Output State: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

The initial state is preserved, and the only change is that the variable `ok` is now set to `False`.
