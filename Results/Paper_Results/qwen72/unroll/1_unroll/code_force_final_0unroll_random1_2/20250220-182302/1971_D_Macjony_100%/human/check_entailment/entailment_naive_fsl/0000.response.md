Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string contains multiple '1's followed by '0's correctly. For example, consider the input `111000`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange this string into a sorted binary string is 2 (cutting the string into "111" and "000"). However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program increments the count for every transition between '1' and '0', but it should only count the transitions that are necessary to achieve a sorted binary string.
