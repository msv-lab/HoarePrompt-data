Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a string s, where s is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description. The function should be defined to accept a string and possibly the number of test cases. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(s):
```

Or, if the function needs to handle multiple test cases:

```python
def func(t, s_list):
```

In this case, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and s_list is a list of strings where each string s is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
