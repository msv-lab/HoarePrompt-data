The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, representing the edges of the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the function. The function returns one of two strings based on the input parameters and the structure of the tree: 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' in one case and 'Hermione' in another case, based on the input parameters and the structure of the tree.**
