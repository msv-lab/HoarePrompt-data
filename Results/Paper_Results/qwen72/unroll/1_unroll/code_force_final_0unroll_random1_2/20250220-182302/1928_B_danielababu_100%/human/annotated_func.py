#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer value, and the user's input has been converted to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the space-separated list of integers input by the user into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a map object that converts each element of the list into an integer. The function does not modify any external state or variables and relies solely on the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the user can iterate over the returned map object to access the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each split part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list is derived from splitting a user-provided input string by spaces and converting each resulting substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function takes no arguments. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where the integers are obtained from the space-separated list of integers provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a sorted list of these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used; the function reads input from the standard input.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the input values split by whitespace, converted to strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split value to a string, and returns a map object containing these string values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function `func_6` does not take any parameters and is not directly related to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the user input and returns a list containing each character of the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is an element from the input provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings based on spaces, sorts the list, and returns the sorted list of strings. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a sorted list of strings derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and each integer in arr is greater than 0.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` remains a list of integers, each greater than 0; `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` up to that index; `tem` is the product of all the elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of integers 'ans', where each element in 'ans' is the product of all the elements in the list 'arr' up to that index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is greater than 0. It returns a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to that index. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
