You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a single integer result. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function performs a series of calculations and prints a value derived from these calculations. Otherwise, it prints `2 * k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function has no side effects on the input variables `n` and `k`, and all local variables are reset for the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd numbers, then the numbers that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - For each test case, we need to determine the k-th card laid down.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The program then checks if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. This is because the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd numbers from 1 to the largest odd number less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Case 1: \( k \leq (n + 1) // 2 \)**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the k-th card is simply the k-th odd number.
   - The k-th odd number can be calculated as `2 * k - 1`.
   - This part of the program is correct.

4. **Case 2: \( k > (n + 1) // 2 \)**
   - If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the k-th card is not among the first `(n + 1) // 2` odd numbers.
   - The program uses a loop to determine the number of times it needs to skip the odd-numbered cards and the cards that are multiples of 2, 4, 8, etc.
   - The variable `s` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `d` is the number of remaining cards.
   - The loop continues until `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0.
   - After the loop, `i` contains the number of times the loop has run, which corresponds to the power of 2 that we are considering (i.e., \(2^i\)).
   - The program then calculates the position `f` of the card within the current group of cards that are multiples of \(2^i\).
   - Finally, it calculates the k-th card as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to the number of odd cards.
   - For the case where `k` is greater than the number of odd cards, the program correctly skips the odd cards and the multiples of 2, 4, 8, etc., and calculates the correct position of the k-th card within the current group.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and `k = 1` correctly.
   - It also handles the maximum values for `n` and `k` (up to \(10^9\)) within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for laying down the cards in the specified order and determining the k-th card laid down. Therefore, the program is correct.
