The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
