You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: The loop executes for each test case, and for each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions provided. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are updated within the loop, but they are reinitialized for each test case. After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as they were initially, and the values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values for the next test case. The output for each test case will be a single integer, either `2 * k - 1` or `2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
