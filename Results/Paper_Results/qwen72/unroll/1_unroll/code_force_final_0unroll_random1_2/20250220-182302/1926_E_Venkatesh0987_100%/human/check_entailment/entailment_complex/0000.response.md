### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Condition Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the function directly prints `2 * k - 1`. This is correct because the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards in ascending order.

3. **Handling Larger `k` Values:**
   - If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function enters a more complex logic to determine the position of the card.
   - The variable `s` is used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `d` is initialized to `n` and is used to determine the number of cards that can be laid down in each step.
   - The variable `i` is used to count the number of steps taken.
   - The loop `while s < k and d > 0` calculates the number of cards laid down in each step until `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - The variable `h` is initialized to `n` and is used similarly to `d` to determine the number of cards that can be laid down in each step.
   - The variable `p` is used to count the number of steps taken, similar to `i`.
   - The loop `while p <= i - 1` calculates the cumulative number of cards laid down up to the step before the current one.
   - The variable `f` is calculated as `k - g`, where `g` is the cumulative number of cards laid down up to the step before the current one.
   - The final card position is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` and printed.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for handling `k` values greater than `(n + 1) // 2` is correct. It correctly calculates the position of the card by considering the number of steps and the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The calculation `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` ensures that the card laid down is the correct one based on the step and the position within that step.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where `k` is equal to `n` or `n` is a small number.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards, ensuring that it moves to the next step in the process.
