The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the piles of stones, and an integer `n` representing the number of piles, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
