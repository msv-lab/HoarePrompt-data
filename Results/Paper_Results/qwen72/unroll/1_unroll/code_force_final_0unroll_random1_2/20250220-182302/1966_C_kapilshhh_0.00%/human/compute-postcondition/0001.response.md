The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the piles of stones, and an integer `n` representing the number of piles, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `tc` must be greater than 0.**
