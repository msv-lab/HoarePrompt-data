#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from the standard input and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.

    #The program returns a map object that contains two integers, which are the result of converting the two space-separated integers read from the standard input (stdin).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line from the standard input (stdin), expecting it to contain two space-separated integers. It then converts these integers from strings to integers and returns a map object containing the two integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the two integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input stream, expecting the line to contain two space-separated integers. It then converts these integers from their string representation to actual integer values and returns them as a list. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list containing the two integers read from the input.

    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, where `rows_number` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

    #The program returns a string that is the result of reading a line from the standard input, removing trailing whitespace, and decoding it from bytes to a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes the input from bytes to a string, which it then returns.

def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers that were input by the user, where each integer is converted from a string to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and returns the minimum value of these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, it updates the `rank` list by setting `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus 1. After the function concludes, `d` remains unchanged, `processing` may have some elements set to 1, and `rank` will have `rank[da - 1]` updated.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers provided in the problem description.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. Here, `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the function `func_13(b, a % b)`. `y` is directly returned, the second value is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `y` from `x`, and `g` is also directly returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned these three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are positive integers, and k is an integer. The length of a is equal to n.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a is a list of integers, n and m are positive integers, and k is an integer. The length of a is equal to n. k is reduced by the total difference between m and each element in a that is less than m. k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The final state of the program is that `k` is modified based on the elements of `a` that are less than `m`, and the function returns either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `k`.
