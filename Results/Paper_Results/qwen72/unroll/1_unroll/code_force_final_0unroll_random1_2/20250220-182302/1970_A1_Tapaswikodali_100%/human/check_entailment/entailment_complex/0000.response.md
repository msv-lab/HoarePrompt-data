Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to perform a balanced shuffle on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then constructing a new string from the sorted characters.

2. **Class `BalanceInfo`**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is used to store the balance, position, and character of each prefix.
   - This class is correctly defined and used to hold the necessary information for each character in the string.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It first compares the balance values. If they are different, it returns the difference in balances.
   - If the balances are the same, it compares the positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
   - This function is correctly implemented and follows the problem's sorting criteria.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and performs the balanced shuffle operation.
   - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects for each character in the string.
   - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
   - After the loop, the `balance_info` list is sorted using the `func_1` comparison function.
   - The sorted list is then used to construct the result string, which is printed.

5. **Execution and Output**:
   - The program correctly computes the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting step ensures that the characters are ordered by their balance and, in case of ties, by their position in reverse order.
   - The final result is constructed by joining the characters in the sorted order, which should produce the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input constraints correctly (non-empty string, balanced parentheses, length not exceeding 500,000).
   - The balance is correctly maintained and reset to 0 at the end of the string, ensuring the input is balanced.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
