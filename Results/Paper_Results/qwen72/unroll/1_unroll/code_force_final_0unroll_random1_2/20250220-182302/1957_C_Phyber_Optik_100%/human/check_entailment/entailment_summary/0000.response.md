Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after k initial moves, where the computer mirrors the player's moves. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the number of valid moves in the remaining part of the game depends on the number of rows and columns that are still available after the initial k moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program starts by setting the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary because the dynamic programming function `func_1` is called with a large value of `n` (up to 300,000). This ensures that the recursion does not hit the default limit.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` values, indicating that the values have not been computed yet. The function `func_1` is then called to precompute the values of `dp` up to `n = 300,000`.

3. **Base Cases for `func_1`**:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board without any rooks attacking each other.

4. **Recurrence Relation in `func_1`**:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`: This recurrence relation is derived from the problem of placing rooks on an i x i board. The term `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where the i-th row and column are not used. The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the configurations where the i-th row or column is used, and the rook can be placed in any of the `i - 1` positions in the other dimension, with the remaining board being an (i-2) x (i-2) board.

5. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the k moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The number of remaining rows and columns available for placing rooks is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program prints the precomputed value `dp[n - len(invalid)]` modulo 1000000007, which represents the number of different final configurations possible.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n - len(invalid)` is 0, the program correctly prints `1` because there are no valid moves left, and the only configuration is the one with the initial moves.
   - If `n - len(invalid)` is 1, the program correctly prints `1` because there is only one way to place a rook on the remaining 1x1 board.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly compute the number of different final configurations using dynamic programming and the provided recurrence relation. The use of the `invalid` set to track occupied rows and columns is appropriate, and the final output is computed correctly based on the precomputed `dp` values.

Correctness: **True**
