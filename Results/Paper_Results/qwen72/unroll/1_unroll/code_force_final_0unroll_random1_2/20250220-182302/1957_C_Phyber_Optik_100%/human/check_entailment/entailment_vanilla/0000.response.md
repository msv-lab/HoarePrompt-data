### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) chessboard where we place white rooks and the computer places black rooks in mirrored positions.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after placing all possible valid rooks, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - A valid move is placing a rook such that it does not attack any other rook (i.e., no two rooks share the same row or column).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to precompute the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns) using dynamic programming.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a single rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board:
       - (1,1) and (2,2)
       - (1,2) and (2,1)
       - (1,1) and (2,2) with one rook of each color.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
     - This relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, reducing the problem to an \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board.
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board, considering the two possible mirrored positions.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then reads \( k \) moves.
   - It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns after accounting for the \( k \) moves.
   - The number of remaining rows and columns is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - It prints the result using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n - \text{len(invalid)} = 0 \) by printing `1` (since there are no moves left, the configuration is unique).
   - The dynamic programming table `dp` is precomputed up to \( 300000 \) to handle the maximum possible \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the input and output as described. The logic for calculating the number of valid configurations and the edge cases are sound.
