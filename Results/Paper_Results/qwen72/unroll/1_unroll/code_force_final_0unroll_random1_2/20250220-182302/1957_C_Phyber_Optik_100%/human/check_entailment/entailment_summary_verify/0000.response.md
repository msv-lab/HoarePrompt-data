### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of available rows/columns.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly set. For a 1x1 board, there is only 1 way to place a rook (either white or black, but not both). For a 2x2 board, there are 3 ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other:
     - One white rook at (1, 1) and one black rook at (2, 2).
     - One white rook at (1, 2) and one black rook at (2, 1).
     - No rooks on the board.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is correct because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where no rook is placed in the i-th row/column.
     - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the configurations where a rook is placed in the i-th row and a rook is placed in the i-th column, but not both in the same position. This is because for each of the `i - 1` positions in the i-th row, there are `i - 1` positions in the i-th column that are not the same, and each of these configurations can be mirrored in two ways (white in row, black in column or vice versa).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns to the `invalid` set to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is correct because it ensures that the positions where rooks are already placed are not considered for further placement.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of available rows/columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the result from the `dp` array for the number of available rows/columns, ensuring the result is at least 1 (since there is always at least one configuration). This is correct because even if all rows and columns are occupied, there is still one configuration where no rooks are placed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `r = c` and the computer skips its turn. This is because the `invalid` set will not add the same row and column twice, and the dynamic programming calculation will still work correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the board size `n` is 1, as the `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
