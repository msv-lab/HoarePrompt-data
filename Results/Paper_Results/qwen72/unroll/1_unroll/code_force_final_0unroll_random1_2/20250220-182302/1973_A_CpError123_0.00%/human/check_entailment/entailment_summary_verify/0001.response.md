### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases. The variable `t` is the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples representing the scores for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `t` and `cas_de_test` as arguments, and the results are printed in the required format.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. This is correct because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) always adds an even number of points to the total score.
   - If the total points are odd, the program appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

3. **Total Matches Check:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This is correct because each match (regardless of the result) adds 2 points to the total score.
   - The program then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This check is indeed incorrect. The number of matches should not be limited to 3, as the problem does not specify this constraint. Additionally, `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` if all games ended in draws.

4. **Draws Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest and the other two players can be attributed to wins and losses, and the remaining points can be attributed to draws.
   - The program then checks if `egalites` is negative. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
   - If `egalites` is non-negative, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is the number of draws.

5. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - For the test case `(0, 0, 0)`, the program correctly returns `0` because no games were played.
   - For the test case `(0, 1, 1)`, the program correctly returns `1` because one game ended in a draw.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 1)`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because it should be possible for all three players to have 1 point each if there was one draw and two losses.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 2)`, the program correctly returns `2` because two games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `(3, 3, 3)`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because it should be possible for all three players to have 3 points each if there were three draws.
   - For the test case `(3, 4, 5)`, the program correctly returns `6` because six games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 10)`, the program correctly returns `2` because two games could have ended in draws.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the `total_matchs` check. The program is indeed incorrect due to the overly restrictive condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to remove the restrictive condition and handle cases like `(1, 1, 1)` and `(3, 3, 3)` correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

This corrected version should handle all test cases correctly.
