The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). It processes each tuple to determine the number of draws based on specific conditions and returns a list `resultats` where each element is either -1 (indicating an invalid condition) or the calculated number of draws. The final state of the program includes the original `t` and `cas_de_test` unchanged, and `resultats` containing the results of the draw calculations for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.
