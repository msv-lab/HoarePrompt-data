Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list of integers, where each integer is either -1 or the number of draws calculated based on the conditions in the loop.**
