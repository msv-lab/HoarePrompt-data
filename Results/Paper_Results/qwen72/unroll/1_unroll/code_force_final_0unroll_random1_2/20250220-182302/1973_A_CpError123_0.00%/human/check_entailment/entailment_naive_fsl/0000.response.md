Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The total number of matches can be greater than 3, and the maximum score `p3` can be greater than the total number of matches. This condition incorrectly filters out valid cases.

For example, consider the input `(0, 0, 6)`. The total points are 6, which is even, and the total number of matches is 3. However, the program incorrectly returns -1 because `p3 > total_matchs` is `True` (6 > 3). According to the problem description, this should be a valid case where the maximum number of draws is 3 (since all games could have ended in a draw).

Thus, the program is incorrect for this input.
