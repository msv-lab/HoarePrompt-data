Output State: `n` remains the same integer value input by the user, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the connected nodes. Each pair of integers `(u, v)` input during the loop execution has been used to append `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`, with `u` and `v` being 0-indexed. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the number of connections (edges) that the corresponding node has.
