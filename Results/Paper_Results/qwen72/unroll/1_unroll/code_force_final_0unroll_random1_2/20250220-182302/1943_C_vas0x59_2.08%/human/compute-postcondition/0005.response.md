Output State: **`n` remains the same integer value input by the user, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the connected nodes. Each pair of integers `(u, v)` input during the loop execution has been used to append `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`, with `u` and `v` being 0-indexed. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the number of connections (edges) that the corresponding node has. `d` is a dictionary containing the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, and `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value (likely a secondary output from the `bfs` function, such as the parent nodes in the BFS tree), but its specific value is not relevant to the output state.**
