You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement, which is `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each test case, and `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals (2n-1 main diagonals and 2n-1 anti-diagonals).

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If so, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
     - If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals, then every diagonal must have at least one colored cell.
     - To achieve this, we need to color the cells in such a way that each diagonal is covered. The optimal way to do this is to color the cells along the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, which requires \( n \) cells.
     - However, the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). For \( k = 4n - 2 \), \( k // 2 = 2n - 1 \), and adding 1 gives \( 2n \), which is incorrect. The correct number of cells to color should be \( n \).

   - **Case 2: \( k < 4n - 2 \)**:
     - If \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
     - The optimal way to do this is to color cells in a pattern that covers the required diagonals. Each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - Therefore, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \), which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect for the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \). It should print \( n \) instead of \( k // 2 + 1 \).

Correctness: **False**
