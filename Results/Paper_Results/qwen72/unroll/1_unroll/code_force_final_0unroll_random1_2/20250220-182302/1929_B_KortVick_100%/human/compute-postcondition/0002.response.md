Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.**
