Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2); `t` is an input integer.**
