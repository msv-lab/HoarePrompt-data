Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through each test case, counts the frequency of each difficulty level in the given string, and calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level required to hold `m` rounds. The program then sums these missing problems and appends the result to the `results` list, which is printed at the end. The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.
