The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m` for each test case in the list `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer indicates the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the string `a` to make each character appear at least `m` times.**
