You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, a = test_cases[_]
        
        freq = [0] * 7
        
        for prob in a:

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m` for each test case in the list `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer indicates the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the string `a` to make each character appear at least `m` times.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m` for each test case in the list `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
