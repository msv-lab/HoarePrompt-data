Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s`, then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and prints the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `s` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and are not retained after the loop completes.**
