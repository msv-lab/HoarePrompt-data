You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s`, then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and prints the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `s` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and are not retained after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them, but it does not account for the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":

- The program will count "map" once and "pie" once, and output 2.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we can delete the 4th and 9th characters ('n' and 'e'), resulting in "mmapapi", which is beautiful. This requires only 2 deletions, but the program does not consider this.

Another example is the string "mappppie":

- The program will count "map" once and "pie" once, and output 2.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we can delete the 4th and 8th characters ('p' and 'p'), resulting in "mappie", which is still ugly. The correct answer should be 2 deletions to remove "map" and "pie" completely, but the program does not handle this correctly.

The program needs to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" substrings, not just count their occurrences.
