Reasoning:  

The provided program is **incorrect** for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but it should take the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. However, this is a minor issue because the function is reading the inputs directly from `input()`.

2. **Substring Counting**: The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" using the `count` method. This method counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings. For example, in the string "mappppie", the `count` method will count "map" once and "pie" once, but it does not account for the fact that removing a single character can make the string beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the result. This is incorrect because the problem requires the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful, not the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing the 4th and 9th characters (resulting in "mmapnape") would make the string beautiful, but the program would output 2, which is the number of "map" and "pie" substrings, not the minimum deletions required.

4. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappppie", the correct answer should be 2 (remove the 'p' between "map" and "pie"), but the program would output 2, which is incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap or where they are part of a larger pattern that requires fewer deletions to make the string beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
