Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums these counts, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string beautiful. The program should instead find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the string.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Identify all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
2. Calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings. This involves more than just counting the occurrences; it requires a strategy to remove the minimum number of characters to break these substrings.

The current implementation simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the result, which is incorrect. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie" and output 2, but the correct answer is 2 because removing the 4th and 9th characters makes the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
