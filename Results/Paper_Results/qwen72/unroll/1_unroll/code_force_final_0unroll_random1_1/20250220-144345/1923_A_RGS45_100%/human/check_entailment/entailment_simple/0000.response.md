### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon state as a list of integers `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip in the ribbon.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip in the ribbon, but this is done on the reversed string, so it actually finds the distance from the end of the ribbon to the last chip.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - The function then extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This substring `z` should contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The function prints the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The approach of finding the first and last chip and counting the free cells between them is correct for determining the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
   - However, the way the substring is extracted might be incorrect. The correct way to extract the substring from the first chip to the last chip should be `arr[x:n - y]` or `arr[x:n - y + 1]` depending on how the indices are handled. The current implementation might miss the last chip if `y` is not adjusted properly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where all chips are already in a single block (e.g., the third test case).
   - It also handles the case where there is only one chip (e.g., the second test case).

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the distance from the end to the last chip. This works, but it might be more intuitive to use `arr.rfind('1')` to find the index of the last chip directly.
   - The substring extraction `arr[x:n - y]` might be off by one. It should be `arr[x:n - y + 1]` to include the last chip.

### Correctness:
Given the potential issue with the substring extraction, the program is not entirely correct. The correct implementation should ensure that the substring includes the last chip.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr.rfind('1')
        
        z = arr[x:y + 1]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
```

This corrected version uses `arr.rfind('1')` to find the index of the last chip directly and ensures the substring `z` includes the last chip by using `arr[x:y + 1]`.
