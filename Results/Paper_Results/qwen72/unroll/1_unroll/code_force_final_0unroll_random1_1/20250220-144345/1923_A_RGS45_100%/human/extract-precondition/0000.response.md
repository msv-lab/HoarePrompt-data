Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case with the first element being an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and the second element being a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon. Each test case must contain at least one chip (a_i = 1).**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def min_operations(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the ribbon cells.
