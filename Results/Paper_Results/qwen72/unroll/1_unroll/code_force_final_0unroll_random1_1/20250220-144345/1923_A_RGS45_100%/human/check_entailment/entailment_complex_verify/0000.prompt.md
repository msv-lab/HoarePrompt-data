You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case with the first element being an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and the second element being a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon. Each test case must contain at least one chip (a_i = 1).
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The function will print the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the final values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1'). The function finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string and prints the number of '0's between these two occurrences. If a test case does not contain a '1', the function will print 0. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated and used during the execution of the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips and the optimal solution involves moving chips from the right block to the left block. For example, consider the input:

```
1
8
1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
```

The expected output is `2` because the optimal solution is to move the chip from the 6th cell to the 4th cell, and then move the chip from the 7th cell to the 5th cell. However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations.
