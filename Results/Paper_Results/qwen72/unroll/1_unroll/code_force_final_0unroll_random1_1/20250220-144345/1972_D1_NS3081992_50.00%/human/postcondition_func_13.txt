The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 if the sum of the differences `(m - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)` where `a[i] < m` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`, the integer `n`, or the integer `m`. The final state of `k` is decreased by the sum of these differences.
