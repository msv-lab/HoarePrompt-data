The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function might internally use or depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^5, which likely represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 26, possibly representing a number related to the alphabet.
- `k` is an integer where 1 <= k <= 26, which could represent the number of distinct lowercase English alphabets used.
- `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 1000, likely representing the length of a string.
- `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but it is expected to produce some result based on these parameters, possibly related to the string `s` and the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` of length `m` that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and it is expected to handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^5`, `1 <= n <= 26`, `1 <= k <= 26`, and `1 <= m <= 1000`. The exact output is not specified, but it is likely related to the composition or manipulation of the string `s` based on the given constraints.**
