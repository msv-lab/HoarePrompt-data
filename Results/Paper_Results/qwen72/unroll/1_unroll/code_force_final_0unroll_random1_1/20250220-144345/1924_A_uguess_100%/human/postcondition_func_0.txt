The function `func` processes up to `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `m`. The string `s` consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` complete sets of all `k` distinct characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a modified string `ans` that includes the first missing character to complete a set, followed by 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `cnt` is the number of complete sets found in `s`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
