Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^5, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer where 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, either 'YES' has been printed if the required number of complete sets of k characters was found in the string s, or 'NO' followed by a modified string ans has been printed if the required number of sets was not found. The modified string ans contains the first character that was missing to complete the set, followed by 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times, where cnt is the number of complete sets found in s.**
