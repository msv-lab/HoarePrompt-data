The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since `t` is given as an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^5, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0**
