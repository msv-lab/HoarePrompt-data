You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads new values for A, B, and C from the input, processes them according to the given conditions, and prints the result. After all iterations, the loop completes, and the values of t, n, a, and b are still within their initial ranges.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotion price to find the minimum cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - The program then checks if the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is greater than or equal to twice the regular price (`B * 2`):
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts is `A * B`.
     - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means `A` is even. In this case, the minimum cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means `A` is odd. In this case, we can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. The cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The first condition `if B * 2 < C` correctly handles the case where the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price.
   - The second condition `elif A % 2 == 0` correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is even, and we can buy all pairs at the promotion price.
   - The third condition `else` correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd. It buys `A // 2` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `A` is 1 or 2.
   - For `A = 1`, the program will print `B` because it cannot use the promotion.
   - For `A = 2`, the program will print `C` if `C` is cheaper than `2 * B`, otherwise it will print `2 * B`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given example:
     - For `2 5 9`, it prints `9` because `9` is cheaper than `10` (2 * 5).
     - For `3 5 9`, it prints `14` because `14` (9 + 5) is cheaper than `15` (3 * 5).
     - For `3 5 11`, it prints `15` because `15` (3 * 5) is cheaper than `16` (11 + 5).
     - For `4 5 11`, it prints `20` because `20` (4 * 5) is cheaper than `22` (2 * 11).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.
