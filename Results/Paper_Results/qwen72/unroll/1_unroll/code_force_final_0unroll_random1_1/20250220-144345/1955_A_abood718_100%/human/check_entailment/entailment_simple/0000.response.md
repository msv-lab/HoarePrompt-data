### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - **First Condition:** `if B * 2 < C:`
     - This checks if the regular price for two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price for two yogurts (`C`). If true, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - **Second Condition:** `elif A % 2 == 0:`
     - This checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it means all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotional price, so the total cost is `A * C / 2`.
   - **Third Condition:** `else:`
     - This handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X = A // 2` and buys them at the promotional price, then buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price. The total cost is `X * C + B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `A` is even or odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the regular price for two yogurts is less than the promotional price.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For `A = 2, B = 5, C = 9`, the output is `9` because `B * 2` (10) is not less than `C` (9), and `A` is even, so the cost is `A * C / 2` (9).
   - For `A = 3, B = 5, C = 9`, the output is `14` because `B * 2` (10) is not less than `C` (9), and `A` is odd, so the cost is `X * C + B` (1 * 9 + 5 = 14).
   - For `A = 3, B = 5, C = 11`, the output is `15` because `B * 2` (10) is less than `C` (11), so the cost is `A * B` (3 * 5 = 15).
   - For `A = 4, B = 5, C = 11`, the output is `20` because `B * 2` (10) is less than `C` (11), so the cost is `A * B` (4 * 5 = 20).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `A` yogurts based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
