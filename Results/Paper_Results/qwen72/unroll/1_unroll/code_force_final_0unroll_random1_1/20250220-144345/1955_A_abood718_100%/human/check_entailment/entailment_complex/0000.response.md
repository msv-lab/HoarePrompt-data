Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if the regular price of two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`). If this is true, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the function prints `A * B` (the total cost of buying `A` yogurts individually).
   - The second condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If `A` is even, the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - The third condition handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X` as `A // 2` and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `X * C + B`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is sound:
     - If `B * 2 < C`, buying individually is cheaper.
     - If `A` is even, buying in pairs is cheaper.
     - If `A` is odd, buying as many pairs as possible and then one additional yogurt individually is the optimal strategy.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `A` is 1 correctly (it will fall into the `else` block and print `B`).
   - The function also handles the edge case where `A` is 2 correctly (it will fall into the `elif` block and print `C` if `B * 2 >= C`).

5. **Correctness of the Example**:
   - For the input `2 5 9`, the function correctly prints `9` because `B * 2 < C` is false, and `A` is even, so it prints `A * C / 2 = 9`.
   - For the input `3 5 9`, the function correctly prints `14` because `B * 2 < C` is false, and `A` is odd, so it prints `X * C + B = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the input `3 5 11`, the function correctly prints `15` because `B * 2 < C` is true, so it prints `A * B = 3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the input `4 5 11`, the function correctly prints `20` because `B * 2 < C` is true, so it prints `A * B = 4 * 5 = 20`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
