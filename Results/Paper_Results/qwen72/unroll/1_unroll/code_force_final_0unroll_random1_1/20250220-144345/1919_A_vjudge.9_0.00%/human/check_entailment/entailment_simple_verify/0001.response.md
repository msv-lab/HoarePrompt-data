### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making a decision, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Parity Rule:**
   - If `(a + b)` is even, the game will end in an even number of turns. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be unable to make a move after Bob's turn.
   - If `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end in an odd number of turns. Since Alice starts, Alice will make the last move, and Bob will be unable to make a move after Alice's turn.

4. **Function 1:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `(a + b)`.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the optimal play analysis.

5. **Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - This function correctly processes the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
  - `results` is an empty list.

- **Loop Through Test Cases:**
  - For each test case, `a` and `b` are read as integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`.
  - `func_1(a, b)` is called, which returns 'Bob' if `(a + b)` is even and 'Alice' if `(a + b)` is odd.
  - The result is appended to the `results` list.

- **Final State:**
  - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case.
  - Each element of `results` is printed to the console in the order they appear in the list.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
