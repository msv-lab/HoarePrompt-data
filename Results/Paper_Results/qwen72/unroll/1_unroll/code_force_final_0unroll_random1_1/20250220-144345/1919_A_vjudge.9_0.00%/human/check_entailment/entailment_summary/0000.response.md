### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game is played with two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet. They can choose to swap wallets or keep their current one before removing a coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet is empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a parity problem. The key insight is that the game will always end in a finite number of moves, and the parity of the total number of coins (sum of `a` and `b`) determines the winner.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the user.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and stores the result in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list `results`.

4. **Parity Logic Explanation:**
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, the game will end with both wallets being empty at the same time, and Bob will have the last move because Alice starts first.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end with one wallet having one more coin than the other, and Alice will have the last move because she starts first.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the test case `1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), so `func_1` returns 'Bob', which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `1 4`, the sum is `5` (odd), so `func_1` returns 'Alice', which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `5 3`, the sum is `8` (even), so `func_1` returns 'Bob', which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `4 5`, the sum is `9` (odd), so `func_1` returns 'Alice', which matches the expected output.
   - The other test cases can be similarly verified.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the total number of coins. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
