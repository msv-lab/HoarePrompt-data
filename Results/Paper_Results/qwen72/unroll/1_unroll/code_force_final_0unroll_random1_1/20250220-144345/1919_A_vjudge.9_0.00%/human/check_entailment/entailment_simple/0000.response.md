Reasoning:

The game described involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns performing two actions: deciding whether to swap wallets and then removing one coin from their wallet. The player who cannot perform a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses. The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins in both wallets combined.

### Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Initial Condition**: Both wallets have at least one coin, and the number of coins in each wallet is between 1 and \(10^9\).
2. **Turns**: Alice starts first, and each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, followed by removing one coin.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot remove a coin from their wallet loses.

### Key Insight:
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, the game will always end with both wallets having 0 coins at the same time. Since Alice starts first, she will always make the first move, and Bob will make the last move. Therefore, Bob will win.
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, the game will end with one wallet having 1 coin and the other having 0 coins. Since Alice starts first, she will be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with an empty wallet. Therefore, Alice will win.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
  - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
  - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
  - This logic is correct based on the reasoning above.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function handles multiple test cases.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
  - This function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The input and output handling is also correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
