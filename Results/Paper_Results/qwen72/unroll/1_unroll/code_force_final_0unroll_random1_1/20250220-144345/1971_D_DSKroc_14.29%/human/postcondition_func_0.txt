The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` read from the input, the function prints the number of positions where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', plus one. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` retains the value of the last binary string processed.
