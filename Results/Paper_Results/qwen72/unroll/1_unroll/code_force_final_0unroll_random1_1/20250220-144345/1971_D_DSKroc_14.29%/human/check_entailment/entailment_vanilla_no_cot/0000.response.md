Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the binary string `s`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character is greater than the next character (`int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`). This condition is true only when the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'.
   - If this condition is met, it increments the `count` by 1. This is because each such transition indicates a point where the string needs to be cut to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1` because the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of pieces needed for each test case.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string, and the output is consistent with the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
