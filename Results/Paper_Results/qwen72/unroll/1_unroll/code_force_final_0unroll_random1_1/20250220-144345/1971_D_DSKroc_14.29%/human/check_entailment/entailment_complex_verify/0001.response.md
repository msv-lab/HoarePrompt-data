### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a given binary string can be divided into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is greater than the next character `s[i + 1]`. Since `s` is a binary string, `s[i]` can only be '0' or '1', and `s[i + 1]` can only be '0' or '1'. The condition `int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])` will be true only if `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '0'.
   - If the condition is true, it increments the counter `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the observation that a sorted binary string should not have a '1' followed by a '0'. Each time we encounter a '1' followed by a '0', it indicates a point where we need to make a cut to separate the '1's and '0's.
   - The number of cuts needed is equal to the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'.
   - Adding 1 to the count of cuts gives the number of pieces, because each cut creates one additional piece.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the program will correctly output 1.
   - If the string consists of only '0's or only '1's, the program will correctly output 1.
   - If the string is not sorted, the program will correctly count the number of '1' followed by '0' and output the correct number of pieces.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program iterates through the string once, making it O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is efficient and within the constraints provided.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. This is correct because the function reads the inputs directly from `input()`.
- **State of the program after the function call**: The loop will print the number of positions in each binary string `s` where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', plus one, for each of the `t` iterations. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `s` will retain the value of the last input string provided. This is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct. The program correctly identifies the number of cuts needed to divide the binary string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
- The logic and implementation are sound, and the edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Final: **True**
