Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The logic of the program is to count the number of times a '1' appears before a '0' in the string, which effectively determines the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The program handles all edge cases, including strings that are already sorted, strings with only one character, and strings with multiple '1's and '0's in various orders. The addition of 1 to the count at the end accounts for the fact that the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
