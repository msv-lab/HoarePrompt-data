You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the values of `n` and `m` are processed according to the conditions in the loop, printing 'Yes' or 'No' based on the given rules. The final state of `n` and `m` is undefined as they are reassigned in each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If \( n \) is the number of moves, the number of cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves can range from \( 0 \) to \( n \) (if all moves are adding cubes).
   - The number of cubes in the tower can also be any odd or even number within this range, depending on the sequence of adding and removing cubes.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - **\( n = m \):** If the number of moves \( n \) is equal to the number of cubes \( m \), Nikita can simply add \( n \) cubes in \( n \) moves. This is always possible.
   - **\( m > n \):** If the number of cubes \( m \) is greater than the number of moves \( n \), it is impossible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - **\( m = n - 1 \):** If the number of cubes \( m \) is exactly one less than the number of moves \( n \), Nikita can add \( n - 1 \) cubes and then remove one cube. This is always possible.
   - **\( m \) and \( n \) both even or both odd:** If both \( m \) and \( n \) are even or both are odd, it is possible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes in the tower will match the parity of the number of moves.
   - **Otherwise:** If \( m \) and \( n \) have different parities, it is impossible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If \( n = m \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m > n \), it prints "No".
     - If \( m = n - 1 \), it prints "Yes".
     - If both \( m \) and \( n \) are even, it prints "Yes".
     - If both \( m \) and \( n \) are odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Verification:**
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios:
     - \( n = m \) is correctly handled.
     - \( m > n \) is correctly handled.
     - \( m = n - 1 \) is correctly handled.
     - Parity checks for both even and odd cases are correctly handled.
   - The program does not miss any edge cases or logical errors.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles all the conditions as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
