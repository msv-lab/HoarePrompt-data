### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **Condition 1:** `if n == m:`
     - If `n` is equal to `m`, it means Nikita can put exactly `m` cubes on the tower in `m` moves. This is correct.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif m > n:`
     - If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have a tower of `m` cubes after only `n` moves. This is correct.
   - **Condition 3:** `elif m == n - 1:`
     - If `m` is exactly one less than `n`, it means Nikita can put `m` cubes and then remove one cube, ending up with `m` cubes. This is correct.
   - **Condition 4:** `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`
     - If both `m` and `n` are even, it means Nikita can put and remove cubes in such a way that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes remains consistent. This is correct.
   - **Condition 5:** `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`
     - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it means Nikita can put and remove cubes in such a way that the parity of the number of cubes remains consistent. This is correct.
   - **Else:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means the parity of `m` and `n` is different, making it impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is correct.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and produces the correct output for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
