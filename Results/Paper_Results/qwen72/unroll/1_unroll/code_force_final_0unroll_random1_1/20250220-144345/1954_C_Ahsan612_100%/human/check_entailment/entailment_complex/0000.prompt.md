Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will output two lines. The first line will contain the maximum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will contain the minimum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where both integers are composed of digits from 1 to 9 and are less than 10^100. It then constructs two new integers: the first integer is formed by taking the maximum digit at each position from `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second integer is formed by taking the minimum digit at each position from `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The function prints these two integers for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is read from the input at the beginning and remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return any value.
