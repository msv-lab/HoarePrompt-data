The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `x` and `y` are also not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
