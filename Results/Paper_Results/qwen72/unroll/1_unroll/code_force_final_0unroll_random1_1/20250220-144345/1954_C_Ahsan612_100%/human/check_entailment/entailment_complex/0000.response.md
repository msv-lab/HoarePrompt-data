### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and converts them into lists of digits.

2. **Digit Comparison and Swapping:**
   - The function initializes two lists `new` and `new2` to store the resulting digits for the new values of `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through the digits of `x` and `y`:
     - If the digits at the current position are the same, it assigns the maximum of the two digits to `new` and the minimum to `new2`.
     - If the digits differ, it assigns the maximum of the two digits to `new` and the minimum to `new2` for the current position and all subsequent positions.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the resulting integers by joining the lists `new` and `new2` into strings and converting them back to integers.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits at the same positions.
   - The function's approach is to swap digits such that the maximum digit is placed in `new` and the minimum digit is placed in `new2` up to the point where the digits differ. After that point, it continues to place the minimum digit in `new` and the maximum digit in `new2`.
   - This approach ensures that the resulting `new` and `new2` are as large and as small as possible, respectively, which should maximize the product of the two numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `x` and `y` are identical by simply printing the same number twice.
   - The function also handles the case where `x` and `y` are of different lengths by processing only up to the length of the shorter number, which is not a concern here since the problem guarantees that `x` and `y` are of the same length.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The function correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits.
   - The output format matches the problem description, and the function processes each test case as expected.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The function correctly solves the problem by maximizing the product of `x` and `y` through the described digit swapping operations and prints the results in the required format.
