Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where both integers are composed of digits from 1 to 9 and are less than 10^100. It then constructs two new integers: the first integer is formed by taking the maximum digit at each position from `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second integer is formed by taking the minimum digit at each position from `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The function prints these two integers for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is read from the input at the beginning and remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return any value. **
