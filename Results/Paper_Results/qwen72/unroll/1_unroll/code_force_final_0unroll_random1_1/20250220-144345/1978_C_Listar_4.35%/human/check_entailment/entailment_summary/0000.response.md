### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs initial checks.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`. This is correct because the maximum value is achieved when the permutation is reversed, and the sum of the absolute differences is maximized.
   - If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for generating a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, attempting to rearrange elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic involves moving the last element to a position that reduces `k` by the appropriate amount. This is done by checking if `1 + i > k` and adjusting the list accordingly.
   - If `k` is reduced to 0, the function returns the modified list `l`.
   - The function ensures that the permutation is valid and the Manhattan value is exactly `k`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints the result if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.
   - It does not modify the list and simply outputs the result.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function ties everything together.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The initial checks in `func_2` ensure that `k` is even and within the valid range for the given `n`.
- The permutation generation in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by rearranging elements in a controlled manner.
- The output in `func_3` is correctly formatted to match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly handles the constraints and generates the required permutations.
