### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function checks if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - It correctly checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - **Conclusion:** The logic in `func_2` is correct and ensures that the input is valid and within the possible range for a permutation.

3. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, and for each element, it checks if it can be moved to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` is zero, it returns the list as is.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - **Key Points:**
     - The division `k = k // 2` is used to reduce the problem to a simpler form where the maximum possible Manhattan value is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
     - The loop iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, which is a valid approach to construct the permutation.
     - The condition `1 + i > k` is used to determine if the current element can be moved to achieve the desired Manhattan value. This condition is correct because it ensures that the remaining `k` value can be achieved by moving the current element.
     - The moves are made to either the position `-k` or the beginning of the list, which are valid operations to construct the permutation.
   - **Conclusion:** The logic in `func_1` is correct and should generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.

4. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation.
   - **Conclusion:** The function correctly prints the permutation if a valid one is found.

5. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function is the main function that handles the input and output.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the permutation.
   - **Conclusion:** The function correctly handles the input and output, calling the appropriate functions to check for a valid permutation and generate it if possible.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The logic in `func_1` is robust and should correctly generate a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
- The program as a whole is correctly structured and should handle all valid inputs and produce the correct output.

Final: **True**
