### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**: Reads `n` and `k` from the input.
- **Output**: Returns `(n, k)` if `k` is even and within the allowed range, otherwise returns `(0, 0)`.

**Annotations and Analysis**:
1. **Check if `k` is odd**:
   - If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`.
   - This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even (since each term `|p_i - i|` is an integer, and the sum of absolute differences of integers is always even).

2. **Calculate `max_k`**:
   - If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - If `n` is even, `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - This is correct because the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed `n^2 // 2` for even `n` and `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n`.

3. **Check if `k` exceeds `max_k`**:
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`.
   - This is correct because no permutation can have a Manhattan value greater than `max_k`.

4. **Return `n` and `k`**:
   - If `k` is even and within the allowed range, the function returns `(n, k)`.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

**Conclusion for `func_2`**:
- The function correctly handles the cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value.
- It returns `(0, 0)` in these cases, which is used by `func_4` to print "No".

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
- **Input**: Two integers `n` and `k`.
- **Output**: A permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`, or the original list if `k` is 0.

**Annotations and Analysis**:
1. **Initialize `k` and list `l`**:
   - `k` is divided by 2.
   - `l` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - This is correct because the Manhattan value is always even, and dividing `k` by 2 simplifies the problem.

2. **Rearrange elements in `l`**:
   - The function iterates from `n-1` to `0`.
   - If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l`.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to position `-k` and returns the list.
   - Otherwise, it reduces `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element to the front, and continues the loop.
   - This logic is intended to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value, but it may not always produce a valid permutation.

**Example Analysis**:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 5`:
  - `func_2` correctly returns `(0, 0)` because `k` is odd.
  - `func_4` correctly prints "No" based on the return value of `func_2`.

- For `n = 4` and `k = 6`:
  - `func_2` returns `(4, 6)` because `k` is even and within the allowed range.
  - `func_1` is called with `n = 4` and `k = 3` (since `k` is divided by 2).
  - The function should generate a permutation with a Manhattan value of 6, but the current implementation may not always do so correctly.

**Conclusion for `func_1`**:
- The function does not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
- For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 6`, the function may not return a valid permutation.

#### Function 4: `func_4()`
- **Input**: None.
- **Output**: Prints "Yes" followed by a permutation if a valid permutation exists, otherwise prints "No".

**Annotations and Analysis**:
1. **Call `func_2`**:
   - Retrieves `n` and `k` from `func_2`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Check if `n` is 0**:
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "No" and returns.
   - This is correct because `func_2` returns `(0, 0)` when no valid permutation exists.

3. **Call `func_1`**:
   - If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Print the permutation**:
   - Calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`.
   - This is correct.

**Conclusion for `func_4`**:
- The function correctly handles the cases where no valid permutation exists.
- However, it relies on `func_1` to generate a valid permutation, which may not always be correct.

### Final Evaluation
- **Original Assessment**: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in `func_1` where it may not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
- **Verification**:
  - `func_2` is correct in its logic and handling of invalid cases.
  - `func_1` is incorrect in its logic for generating permutations with the desired Manhattan value.
  - `func_4` correctly uses the results of `func_2` and `func_1`.

**Final**: **False**

The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value, leading to potential incorrect outputs for valid inputs.
