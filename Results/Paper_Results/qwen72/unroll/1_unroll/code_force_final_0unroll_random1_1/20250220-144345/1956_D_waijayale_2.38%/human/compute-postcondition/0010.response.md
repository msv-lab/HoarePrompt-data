The provided code snippet calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. Since the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined in the snippet, we can only infer the impact based on the given initial state and the typical behavior of such a function. Typically, a function like this might modify the sum `s` or other variables related to the sublist `a[l:pos]`.

However, without the definition of `recursive_maximize_sum`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. Therefore, we will assume that the function does not return any value and does not modify any of the variables directly. The function call itself does not change the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= `a[i]` <= 10^7, `s` is the sum of the integers from `a[l]` to `a[r]` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the list `a` starting from `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
