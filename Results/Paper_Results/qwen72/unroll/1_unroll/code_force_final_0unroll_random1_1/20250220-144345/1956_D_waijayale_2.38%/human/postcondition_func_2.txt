The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two non-negative integers `l` and `r`, and a list `a` of integers. It modifies the list `a` such that within the range `[l, r]`, if the sum of the elements in this range is less than or equal to the square of the range length, all elements in this range are set to the range length, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, the function recursively processes the subranges to the left and right of the maximum element in the range `[l, r]`. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the list `a` and the list `ops` reflects the changes made according to the conditions described.
