Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1, sorted by the absolute values of the elements in `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))` sorts the indices of the list `x` based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- `sorted_indices` is now a list of indices from 0 to n-1, where the indices are ordered such that the absolute values of the elements in `x` at those indices are in ascending order.
