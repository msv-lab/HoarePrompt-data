Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`).** 

The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and each element in `x` is unique and sorted in ascending order. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the length of the list `a`, which is also the length of the list `x`.
