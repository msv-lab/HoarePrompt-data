You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers, each of length n, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited and coef are lists of length n, initialized to False and None, respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `True`, `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if at least one `dfs(i)` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `True`, `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`. If `ok` is `True`, it means at least one `dfs(i)` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`. If `ok` is `False`, it means no `dfs(i)` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), where `x` and `y` contain integer coordinates, `r` contains integer radii, and `visited` and `coef` are initialized to `False` and `None` respectively. The function does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
