Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` sets of integer coordinates and radii, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these lists to determine if a bipartite condition is met and if a certain count (`tot`) is non-zero. The function prints 'YES' if at least one DFS call results in a bipartite condition being true and the count being non-zero; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged, while `visited` and `coef` may have some elements updated. **
