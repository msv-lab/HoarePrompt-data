To determine the output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to analyze how the variables `l` and `r` are modified within the loop. The loop iterates over the string `s` and updates `l` and `r` based on the characters encountered.

### Initial State:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '>' character in reverse order.
- `idx_B` is a list of indices where each '<' character is located in the string `s` in reverse order.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **When `s[i] == '>'`**:
   - `l` is incremented by 1.
   - `r` remains unchanged.

2. **When `s[i] == '<'`**:
   - `r` is decremented by 1.
   - `l` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- **`l`**: After the loop, `l` will be equal to the number of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- **`r`**: After the loop, `r` will be equal to the length of `B` minus the number of '<' characters in the string `s`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `l` will count the number of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- The variable `r` will count the number of '<' characters in the string `s` subtracted from the initial length of `B`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`l` is the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r` is the length of `B` minus the number of '<' characters in `s`.**
