You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The function is designed to read input data from `sys.stdin` and call the `solve` function for each set of input data.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the `solve` function has been called for each set of input data read from `sys.stdin`. The number of times the `solve` function was called is equal to the integer value read from the first line of `sys.stdin`. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads input data from `sys.stdin` and processes each set of input data by calling the `solve` function. It does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
