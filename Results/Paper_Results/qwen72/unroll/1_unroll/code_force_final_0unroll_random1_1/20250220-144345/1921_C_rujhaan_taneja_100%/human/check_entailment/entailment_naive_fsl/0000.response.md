Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send all messages without the need to turn the phone off and on. Specifically, the logic in the program incorrectly assumes that turning the phone off and on is always necessary, which is not the case.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
The initial charge `f` is 10, and the phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. The messages are to be sent at moments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. If Stepan does not turn the phone off and on, the total charge consumed is:
- (1 - 0) * 1 = 1 unit of charge for the first message
- (2 - 1) * 1 = 1 unit of charge for the second message
- (3 - 2) * 1 = 1 unit of charge for the third message
- (4 - 3) * 1 = 1 unit of charge for the fourth message
- (5 - 4) * 1 = 1 unit of charge for the fifth message

Total charge consumed: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 units of charge, which is less than the initial charge of 10. Therefore, Stepan can send all messages without turning the phone off and on, and the correct output should be "YES".

However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of sending messages without turning the phone off and on. The program only checks if the charge is sufficient when turning the phone off and on, which is not always necessary.
