### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It also reads the list of moments `arr` when Stepan needs to send messages.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to keep the phone on until the first message is sent. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends the charge consumption for the first message to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the phone can stay on from the previous message to the current message without turning off. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, it appends the charge consumption for the duration between the two messages to `array2`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The program sums the charge consumption values in `array2` and adds the charge consumption for turning the phone on and off for the remaining messages (if any).
   - It then compares this total charge consumption with the initial charge `f` to determine if Stepan can send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the phone can be turned off and on between messages to save charge.
   - It correctly checks the initial charge to ensure it can cover the first message.
   - The program also handles the case where the phone can be kept on for the entire duration without turning off.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program uses floating-point division `b / a` to check if the phone can stay on between messages. This can lead to precision issues, especially for large values of `b` and `a`.
   - The program should use integer division or comparison to avoid potential precision errors.
   - The program should ensure that the charge consumption for turning the phone on and off is correctly calculated and added to the total.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but the use of floating-point division `b / a` can lead to precision issues, which might cause incorrect results for some test cases.
- The program should use integer division or comparison to avoid these issues.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a <= f:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            else:
                if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a <= f - sum(array2):
                    array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has a potential issue with floating-point division, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program uses integer multiplication and comparison to avoid this issue.
