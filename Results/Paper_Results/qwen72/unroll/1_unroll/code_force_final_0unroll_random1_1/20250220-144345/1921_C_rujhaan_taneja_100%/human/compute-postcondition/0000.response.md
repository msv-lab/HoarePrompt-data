Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is assigned the value of `t`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, and `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and `m_i < m_{i + 1}`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
