You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

    #State: The value of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged. For each test case, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are processed, and the list `arr` is read. The list `array2` is populated based on the conditions within the loop. After processing all test cases, the loop prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the final conditions. The state of `feat`, `arr`, and `array2` is reset for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It reads the number of messages `n`, the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption when turning off and on `b`.
   - It also reads the moments `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumed for each message.
   - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge is sufficient to keep the phone on until the first message is sent. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends the charge consumed to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the time difference between consecutive messages is less than `b / a`. If so, it appends the charge consumed for that time difference to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total charge consumed by summing the elements in `array2`.
   - It then adds the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on for each message that is not in `array2` (i.e., `n - len(array2)` times).
   - Finally, it compares the total charge consumed with the initial charge `f` to determine if all messages can be sent.

4. **Logical Flaws:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on. The logic should consider the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on for each message, not just the ones that are not in `array2`.
   - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. The phone should be turned off and on if the charge required to keep it on until the first message is greater than the charge required to turn it off and on.
   - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is also incorrect. The phone should be turned off and on if the charge required to keep it on between consecutive messages is greater than the charge required to turn it off and on.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - For each message, the charge required to keep the phone on until the message is sent should be compared with the charge required to turn the phone off and on.
   - If turning the phone off and on is cheaper, the phone should be turned off and on, and the charge consumed should be `b`.
   - If keeping the phone on is cheaper, the charge consumed should be `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial charge is very large or the charge consumption per unit of time is very small, which could lead to integer overflow or incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has logical flaws in how it calculates the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, and it does not correctly handle the charge required to keep the phone on until each message is sent. Therefore, it does not correctly determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero.
