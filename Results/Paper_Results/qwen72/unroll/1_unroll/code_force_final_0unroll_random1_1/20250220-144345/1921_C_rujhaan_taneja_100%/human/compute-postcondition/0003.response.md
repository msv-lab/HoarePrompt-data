The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each with the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of elements in the list, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `f`: An integer, where 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9.
  - `a`: An integer, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
  - `b`: An integer, where 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9.
  - `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`: A list of integers, where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of the parameters for each test case. The exact nature of the processing and the results are not specified, but the function is expected to handle the constraints and relationships between the parameters as described.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a sorted list of integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
