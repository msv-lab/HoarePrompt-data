#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is the bitwise complement of an integer in `a` that has not been completely paired, with values representing the count of these complements.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` after processing the list to account for bitwise complements. Specifically, it counts the unique integers in `a` and adjusts the count based on the presence of their bitwise complements. The final state of the program is that `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a` that do not have a complete pair of their bitwise complements.
