### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation of `z`:**
   - The formula `(y + 1) // 2` is used to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. This is correct because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons, and if `y` is odd, it rounds up to ensure all icons are placed. For example, if `y = 3`, the program will calculate `z = 2`, which is correct since 3 icons require 2 screens (2 icons on one screen and 1 on another).

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The formula `15 * z - y * 4` correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. This is because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells. For example, if `z = 2` and `y = 3`, the remaining space `m` would be `15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 30 - 12 = 18`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is intended to calculate the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. However, there is a potential issue here. The formula should be `z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15` to ensure that any remaining icons that don't fill a complete screen still count as needing an additional screen. The original formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` simplifies to `z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, which is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Calculation of `z`:**
  - The formula `(y + 1) // 2` is correct and follows the problem requirements.

- **Remaining Space Calculation:**
  - The formula `15 * z - y * 4` is correct and follows the problem requirements.

- **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons:**
  - The formula `z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15` is correct. The original formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is equivalent to `z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, so it is also correct.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the minimum number of screens required for each test case.
