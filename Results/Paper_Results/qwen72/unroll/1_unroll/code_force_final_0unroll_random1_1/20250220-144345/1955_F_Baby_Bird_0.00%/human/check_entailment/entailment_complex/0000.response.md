### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.

2. **Modification of Input:**
   - The function modifies the list `p` by subtracting the remainder when each element is divided by 2. This effectively converts all elements to even numbers.
   - The transformation `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` ensures that each element in `p` is even. This is because `int(x) % 2` will be 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd, and subtracting this remainder from `x` will make `x` even.

3. **Winning Condition Calculation:**
   - The function then calculates the number of times Bob can win.
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the first three elements of the original list `p` were all odd. If they were, it adds 1 to the result.
   - The expression `sum(p) // 2` calculates the sum of the modified list `p` (which contains only even numbers) and then performs integer division by 2.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the modified list divided by 2, plus 1 if the first three elements of the original list were all odd.

### Analysis of the Winning Condition:
- **Bitwise XOR and Even/Odd Numbers:**
  - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and only if the number of odd numbers in the sequence is odd.
  - By removing numbers optimally, Eve can control the parity of the sequence to maximize Bob's wins.

- **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
  - If the first three elements of the original list `p` (representing the counts of 1, 2, and 3) are all odd, then removing one of these numbers will make the total count of odd numbers even, which means Bob wins.
  - The function correctly adds 1 to the result if the first three elements of the original list were all odd.
  - The function then divides the sum of the modified list by 2, which effectively counts the number of pairs of even numbers that can be removed, ensuring that the sequence remains even.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The transformation and the calculation of the result are consistent with the problem's requirements.
