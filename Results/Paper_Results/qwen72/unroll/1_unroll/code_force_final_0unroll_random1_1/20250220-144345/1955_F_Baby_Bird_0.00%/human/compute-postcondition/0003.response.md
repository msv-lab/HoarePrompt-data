Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a list of four integers between 0 and 200. For each test case, it modifies the list such that all elements become even by subtracting their remainder when divided by 2. It then calculates and prints a result for each test case, which is the sum of the modified list divided by 2, plus 1 if the first three elements of the original list were all odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) is unchanged after the function concludes. **
