The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state of `t` and `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head, but they are part of the overall program state.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 <= p_i <= 200, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to the values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 <= p_i <= 200, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
