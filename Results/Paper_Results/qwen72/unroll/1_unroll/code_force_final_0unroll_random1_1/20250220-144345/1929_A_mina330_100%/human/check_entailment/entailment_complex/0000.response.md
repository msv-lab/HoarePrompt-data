Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and the maximum beauty is achieved by the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. This is because the sorted array will have the smallest possible differences between consecutive elements, and the largest difference will be between the first and last elements.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`.

3. **Calculating and Printing the Result:**
   - The function prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted array, `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized.
- The maximum beauty is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

However, there is a minor issue with the function name. The function is named `func`, which is not descriptive. A more appropriate name would be `max_beauty` or something similar. This does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is a good practice to use meaningful function names.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program is correct in terms of logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
