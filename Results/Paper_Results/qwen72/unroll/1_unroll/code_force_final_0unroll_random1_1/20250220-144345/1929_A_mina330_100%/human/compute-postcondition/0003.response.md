The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a_list`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `a_list` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the inner lists has the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `a_list`. The result for each test case is based on the elements of the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `a_list`, a list of lists where each inner list contains integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases in `a_list`.**
