Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array. However, the maximum beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `1` (which is correct in this case, but not for all cases). A more illustrative example is:
```
3
5
1 3 5 7 9
```
The expected output is `8` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 9, 3, 7, 5]`), but the program will output `8` (which is correct here, but not for all cases).

A more critical example is:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output is `3` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`), but the program will output `3` (which is correct here, but not for all cases).

However, the program fails in cases where the array has more than two distinct elements. For example:
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `6` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`), but the program will output `4` (which is incorrect).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
