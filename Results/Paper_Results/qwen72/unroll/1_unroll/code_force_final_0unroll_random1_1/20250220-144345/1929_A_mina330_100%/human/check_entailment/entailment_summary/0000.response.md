Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any order. The beauty is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This is because all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

The provided program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array. This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the maximum and minimum elements are at the ends of the array, and the difference between these two elements will indeed give the maximum possible beauty.

However, there is a minor issue with the program: it does not handle the case where the array has duplicate elements correctly. For example, in the second test case where all elements are the same, the program will still print the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is 0. This is correct, but the program should be more explicit in handling such cases.

Despite this, the program's logic is sound and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
