You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list `a` has been printed. The variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been used and modified within the loop, but their final states are not directly relevant to the output. The initial state of `ntest` remains unchanged, and the list of lists provided as input has been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array. However, the maximum beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `1` (which is correct in this case, but not for all cases). A more illustrative example is:
```
3
5
1 3 5 7 9
```
The expected output is `8` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 9, 3, 7, 5]`), but the program will output `8` (which is correct here, but not for all cases).

A more critical example is:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output is `3` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`), but the program will output `3` (which is correct here, but not for all cases).

However, the program fails in cases where the array has more than two distinct elements. For example:
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `6` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`), but the program will output `4` (which is incorrect).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
