You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of strings as input, where each string represents a row in the n x n binary grid, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1. The function should return "SQUARE" if the shape is a square, and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is an empty list after each iteration of the outer loop. The function will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each grid based on the counts of '1's in the rows.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of strings representing an n x n binary grid (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and returns "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square shape, and "TRIANGLE" if the grid contains a triangle shape.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
