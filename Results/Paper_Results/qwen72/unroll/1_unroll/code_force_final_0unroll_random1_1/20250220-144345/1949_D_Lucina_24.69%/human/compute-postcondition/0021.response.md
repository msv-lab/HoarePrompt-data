Postcondition: **The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, and the variable `n` remain unchanged. The lists `sa` and `sb` will also remain unchanged. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the list `sa` will now contain the indices of rows and columns where there are 'F' (funny) transitions but no 'S' (scary) transitions, as well as any additional indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The loop will print a series of strings `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`, where each string `nx` is constructed by replacing '?' characters in `xx[i]` with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the loop prints a series of strings `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each string `nx` is constructed by iterating through the columns `j` from 1 to `n`. If the element `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
