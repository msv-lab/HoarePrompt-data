### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing the transition video plan.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the counts of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) transitions for each row and column.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string as the first element to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through each row and column of the input matrix.
   - If a cell contains 'F', it increments the corresponding counts in `a` for both the row and column.
   - If a cell contains 'S', it increments the corresponding counts in `b` for both the row and column.

3. **Identifying Rows/Columns with Only One Type of Transition:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of rows and columns that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions, respectively.
   - It populates `sa` with indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` with indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program checks if the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it appends indices with no transitions (both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0) to `sa`.
   - It then constructs the output matrix by replacing '?' characters in the input matrix with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it appends indices with no transitions to `sb`.
   - It constructs the output matrix by replacing '?' characters with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed output matrix, ensuring that the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type consecutively.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Diagonal Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the symmetry of the input matrix and the diagonal (i.e., `xx[i][i]` is always '.'), which is consistent with the problem description.

- **Counting and Identifying Rows/Columns:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each row and column.
  - It correctly identifies rows and columns that have only one type of transition and stores them in `sa` and `sb`.

- **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program's strategy for assigning undecided transitions is to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions.
  - It ensures that the first quarter of the indices with only one type of transition (or no transitions) are assigned the opposite type to avoid long sequences of the same type.
  - This approach is designed to prevent more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Output Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that the output matrix is symmetric and that the diagonal remains unchanged.
  - It also ensures that the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type, which is a key requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input, count transitions, and assign undecided transitions in a way that satisfies the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
