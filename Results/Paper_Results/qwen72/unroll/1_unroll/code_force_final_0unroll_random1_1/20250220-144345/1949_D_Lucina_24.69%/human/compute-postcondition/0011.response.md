The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
