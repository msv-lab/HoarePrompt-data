The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the first integer from the input split by spaces. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`func` is expected to be called with no arguments, `n` is the number of sides of a regular polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `t` is the first integer from the input split by spaces and `t` must be non-zero**
