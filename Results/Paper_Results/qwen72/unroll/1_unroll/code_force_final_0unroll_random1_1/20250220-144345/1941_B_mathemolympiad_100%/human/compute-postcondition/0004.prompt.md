You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is modified for each test case, but the final state of `a` is not predictable without the specific input values. The variable `numTest` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop completes. The variable `stop` is reset to `False` at the beginning of each test case. The loop prints 'NO' if any element in `a` is negative during the iteration or if the last two elements of `a` are not zero after the loop. It prints 'YES' if the last two elements of `a` are zero after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, with 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_j` is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
