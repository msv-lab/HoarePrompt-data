### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element (i.e., `i` ranges from 0 to `n-3`).
   - For each element `a[i]`, it performs the operation `a[i] -= opNum`, `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, where `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the elements at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` by `opNum`, `2 * opNum`, and `opNum` respectively, which aligns with the problem's operation.

3. **Stopping Condition:**
   - If any element in the array becomes negative during the operation, the program prints 'NO' and stops processing the current test case. This is correct because if any element becomes negative, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operation.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO'. This is necessary because the operation only affects elements up to `i+2`, and the last two elements must be checked separately to ensure they are zero.
   - If the last two elements are zero, it prints 'YES'.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `a[i + 1]` or `a[i + 2]` become negative after the operation. However, the logic of the program ensures that if any element becomes negative, it will print 'NO' and stop processing the current test case.
- **Summation Check:**
  - The program does not check if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be zeroed out. However, the problem statement does not explicitly require this check, and the provided logic should handle it implicitly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the operations and checks for negative elements and the final state of the array. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should work as intended.
