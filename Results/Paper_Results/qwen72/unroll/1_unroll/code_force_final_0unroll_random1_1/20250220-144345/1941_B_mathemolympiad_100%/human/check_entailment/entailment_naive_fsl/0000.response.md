Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that the operation can be applied to any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) multiple times, and it does not correctly check if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The expected output is "YES" because the array can be reduced to zero using the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at \( i = 2 \):
   - \( a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - \( a_2 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] \)

2. Apply the operation at \( i = 3 \):
   - \( a_2 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (but this should not be possible since the operation should only be applied if all elements are non-negative)
   - \( a_3 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_4 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, -1, 0, 1, 1] \)

3. Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \):
   - \( a_3 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (again, this should not be possible)
   - \( a_4 = 1 - 2 = -1 \)
   - \( a_5 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, -1, -1, -1, 0] \)

However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly modifies the array and does not handle the case where the operation should be applied multiple times to different indices. The correct approach should be to check if the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices, which would indicate that the array can be reduced to zero.
