You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if any element in `a` is negative, and if so, prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case. If no element is negative, it performs a series of operations on the list `a` and checks if the last two elements of `a` are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is modified for each test case, but its final state is not predictable without the specific input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation that subtracts 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

2. **Analyzing the Operation:**
   - Each operation affects three consecutive elements of the array.
   - The operation can be applied multiple times to the same index or different indices.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The operation can only decrease the values of the array.
   - If any element in the array is negative at any point, it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - The operation can be applied in such a way that the first element of the array is reduced to zero, and then the next elements are adjusted accordingly.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and initializes a flag `stop` to `False`.
   - It iterates through the array from the first element to the third-to-last element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it performs the operation to reduce `a[i]` to zero and adjusts the next two elements accordingly.
   - If any element becomes negative during this process, it prints "NO" and sets `stop` to `True` to break out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only three elements.
   - It also handles cases where the array has more than three elements and ensures that the operation is applied correctly.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has fewer than three elements, but the problem description guarantees that `n` is at least 3.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the array is valid (i.e., all elements are non-negative) before starting the operations, but it implicitly does so by checking for negative values during the operations.

7. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operation.
   - It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
