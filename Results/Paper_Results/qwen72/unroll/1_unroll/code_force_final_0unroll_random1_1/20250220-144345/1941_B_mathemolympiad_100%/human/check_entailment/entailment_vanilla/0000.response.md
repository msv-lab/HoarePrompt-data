### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation that subtracts 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

2. **Analyzing the Operation:**
   - Each operation affects three consecutive elements of the array.
   - The operation can be applied multiple times to the same index or different indices.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The operation can only decrease the values of the array.
   - If any element in the array is negative at any point, it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - The operation can be applied in such a way that the first element of the array is reduced to zero, and then the next elements are adjusted accordingly.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and initializes a flag `stop` to `False`.
   - It iterates through the array from the first element to the third-to-last element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it performs the operation to reduce `a[i]` to zero and adjusts the next two elements accordingly.
   - If any element becomes negative during this process, it prints "NO" and sets `stop` to `True` to break out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only three elements.
   - It also handles cases where the array has more than three elements and ensures that the operation is applied correctly.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has fewer than three elements, but the problem description guarantees that `n` is at least 3.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the array is valid (i.e., all elements are non-negative) before starting the operations, but it implicitly does so by checking for negative values during the operations.

7. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operation.
   - It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
