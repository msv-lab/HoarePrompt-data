You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if any element in `a` is negative, and if so, prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case. If no element is negative, it performs a series of operations on the list `a` and checks if the last two elements of `a` are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is modified for each test case, but its final state is not predictable without the specific input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that the operation can be applied to any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) multiple times, and it does not correctly check if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The expected output is "YES" because the array can be reduced to zero using the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at \( i = 2 \):
   - \( a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - \( a_2 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] \)

2. Apply the operation at \( i = 3 \):
   - \( a_2 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (but this should not be possible since the operation should only be applied if all elements are non-negative)
   - \( a_3 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_4 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, -1, 0, 1, 1] \)

3. Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \):
   - \( a_3 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (again, this should not be possible)
   - \( a_4 = 1 - 2 = -1 \)
   - \( a_5 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - Resulting array: \( [0, -1, -1, -1, 0] \)

However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly modifies the array and does not handle the case where the operation should be applied multiple times to different indices. The correct approach should be to check if the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices, which would indicate that the array can be reduced to zero.
