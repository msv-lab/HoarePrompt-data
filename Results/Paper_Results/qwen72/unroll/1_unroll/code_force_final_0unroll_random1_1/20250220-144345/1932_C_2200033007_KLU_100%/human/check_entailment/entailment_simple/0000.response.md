### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that will be removed from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - The function iterates over the command string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they were removed.

3. **Cumulative Product Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative product.
   - The function iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m`.
     - It appends the current value of `p` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans` in reversed order.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly processes the commands and constructs the list `b` with the elements removed in the order specified by `s`.
- The cumulative product calculation is also correct, as it multiplies the elements in reverse order and takes the modulo `m` at each step.
- The final step of reversing `ans` ensures that the output matches the order of commands in `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and computes the required remainders. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
