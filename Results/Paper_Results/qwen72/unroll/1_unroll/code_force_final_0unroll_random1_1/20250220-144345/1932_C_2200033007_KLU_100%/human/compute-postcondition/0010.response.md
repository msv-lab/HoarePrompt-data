The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a` and the string `s`.
- `m` is a positive integer used as the modulus for the calculations.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 10,000.
- `s` is a string of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'.

The function returns a list `ans` in reversed order. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`. The list `b` is derived from `a` by rearranging its elements based on the characters in `s`. The product `p` of all elements in `b` is also taken modulo `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a list `ans` in reversed order, where each element in `ans` is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`. The list `b` is a rearranged version of `a` based on the characters in `s`, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`.**
