### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Product Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and takes the modulus `m`.
   - It appends the result to `ans`.
   - This part of the program is also correct. By iterating through `b` in reverse order, the program ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, matching the order of the commands.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
  - `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4).
  - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
  - `s` is a string of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'.
  - This matches the problem description and constraints.

- **State After Command Execution:**
  - `b` is a list of `n` integers where the elements are rearranged based on the characters in `s`.
  - `l` is `n` and `r` is `-1` after processing all commands.
  - This is correct because `l` and `r` are used to traverse the array `a` from both ends, and after `n` commands, all elements should have been removed.

- **State After Product Calculation:**
  - `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order modulo `m`.
  - `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`.
  - This is correct because the product is calculated step by step, and the results are stored in `ans` in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required remainders. The annotations and the reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
