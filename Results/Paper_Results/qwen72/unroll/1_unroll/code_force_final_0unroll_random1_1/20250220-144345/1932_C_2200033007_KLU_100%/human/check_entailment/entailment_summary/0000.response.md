Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and output the remainder of the product of the array's elements modulo `m` at each step. However, the implementation has a logical flaw in how it processes the commands and calculates the product.

1. **Command Processing**: The function `func_1` processes the commands by appending elements to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part is correct in terms of selecting the elements, but it does not directly help in calculating the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step.

2. **Product Calculation**: The function calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the same as calculating the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step. The correct approach would be to maintain a running product of the elements in `a` and update this product by removing the appropriate element based on the command.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect because it does not reflect the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step.

To correct this, the program should maintain a running product of the elements in `a` and update this product by dividing it by the element being removed at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for v in a:
        product = (product * v) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m
            r -= 1
    return b
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `product` to the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- For each command, we append the current `product` to the list `b`.
- If the command is 'L', we remove the leftmost element by dividing the `product` by `a[l]` using the modular inverse (calculated using `pow(a[l], m-2, m)`).
- If the command is 'R', we remove the rightmost element by dividing the `product` by `a[r]` using the modular inverse.

Given the provided program, the correctness is **False** because it does not correctly maintain and update the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step.

Correctness: **False**
