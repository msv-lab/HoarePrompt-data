Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), s is a string of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0, r is n - 1.**

The value of `r` is set to `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values. The variable `r` now holds the value of `n - 1`, which is a positive integer less than `n`.
