The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from the input. It then prints the sum of the maximum value in the list `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are reset for each test case, and the function does not modify any external variables or state.
