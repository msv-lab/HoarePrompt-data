The only objects in the loop head are the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the list `cas_de_test`. The loop will execute if `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` at the start of the first iteration.

So, for the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` should be initialized to the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`**
