### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test` as input.
   - The integer `t` is validated to be within the range 1 to 500.
   - Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).

2. **Total Points and Draws:**
   - The total points scored by all three players is calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - For the scores to be valid, the total points must be even (`total_points % 2 == 0`). This is because each game can result in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw).

3. **Total Matches:**
   - The total number of matches played is calculated as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - The function checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the results list. This is because:
     - Each player can only play a maximum of 3 matches (since there are only 3 players and each match involves 2 players).
     - The highest possible score for any player is the total number of matches played.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The number of draws is calculated using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the other two players can be attributed to wins and losses. The remaining points, if any, must be from draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, so -1 is appended to the results list.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2` (since each draw contributes 2 points).

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns a list `resultats` containing the results for each test case.
   - The results are printed using `print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly checks if the total points are even.
- It correctly calculates the total number of matches and checks if it is within the valid range.
- The formula for calculating the number of draws is derived correctly from the problem constraints.
- The program handles the edge cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games by appending -1 to the results list.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
