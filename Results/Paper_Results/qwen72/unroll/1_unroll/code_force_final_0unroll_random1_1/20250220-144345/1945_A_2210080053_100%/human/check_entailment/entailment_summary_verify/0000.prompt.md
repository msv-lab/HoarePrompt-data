You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input, starting from the second line. For each line, it parses three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. It then increments `b` by `c` and prints a value based on the condition `c < b % 3`. If the condition is true, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `a - -b // 3`. The function does not return any value, but it processes and prints a result for each line of input after the first line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the line `b += c` is problematic because it assumes that all universals can be used to fulfill the requirements of extroverts, which is not always the case. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `2`

Explanation of the counterexample:
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need a tent with exactly 3 people, but there is only 1 universal, which means it is impossible to form a tent with 3 people for the extroverts.
- Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program outputs `2`.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of universals is insufficient to form the required tents for extroverts.
