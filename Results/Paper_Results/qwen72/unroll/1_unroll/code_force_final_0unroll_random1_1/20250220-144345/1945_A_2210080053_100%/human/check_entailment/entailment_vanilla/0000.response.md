### Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a way to read from standard input in Python.
   - The first line is skipped ( `[1:]` ), and each subsequent line is processed as a test case.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Logic for Tents**:
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` to account for the flexibility of universals.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents needed:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled by extroverts and universals.
     - `- -b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3` because the double negative cancels out.
     - `a + b // 3` is the total number of tents needed if all extroverts and universals can be accommodated in groups of three.
   - The expression `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents:
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3, which represents the number of additional people needed to fill the last tent.
     - If `c` (the number of universals) is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the last tent, and the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.
   - If it is possible to accommodate all participants, it prints the number of tents.
   - If it is impossible, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so `a` tents are required for introverts.
- **Extroverts and Universals**: Extroverts need to be in groups of three. If there are not enough universals to fill the last tent, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Universals**: Universals can fill any remaining spots, so they are added to the extroverts to maximize the use of tents.

### Potential Issues:
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is mathematically equivalent to `a + b // 3`, but it is not the most readable or intuitive way to write it.
- The program does not handle the case where `b` is zero and `c` is less than `a` (all introverts and no extroverts).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the main logic of accommodating introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- However, the expression `a - -b // 3` is not the most clear and could be simplified to `a + b // 3`.
- The program does not handle the edge case where `b` is zero and `c` is less than `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with readability and an edge case that is not handled. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
