Output State: **a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, but the value of the expression (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3] is printed for each line of input after the first line. The values of a, b, and c are updated for each iteration based on the input, and b is incremented by c.**

To break it down:
- The loop reads each line of input after the first line.
- For each line, it updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the input.
- It then increments `b` by `c`.
- The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is evaluated and printed for each line.
- The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop depends on the last line of input.

The loop does not change the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` globally; instead, it updates them for each iteration based on the input. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated for each line of input, and the expression is printed accordingly.
