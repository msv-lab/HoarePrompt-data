Output State: **`leaves` is a list containing all the nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection (i.e., their corresponding list in `tree` has a length of 1). `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list containing all the integers that are connected to the key by an edge in the `edges` list. The lists are not necessarily sorted. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.**
