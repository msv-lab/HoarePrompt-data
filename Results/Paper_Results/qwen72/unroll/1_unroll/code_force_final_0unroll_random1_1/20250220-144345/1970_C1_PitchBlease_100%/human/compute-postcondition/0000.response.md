Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, with each node having at least one neighbor except for the two leaves. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**
