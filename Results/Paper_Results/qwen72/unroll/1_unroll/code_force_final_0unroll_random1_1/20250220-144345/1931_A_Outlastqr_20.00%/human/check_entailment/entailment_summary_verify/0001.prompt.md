You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not return any value but prints a series of three-letter words to the console. It reads an integer from the user, which specifies the number of iterations, and for each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Based on the value of `n`, it constructs and prints a three-letter word. If `n` is greater than 52, the word is formed by appending 'zz' to the `n - 53`-th letter of the alphabet. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the word is formed by appending 'z' to the `n - 28`-th letter of the alphabet, with 'a' as the first letter. If `n` is between 3 and 26, the word is formed by appending the `n - 3`-th letter of the alphabet, with 'aa' as the first two letters. After the loop completes, the `word` variable is reset to an empty string for each iteration, and the `alphabet` variable remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters must equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a 3-letter word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Constructing the Word**:
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine the lexicographically smallest word:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This is because the maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to reach `n`.
     - If `n > 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and then 'z'. This is because the maximum sum of the last two letters is 52, so the first letter is 'a' and the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to reach `n`.
     - If `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`. This is because the sum of the first two letters is 2 (1 + 1), so the third letter must be `n - 2`.

4. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - For `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is correct because the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to reach `n`, and 'zz' is the largest possible combination for the last two letters.
   - For `26 < n <= 52`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is correct because the first letter is 'a' (1), and the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to reach `n`, with 'z' being the largest possible third letter.
   - For `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is correct because the first two letters are 'a' (1 + 1), and the third letter must be `n - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
     - For `n = 52`, the word is 'azz' (1 + 26 + 25).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for the given sum `n`.

Correctness: **True**
