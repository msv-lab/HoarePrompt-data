Output State: **The loop prints a series of three-letter words based on the input values of `n` for each iteration. The `word` variable is reset to an empty string at the beginning of each iteration, and the final state of `word` after the loop finishes is an empty string. The `alphabet` variable remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
