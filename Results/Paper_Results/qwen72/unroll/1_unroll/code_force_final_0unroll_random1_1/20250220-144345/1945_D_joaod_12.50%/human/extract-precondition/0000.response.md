Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person and the cost to bribe each person between the current and target positions, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
