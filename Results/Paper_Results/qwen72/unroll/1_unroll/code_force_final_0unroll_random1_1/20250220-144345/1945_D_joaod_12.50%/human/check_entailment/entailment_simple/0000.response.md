### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in the queue) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It then reads the two lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, which represent the costs to bribe the i-th person and the costs to bribe each person between the current and target positions, respectively.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is correct because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - It also initializes `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will be used to track the minimum cost to reach the desired position.

4. **Loop Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning using a for loop with `v` ranging from `na_frente` to 0.
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, it checks if the current total cost plus the cost to bribe the person at position `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

5. **Handling Positions Greater than `pos_final`:**
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, it simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `best` for each test case, which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired position.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. It iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, ensuring that it considers the cost to bribe each person and the cost to bribe each person between the current and target positions.
- The use of `best` to track the minimum cost is appropriate and ensures that the program finds the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
