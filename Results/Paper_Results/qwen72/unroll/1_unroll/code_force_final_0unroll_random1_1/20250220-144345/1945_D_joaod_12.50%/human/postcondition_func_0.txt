The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a queue of people. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends without modifying the input variables or any global state.
