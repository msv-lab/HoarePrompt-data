Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` (number of people) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), followed by the lists `a` (cost to swap with the person at position `j`) and `b` (cost to pay each person between `j` and `i`).

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `na_frente` to `n - 1` and `pos_final` to `m - 1` to account for zero-based indexing. It also initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`).

3. **Loop Through People**: The program iterates from the last person to the first person in the queue (from `na_frente` to 0). This is appropriate because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is because Kirill will choose the cheaper option to either swap with the person at position `v` or pay the people between `v` and the current position.

5. **Output**: After processing all positions, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already at the end of the queue) correctly.

7. **Optimization**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the minimum cost by iterating through the list in reverse and keeping track of the best cost found so far.

8. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should handle the given problem description and constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
