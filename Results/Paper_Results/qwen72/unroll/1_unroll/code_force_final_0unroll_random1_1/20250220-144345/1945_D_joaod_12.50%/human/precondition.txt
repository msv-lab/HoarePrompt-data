t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a and b are lists of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the cost to bribe the i-th person and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
