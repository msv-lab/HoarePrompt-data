To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the `custos` list, as it is the only object directly involved in the loop head. The loop will execute if `custos` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to influence the loop's execution.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases.
- The length of `custos` is equal to `x`.

For the loop to execute, `custos` must have at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `custos` is not empty.

State: **`custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases, and `custos` must have at least one element.**
