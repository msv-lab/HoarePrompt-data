The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person. `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` are integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in the queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing the costs to bribe individuals. It returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case.**
