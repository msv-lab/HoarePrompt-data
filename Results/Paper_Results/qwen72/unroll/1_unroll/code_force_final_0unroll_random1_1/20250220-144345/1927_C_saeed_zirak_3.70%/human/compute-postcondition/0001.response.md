Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output 'yes' if it is possible to select exactly k/2 elements from list a and k/2 elements from list b such that all selected elements are unique and within the range 1 to k, otherwise it will output 'no'. The values of t, n, m, k, a, and b remain unchanged after the loop execution.**
