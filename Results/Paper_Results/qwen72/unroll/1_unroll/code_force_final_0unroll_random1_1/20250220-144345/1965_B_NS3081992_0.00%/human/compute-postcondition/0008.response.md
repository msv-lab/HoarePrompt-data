The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. The loop `for i in range(2, l)` will execute if `l` is greater than 2. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`
- 2 <= n <= 10^6
- `k` is 1
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix
- `l` is the length of `b`
- `n` is not equal to 2
- `ans` is [2, 3]

We need to ensure that `l` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. The length `l` of the binary representation `b` of `n` must be greater than 2. Since `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` is at least 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3, which has a binary representation of "11" (length 2). Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `l` is greater than 2. 

For the loop to execute:
- `l` must be greater than 2
- `i` should start at 2

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 2, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3], `i` is 2**
