Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_14` does not always ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, while also ensuring that for all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`.

The program generates the sequence:
```
1 2 4 7 9 17
```

However, this sequence does not meet the requirements because:
- The sum of the subsequence `[1, 2, 4, 1]` is `8`, which is equal to `k`. This violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.
- Additionally, the sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to `8 - 1 = 7` (since `7` is already in the sequence, it cannot be part of another subsequence that sums to `7`).

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for this input.
