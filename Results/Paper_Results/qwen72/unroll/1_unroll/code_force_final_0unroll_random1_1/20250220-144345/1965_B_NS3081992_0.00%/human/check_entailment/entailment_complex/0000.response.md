Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, and for each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read the values of `n` and `k`. Both functions are correctly implemented to read and parse the input as required.

2. **Base Case for `k = 1`**: When `k = 1`, the function `func_14()` correctly handles the special case where `n = 2` by returning the string '1\n2'. For other values of `n`, it constructs a sequence that avoids a subsequence sum of 1 but includes all other sums up to `n`. This is achieved by starting with the sequence `[2, 3]` and appending powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **General Case for `k > 1`**: When `k > 1`, the function `func_14()` constructs a sequence that avoids a subsequence sum of `k` but includes all other sums up to `n`. It does this by:
   - Starting with the sequence of powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - Adding `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
   - Adding `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
   - Appending the remaining powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)` to cover all other sums up to `n`.

4. **Output**: The function `func_15()` correctly prints the output for each test case by calling `func_14()` and writing the result to the standard output followed by a newline.

5. **Constraints**: The program ensures that the sequence `ans` is of size at most 25, which is within the problem's constraints. The sequence is constructed to avoid the sum `k` while including all other sums up to `n`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `n = 2` and `k = 1` correctly, and the general case for `k > 1` also seems to be correctly implemented.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem description and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
