Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is a list containing [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.***
