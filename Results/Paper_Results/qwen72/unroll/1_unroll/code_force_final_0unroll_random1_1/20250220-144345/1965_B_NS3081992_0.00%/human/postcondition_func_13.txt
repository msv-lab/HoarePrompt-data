The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. The function internally uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a space-separated string of the sequence [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, the function returns a space-separated string of the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
