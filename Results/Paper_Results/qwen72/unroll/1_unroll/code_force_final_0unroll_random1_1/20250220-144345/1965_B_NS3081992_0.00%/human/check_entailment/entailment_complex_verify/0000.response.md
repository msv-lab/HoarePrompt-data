### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the function `func_14` in detail to determine if it correctly handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

#### Function `func_14` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   n, k = func_7()
   b = bin(n)[2:]
   l = len(b)
   ```
   - `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.

2. **Handling the Case `k == 1`:**
   ```python
   if k == 1:
       if n == 2:
           return '1\n2'
       ans = [2, 3]
       for i in range(2, l):
           ans.append(2 ** i)
   ```
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the sequence `1\n2`.
   - If `k == 1` and `n != 2`, the function initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 from `2^2` to `2^(l-1)`.

3. **Handling the Case `k != 1`:**
   ```python
   else:
       bk = bin(k)[2:]
       ans = []
       lk = len(bk)
       for i in range(lk - 1):
           ans.append(2 ** i)
       ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
       ans.append(k + 1)
       ans.append(2 * k + 1)
       for i in range(lk, l):
           ans.append(2 ** i)
   ```
   - If `k != 1`, the function initializes `ans` with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)`.

#### Evaluation of the Counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 8`, `k = 8`
- **Expected Output:** A sequence `a` such that:
  - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `8`.
  - For all `1 <= v <= 8` where `v != 8`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

- **Actual Output:**
  ```python
  1 2 4 7 9 17
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 17]` does not meet the requirements because:
    - The subsequence `[1, 2, 4, 1]` sums to `8`, which is equal to `k`. This violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.
    - The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to `7` (since `7` is already in the sequence, it cannot be part of another subsequence that sums to `7`).

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The function `func_14` does not correctly handle the case where `k` is a power of 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Specifically, the sequence generated for `n = 8` and `k = 8` includes `7` and a subsequence that sums to `8`, which violates the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description, particularly for the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`.
