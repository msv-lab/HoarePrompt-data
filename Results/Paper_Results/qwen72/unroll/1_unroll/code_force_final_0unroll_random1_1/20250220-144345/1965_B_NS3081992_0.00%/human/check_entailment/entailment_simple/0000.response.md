### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`, which correctly reads an integer from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program uses the binary representation of `n` and `k` to determine the sequence `ans`.
   - For `k == 1`, it constructs a sequence that avoids the sum `k` and ensures all other sums from 1 to `n` are possible.
   - For `k != 1`, it constructs a sequence that avoids the sum `k` and ensures all other sums from 1 to `n` are possible by including powers of 2 and specific values to cover the required sums.

3. **Sequence Construction:**
   - When `k == 1` and `n != 2`, the sequence is constructed as `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - When `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed as `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k-1-sum(ans), k+1, 2*k+1, 2^(lk), ..., 2^(l-1)]`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case, ensuring that the sequence meets the problem's requirements.
   - The output format is correct, with the sequence elements joined by spaces and each test case's result on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` and `k == 1` by returning the specific sequence `1\n2`.
   - The program ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the input, constructs the sequence according to the problem's requirements, and outputs the sequence in the correct format. The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible. The edge cases are also handled appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
