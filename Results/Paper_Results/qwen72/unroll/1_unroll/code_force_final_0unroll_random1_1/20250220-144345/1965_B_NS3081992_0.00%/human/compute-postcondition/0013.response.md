Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the string `bk` and assigns it to the variable `lk`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `lk` is now the length of the binary representation of `k` as a string.
