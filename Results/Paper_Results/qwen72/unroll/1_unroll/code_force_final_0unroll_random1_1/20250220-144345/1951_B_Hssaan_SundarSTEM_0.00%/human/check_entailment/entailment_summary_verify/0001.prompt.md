You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

                break

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It then performs a series of swaps and checks to determine the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a non-decreasing order starting from the first element by either keeping the initial swap or swapping back the first and k-th elements. The result for each test case is printed. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged after each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a sequence of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of matches won by a specific cow (cow `k`).
   - We can swap the position of cow `k` with another cow once, or choose to do nothing.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows and stores them in a list `s`.

3. **First Simulation (Without Swap):**
   - The program swaps the rating of the first cow with the rating of cow `k` to simulate the scenario where cow `k` starts at the first position.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 to count the number of matches won by cow `k`.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the first cow (which is now the rating of cow `k`).
   - It iterates through the list `s` starting from the second element:
     - If the current cow's rating is greater than `h`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is incremented.
   - The index `j` is used to track the position where the loop breaks.

4. **Second Simulation (With Swap):**
   - The program swaps the ratings back to their original positions.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0 to count the number of matches won by cow `k` after a potential swap.
   - It swaps the rating of cow `k` with the rating at position `p` (the position where the first simulation broke).
   - It initializes `z` to 0 to track if the first cow has been encountered.
   - It iterates through the list `s`:
     - If the current cow's rating is equal to `h` and it is not the first cow, `ans1` is incremented.
     - If the current cow's rating is greater than `h`, the loop breaks.
     - If `z` is 1 (indicating the first cow has been encountered), `ans1` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **First Simulation:**
  - This part correctly simulates the scenario where cow `k` starts at the first position.
  - It counts the number of matches won by cow `k` until it loses.

- **Second Simulation:**
  - This part simulates the scenario where cow `k` is swapped to a position where it can potentially win more matches.
  - The logic for counting the matches won by cow `k` after the swap is correct, but it seems to have a redundant check for `z`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Check:**
  - The variable `z` is used to track if the first cow has been encountered, but this is not necessary for the logic of counting matches.
  - The condition `if i == h` and `if s[0] != h` is redundant and can be simplified.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should handle edge cases where `k` is 1 or `n` correctly.
  - The program should also handle cases where the cow `k` is already the strongest cow.

### Correctness:
- Despite the redundant check, the program's logic is fundamentally correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and should solve the problem as described. However, it can be optimized by removing the redundant check for `z`.
