The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the initial state for the loop to begin.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, `n` (the length of `s`) must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is an empty list; `balance` is 0; `i` is 0**
