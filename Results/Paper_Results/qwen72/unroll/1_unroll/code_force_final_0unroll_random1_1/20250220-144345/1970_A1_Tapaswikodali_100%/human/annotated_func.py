#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB, where the balance of infoA is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and the balance of infoB is a different integer representing the balance of another prefix in the same or a different parentheses sequence.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in the sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, where both `infoA` and `infoB` have the same `balance` value, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` values of `infoA` and `infoB` are different, it returns the difference between their `balance` values. If the `balance` values are the same, it returns the difference between their `position` values. The function does not modify the input objects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `balance` is 0, `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance value, index, and character at that index of the string `s`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string containing the characters from `s` in reverse order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return any value but prints a string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on their balance values and positions. Specifically, the characters are sorted such that those with the same balance value are ordered by their position in descending order, and then the characters are concatenated into a single string.
