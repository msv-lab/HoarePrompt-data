You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB, where the balance of infoA is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and the balance of infoB is a different integer representing the balance of another prefix in the same or a different parentheses sequence.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in the sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, where both `infoA` and `infoB` have the same `balance` value, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` values of `infoA` and `infoB` are different, it returns the difference between their `balance` values. If the `balance` values are the same, it returns the difference between their `position` values. The function does not modify the input objects.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `balance` is 0, `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance value, index, and character at that index of the string `s`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string containing the characters from `s` in reverse order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return any value but prints a string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on their balance values and positions. Specifically, the characters are sorted such that those with the same balance value are ordered by their position in descending order, and then the characters are concatenated into a single string.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It computes the balance of the prefix for each character, stores this information along with the position and character, and then sorts this information based on the balance and position as specified. Finally, it constructs and prints the new sequence based on the sorted order of the balance and position, which matches the expected output for the balanced shuffle operation. The program handles the input constraints and the logic for sorting and constructing the sequence is correct. Therefore, it is correct for every potential case.
