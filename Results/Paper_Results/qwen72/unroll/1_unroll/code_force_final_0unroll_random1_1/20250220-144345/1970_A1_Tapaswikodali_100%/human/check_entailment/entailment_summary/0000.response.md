Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires transforming a balanced parentheses sequence by applying a specific sorting operation based on the balance of prefixes and the positions of the characters. The goal is to produce a new balanced parentheses sequence that follows the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to define the sorting criteria for the `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their `balance` attribute. If the `balance` values are different, it sorts them by the `balance` value in ascending order.
   - If the `balance` values are the same, it sorts them by the `position` value in descending order.
   - This matches the problem's requirement for sorting the columns of the table.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and processes it to produce the balanced shuffle.
   - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects for each character in the input string.
   - It iterates through the string, maintaining a running balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
   - After constructing the list, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the criteria defined in `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sorting logic in `func_2` correctly uses the `func_1` comparison logic to sort the `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - The construction of the result string by concatenating the characters in the sorted list ensures that the output is a valid balanced shuffle of the input string.
   - The example provided in the problem description is correctly handled by the program.

Given that the program follows the problem description and the execution summaries confirm that the functions behave as expected, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
