The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the condition of a list and the return value of a function `func_1(list, n)`, but these details do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
