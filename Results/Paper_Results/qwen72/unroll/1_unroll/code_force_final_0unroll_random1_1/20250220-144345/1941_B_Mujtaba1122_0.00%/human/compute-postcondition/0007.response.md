The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list` and `n`. `list` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list). The function returns a value based on these parameters.

However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the given information. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer or assume the intended behavior. Given the constraints and the typical use cases for such functions, a common functionality could be to return a subset of the list based on `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It returns a value based on the list and the integer `n`, but the specific return value is not provided.**
