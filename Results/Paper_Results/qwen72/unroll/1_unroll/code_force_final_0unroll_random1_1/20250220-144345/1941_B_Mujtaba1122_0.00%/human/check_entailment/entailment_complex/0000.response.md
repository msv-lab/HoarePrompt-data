Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - **Implementation**: It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct. It accurately checks if all elements in the list are zero.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero by applying the operation described in the problem.
   - **Implementation**:
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
     - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
     - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( list[i-1] \), \( list[i] \), and \( list[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
     - The loop continues until the conditions are no longer met for the current index.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic of the function is flawed. The operation is applied using `list[i-1]` as the decrement value, which is incorrect. The operation should decrement \( list[i-1] \), \( list[i] \), and \( list[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as the decrement value, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - For example, if `list[i-1]` is 2, the current implementation will decrement `list[i-1]` by 2, `list[i]` by 4, and `list[i+1]` by 2, which is not the intended operation.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
     - The correct sequence of operations can make all elements zero:
       - Apply operation at \( i=4 \): `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
       - Apply operation at \( i=3 \): `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
       - Apply operation at \( i=2 \): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
       - Apply operation at \( i=4 \): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
     - The current implementation will not correctly perform these operations due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 2**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
     - It is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.
     - The current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 3**: `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
     - The correct sequence of operations can make all elements zero:
       - Apply operation at \( i=3 \): `[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]`
       - Apply operation at \( i=2 \): `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]`
       - Apply operation at \( i=3 \): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
     - The current implementation will not correctly perform these operations due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 4**: `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`
     - It is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.
     - The current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 5**: `[1, 2, 7, 2]`
     - It is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.
     - The current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 6**: `[7, 1, 0]`
     - It is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.
     - The current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - **Test Case 7**: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - It is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.
     - The current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed decrement logic.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` is incorrect due to the flawed decrement logic.
   - The program as a whole is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required operation.

Correctness: **False**
