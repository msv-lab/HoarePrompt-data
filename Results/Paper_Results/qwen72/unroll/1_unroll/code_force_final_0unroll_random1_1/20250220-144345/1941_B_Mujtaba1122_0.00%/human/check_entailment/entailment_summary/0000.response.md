Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. 

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **func_1(list, n)**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its intended purpose.

2. **func_2(list, n)**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) and uses a `while` loop to apply the operation as long as the conditions \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \), \( \text{list}[i-1] > 0 \), and \( \text{list}[i+1] > 0 \) are met.
   - However, the operation is applied incorrectly. The code:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation subtracts the value of `list[i-1]` itself, which is not the intended operation. This will lead to incorrect results.

Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
