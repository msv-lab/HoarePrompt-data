Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop inside `func_2` is intended to perform the operation described in the problem, but it incorrectly modifies the elements of the list using `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is not consistent with the problem description. The correct operation should be to decrement `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, without using `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 5`, `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Actual Output: `NO`

The program will not correctly transform the array to all zeros in this case.
