Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that elements from index 0 to index n-2 are set to 0, while elements from index n-1 onwards remain unchanged. The function then evaluates `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program is that the list has been modified as described, and the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluation of `func_1`. **
