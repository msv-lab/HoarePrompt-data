### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the `func_2` function. The while loop inside `func_2` is intended to perform the operation described in the problem, but it incorrectly modifies the elements of the list. Specifically, the loop uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is not consistent with the problem description. The correct operation should be to decrement `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, without using `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Decrement Values:**
   - The line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[i - 1] = 0`, which is not the intended operation.
   - The line `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` is also incorrect because it subtracts `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, which can result in negative values or incorrect decrements.
   - The line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is similarly incorrect.

2. **Expected Operation:**
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

3. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input `n = 5`, `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`.
   - The expected output is `YES`, but the actual output will be `NO` due to the incorrect decrement values.
   - The program will not correctly transform the array to all zeros in this case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases due to the flawed logic in `func_2`. The incorrect decrement values in the while loop prevent the program from correctly applying the operation described in the problem.

Final: **False**
