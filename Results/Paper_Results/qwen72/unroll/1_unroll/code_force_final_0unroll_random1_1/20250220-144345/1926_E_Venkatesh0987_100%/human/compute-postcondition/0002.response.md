The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function is expected to return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**
