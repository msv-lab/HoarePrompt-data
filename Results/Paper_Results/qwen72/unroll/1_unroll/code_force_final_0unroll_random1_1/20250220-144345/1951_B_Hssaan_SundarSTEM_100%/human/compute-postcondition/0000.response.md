The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (t, n, k, and a) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
