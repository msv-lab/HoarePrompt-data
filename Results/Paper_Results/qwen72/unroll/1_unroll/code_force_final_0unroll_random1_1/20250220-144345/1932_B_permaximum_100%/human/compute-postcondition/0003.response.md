Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `results` is a list of t integers, where each integer is the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case.**
