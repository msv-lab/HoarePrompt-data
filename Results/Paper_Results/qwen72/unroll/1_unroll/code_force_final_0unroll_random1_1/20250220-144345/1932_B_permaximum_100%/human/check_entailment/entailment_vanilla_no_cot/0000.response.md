Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur for the first time, following the sequential rule described in the problem. The issue lies in the calculation of `next_year`. The program should find the next multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `current_year`, not just the next year that is a multiple of `ai`.

Here is the corrected part of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

In the original program, the line:
```python
if current_year % ai == 0:
    next_year = current_year + ai
else:
    next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```
is incorrect because it adds `ai` to `current_year` if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`. This does not follow the rule that the next sign must occur strictly after the current year. The corrected line:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```
ensures that the next year is always the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `current_year`.

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.
