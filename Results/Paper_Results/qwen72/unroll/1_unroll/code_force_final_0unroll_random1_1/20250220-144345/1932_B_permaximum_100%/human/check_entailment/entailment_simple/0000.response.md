Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and then calls a function `func_1` to compute the results. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case, and for each sign in the test case, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as described.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0, which is the starting year.
2. **Loop through signs**: For each sign `ai` in the list `a`:
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in the year `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is calculated using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
3. **Update current year**: `current_year` is updated to `next_year` after each sign.
4. **Store result**: After processing all signs for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.
5. **Return results**: The function returns the list of results, which contains the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is correct because it ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign, and it correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign based on the current year.

However, there is a small issue in the logic for calculating the next year:
- The condition `if current_year % ai == 0` is unnecessary because the calculation `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` will correctly handle the case where `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`.

The correct way to calculate the next year should be:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```
This will ensure that the next year is always the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

Given this, the program is almost correct, but the unnecessary condition can be removed to simplify the logic and ensure it is more robust.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    return results
```

Despite the unnecessary condition, the original program still produces the correct results for the given test cases. Therefore, the original program is correct in terms of functionality.

Correctness: **True**
