The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` lists, where each inner list contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case from the list `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` test cases, each containing a list of integers. It returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case.**
