Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Character Replacement Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
   - The program constructs a list of unique characters in `s` and sorts them. This is correct for building the auxiliary string `r`.
   - However, the program then replaces each character in `s` with the last unique character in `unique_chars` before the loop starts. This is incorrect because it does not follow the symmetric replacement rule described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s` and checks if it is in `unique_chars`.
   - If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces it with the last unique character in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`.
   - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character into `unique_chars` and increments both `i` and `j`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement. It also modifies `unique_chars` in a way that is not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**:
   - The function returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is not the decoded string `s`. Instead, it returns a sorted list of unique characters from `s`.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
- Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.
- Replace each character in `b` using this mapping to get the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))  # Construct the auxiliary string r
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}  # Create the symmetric mapping
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)  # Decode the string using the mapping
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected version will correctly decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
