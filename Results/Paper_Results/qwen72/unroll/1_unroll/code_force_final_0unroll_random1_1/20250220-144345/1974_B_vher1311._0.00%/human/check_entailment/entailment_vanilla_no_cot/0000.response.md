Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**:
   - The program attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with the corresponding character from the `unique_chars` list. However, it modifies the string `s` in place while iterating over it, which can lead to incorrect replacements and unexpected behavior.
   - The `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, which is not what is required. Each character should be replaced by its symmetric character in the `unique_chars` list, and this should be done in a single pass.

2. **Inserting Characters**:
   - The program incorrectly inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which is not part of the decoding algorithm. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the input string `s` in alphabetical order.

3. **Returning the Wrong String**:
   - The program returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is the auxiliary string `r` and not the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, you should:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the input string `b` in alphabetical order.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- Use this mapping to replace each character in `b` to get the original string `s`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Construct the Auxiliary String**:
   - `unique_chars = sorted(set(s))` creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the distinct characters of `s`.

2. **Create the Mapping**:
   - `mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}` creates a dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character.

3. **Decode the String**:
   - `decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)` uses the mapping to replace each character in `s` and constructs the decoded string.

This corrected program will correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement.
