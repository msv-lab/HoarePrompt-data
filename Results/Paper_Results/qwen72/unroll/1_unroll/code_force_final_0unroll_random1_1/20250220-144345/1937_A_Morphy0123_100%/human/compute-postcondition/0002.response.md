Output State: **The loop will execute `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` from the input, then print the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it will print 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it will print the next power of 2. The variable `power` will be reset to 1 at the start of each iteration, and the value of `n` will be updated to the result of `log2(n)` within each iteration. After all iterations, the loop will have no effect on any variables outside of its scope.**
