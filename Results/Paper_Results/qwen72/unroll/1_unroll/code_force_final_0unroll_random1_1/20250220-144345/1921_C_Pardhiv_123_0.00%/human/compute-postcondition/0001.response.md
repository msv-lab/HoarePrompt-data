The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user, and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already constrained to be at least 1, the loop can certainly execute at least once.

State: **t is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
