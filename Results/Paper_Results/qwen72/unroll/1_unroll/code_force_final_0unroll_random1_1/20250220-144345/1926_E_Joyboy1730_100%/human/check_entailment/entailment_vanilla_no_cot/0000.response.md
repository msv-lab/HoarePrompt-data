Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by first determining the number of cards that will be laid down in each step (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.) and then identifies the k-th card laid down. The logic correctly accounts for the reduction in the number of available cards at each step and the multiplication factor to determine the correct card value. The output for the given example matches the expected output, and the program handles the constraints as specified.
