Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list represents the neighbors of a node in an undirected graph. The length of each list in `u2vs` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, and the total number of elements across all lists is `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is the result of the `bfs` function with the input `a`. `previous` is a new list representing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes. `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value but is not used. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
