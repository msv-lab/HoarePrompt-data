Functionality: ** The function `func_4` takes no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is even but greater than the maximum possible value `max_k` (which is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even). Otherwise, it returns the input integers `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `k` is even. The function ensures that `max_k` is always greater than or equal to `k` when it returns `n` and `k`. **
