Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - The function checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. However, the problem does not specify that `k` must be even. It is possible for a permutation to have an odd Manhattan value.
   - The calculation of `max_k` is incorrect. The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `n * (n - 1)`, not `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` or `n ** 2 // 2`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function attempts to construct a permutation by swapping elements, but the logic is flawed. The loop `for i in range(n, -1, -2)` will not correctly handle the construction of the permutation, especially when `k` is not zero.
   - The function `func_3` is called with `c` and `l`, but the logic inside `func_3` is incorrect and does not ensure that the permutation is valid or that the Manhattan value is correctly adjusted.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function swaps elements in the list `l`, but the indices used in the swap are not guaranteed to be valid or to produce the correct Manhattan value.

4. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - The function calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`, but if `func_4` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and exits. This is not always the correct behavior because `k` can be odd and still have a valid permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Check if `k` is within the valid range for the given `n`.
- Construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value, if possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k > n * (n - 1):
        return "No"
    
    permutation = list(range(1, n + 1))
    i = 0
    while k > 0:
        if k >= 2 * (n - i - 1):
            permutation[i], permutation[n - 1] = permutation[n - 1], permutation[i]
            k -= 2 * (n - i - 1)
        else:
            permutation[i], permutation[i + k // 2] = permutation[i + k // 2], permutation[i]
            k = 0
        i += 1
    
    if k == 0:
        return "Yes", permutation
    else:
        return "No"

def solve_test_cases():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        result = find_permutation(n, k)
        if result == "No":
            print("No")
        else:
            print("Yes")
            print(" ".join(map(str, result[1])))

solve_test_cases()
```

This corrected program:
- Checks if `k` is within the valid range for the given `n`.
- Constructs a permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- Prints the result for each test case as required.
