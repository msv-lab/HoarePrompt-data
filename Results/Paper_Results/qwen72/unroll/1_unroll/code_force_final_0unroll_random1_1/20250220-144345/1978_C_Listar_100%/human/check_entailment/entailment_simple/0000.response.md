### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Constraints**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by calling `func_6()`.
   - `func_4()` is responsible for reading the input values `n` and `k`, checking if `k` is even, and if the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If these conditions are not met, it returns `(0, 0)` to indicate that no valid permutation exists.

2. **Manhattan Value Calculation**:
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated as:
     - If `n` is odd: \((n^2 - 1) // 2\)
     - If `n` is even: \(n^2 // 2\)
   - This calculation is correct because the maximum Manhattan value is achieved by reversing the permutation (i.e., \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\)).

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1(n, k)` constructs a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - The program starts with a list `l` containing the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - It iterates from the end of the list, swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value by the required amount.
   - The loop ensures that the Manhattan value is increased in steps of 2 (since each swap increases the value by 2).

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - `func_3(c, l)` swaps elements at indices `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - `func_2(c, k, l)` performs a more specific swap to fine-tune the Manhattan value when the remaining `k` is less than the current step size.

5. **Output**:
   - `func_5(l)` prints the permutation if it exists.
   - If no valid permutation exists, `func_6()` prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Functions:

- **`func_4()`**:
  - It correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
  - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n`.

- **`func_1(n, k)`**:
  - It correctly initializes the permutation `l` and iterates to increase the Manhattan value.
  - The loop ensures that the value is increased in steps of 2, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
  - The function calls `func_2(c, k, l)` when the remaining `k` is less than the current step size, which is a valid approach to achieve the exact required Manhattan value.

- **`func_2(c, k, l)`**:
  - This function performs a specific swap to adjust the Manhattan value by the exact remaining `k`.
  - The indices used for the swap are correct and ensure that the permutation remains valid.

- **`func_3(c, l)`**:
  - This function performs a swap to increase the Manhattan value by 2.
  - The indices used for the swap are correct and ensure that the permutation remains valid.

- **`func_5(l)`**:
  - It correctly prints the permutation in the required format.

- **`func_6()`**:
  - It correctly processes the input and calls the appropriate functions to determine if a valid permutation exists and to print it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input constraints, calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value, and constructs a valid permutation if one exists. The logic and steps taken are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
