The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, and `n` is currently set to 0. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
