You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (each integer n in the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and a list of pairs of strings (each string consists of exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())

        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`. After processing, it will print 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it will print 'Yes'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be consumed and no longer available after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves left, right, up, or down every second, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
   - It then iterates over the columns in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1 in Python, since indices are 0-based).

3. **Key Logic:**
   - The program checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can reach the target cell.
   - Specifically, it checks if there is a column `i` such that:
     - The robot is in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i+1` points left (`<`), and the arrow in the second row at column `i-1` points left (`<`).
     - Or, the robot is in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the first row at column `i+1` points left (`<`), and the arrow in the first row at column `i-1` points left (`<`).

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If either of these conditions is met, the robot will get stuck in a loop and cannot reach the target cell (2, n).
   - If the loop completes without finding such a condition, the robot can reach the target cell.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "No" if the robot gets stuck.
   - It prints "yes" if the robot can reach the target cell.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` and `print('yes')` which should be consistent with the problem's requirement for "YES" and "NO".
   - The program does not handle the case where `i + 1` is out of bounds, which can happen if `i` is the last column.

7. **Correcting the Output:**
   - The output should be "YES" and "NO" instead of "yes" and "No".

8. **Correcting the Bound Check:**
   - The condition `if i + 1 < n` should be adjusted to ensure that `i + 1` does not go out of bounds.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a minor issue with the output case sensitivity and a potential out-of-bounds error.
- After correcting these issues, the program should correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False** (due to the output case sensitivity and potential out-of-bounds error).
