The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `pairs_of_strings`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a list of integers, where each integer n in the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, representing the lengths of the strings in the pairs.
- `pairs_of_strings` is a list of pairs of strings, where each string consists of exactly n characters, and each character is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the two strings in the pair can be made identical by flipping any number of arrows (i.e., changing '<' to '>' or vice versa) such that no two arrows point to each other after the flips. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (a list of even integers where each n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `pairs_of_strings` (a list of pairs of strings, each string consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'). The function returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the two strings in the pair can be made identical by flipping arrows such that no two arrows point to each other, or "No" otherwise.**
