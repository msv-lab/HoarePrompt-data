#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (each integer n in the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and a list of pairs of strings (each string consists of exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`. After processing, it will print 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it will print 'Yes'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be consumed and no longer available after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads `t` test cases from the input, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' or '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in `a` and `b` do not form a pair of arrows pointing to each other. If such a pair is found, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function consumes the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and no longer retains them.
