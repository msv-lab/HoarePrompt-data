Output State: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (each integer n in the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and a list of pairs of strings (each string consists of exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
