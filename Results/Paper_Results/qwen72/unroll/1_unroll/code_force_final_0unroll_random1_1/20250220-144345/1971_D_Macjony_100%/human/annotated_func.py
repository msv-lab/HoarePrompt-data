#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `count` for each binary string `s` input, where `count` is the number of transitions in the string (i.e., the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0') minus one if a '0' is followed by a '1' at least once. The variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will be in their final states after the loop completes, but the exact values of `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will depend on the last input string processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates the number of transitions in the string (i.e., the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0') and prints this count. If the string contains at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count before printing. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
