The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `s`, a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.

However, the provided function signature does not include the parameters `t` and `s`. Assuming the function is intended to handle these parameters, the correct signature should be:

```python
def func(t, s):
```

Given this, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `s`, a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500). For each test case, it processes the binary string `s` and returns the result for each case.**
