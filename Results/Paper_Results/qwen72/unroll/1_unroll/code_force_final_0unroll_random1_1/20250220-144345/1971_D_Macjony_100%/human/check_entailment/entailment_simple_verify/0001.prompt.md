You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `count` for each binary string `s` input, where `count` is the number of transitions in the string (i.e., the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0') minus one if a '0' is followed by a '1' at least once. The variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will be in their final states after the loop completes, but the exact values of `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will depend on the last input string processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) into which a binary string can be cut so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to check if a transition from '0' to '1' has been encountered.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop, checking for transitions between characters.
   - If a transition is found (i.e., `s[j] != s[j + 1]`), it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `count`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies transitions between characters in the string.
   - It counts the number of transitions, which is a good start.
   - However, the logic for adjusting the count based on the `flag` is not entirely correct. The `count` should be adjusted based on the number of '1's that appear before '0's, not just the presence of a single '0' to '1' transition.
   - The correct approach is to count the number of '1's that appear before the first '0' and add 1 to this count (since the entire string can be considered as one piece if there are no such '1's).

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the string "11010":
     - There are two '1's before the first '0', so the minimum number of pieces is 3.
   - For the string "00000000":
     - The string is already sorted, so the minimum number of pieces is 1.
   - For the string "1":
     - The string is already sorted, so the minimum number of pieces is 1.
   - For the string "10":
     - There is one '1' before the first '0', so the minimum number of pieces is 2.
   - For the string "0001111":
     - The string is already sorted, so the minimum number of pieces is 1.
   - For the string "0110":
     - There is one '1' before the first '0', so the minimum number of pieces is 2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple '1's before the first '0'. It only checks for a single transition and adjusts the count based on that, which is not sufficient.
