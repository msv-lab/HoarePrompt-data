Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment to find and output a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, given a sequence of integers `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` which is a permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can ask at most 3n queries to determine the comparison results based on the bitwise OR of selected indices. It handles up to 10^3 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. After the function concludes, it has output a pair of indices `(k, best)` for each test case, where `k` and `best` are the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements in the permutation. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `k` and `best` are updated to the indices that maximize the XOR for each test case. **
