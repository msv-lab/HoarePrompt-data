Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the results of the loop calculations, and the outputs for each query are printed.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is the number of test cases and remains unchanged after the loop.
- The variable `n` is the number of cities for each test case and is reset for each new test case.
- The list `a` contains the positions of the cities and is reset for each new test case.
- The list `queries` contains the pairs of cities for which the distance needs to be calculated and is reset for each new test case.
- The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative distances calculated from the left and right, respectively, for each city.
- For each query, the difference in distances is calculated and printed, but the actual values of `d1` and `d2` are not changed after the loop completes for each test case.
