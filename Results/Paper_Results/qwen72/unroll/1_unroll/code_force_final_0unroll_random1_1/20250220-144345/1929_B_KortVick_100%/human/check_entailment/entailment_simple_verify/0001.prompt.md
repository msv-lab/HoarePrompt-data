You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided in each iteration of the loop, but `t` remains unchanged. The loop prints a value for each iteration, but does not modify `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid can contribute to at most 4 diagonals (2 main and 2 anti-diagonals).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals each colored cell can cover.

3. **Solution Strategy:**
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can color cells along the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal to cover \( k \) diagonals. Each cell on these diagonals covers 2 diagonals.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to color additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals. Each additional cell will cover 2 diagonals, but we need to account for the overlap.

4. **Special Case:**
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color all cells on both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, plus one additional cell to cover the last diagonal. This requires \( 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \) cells, but the program uses \( k // 2 + 1 \), which is incorrect.

5. **General Case:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - For \( k > 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the general case where \( k \leq 2n - 1 \) by using \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - However, for the special case where \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program outputs \( k // 2 + 1 \), which is incorrect. It should output \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the special case \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
