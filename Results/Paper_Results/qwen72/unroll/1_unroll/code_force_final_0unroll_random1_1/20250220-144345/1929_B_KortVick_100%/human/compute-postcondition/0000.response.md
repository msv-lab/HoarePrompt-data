The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the precondition for `n` and `k` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), `t` is an input integer.**
