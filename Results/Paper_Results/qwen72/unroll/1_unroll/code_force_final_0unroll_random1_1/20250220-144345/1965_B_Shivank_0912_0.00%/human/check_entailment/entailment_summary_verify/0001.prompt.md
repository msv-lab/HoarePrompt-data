You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [2 ** i for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(25, sequence)`. The `sequence` list contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases, each containing a pair of integers (n, k). This is done using `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input into a list of strings, then converting the relevant parts to integers and storing them in a list of tuples.

2. **Sequence Generation**: The program generates a sequence of 25 elements, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** i` for `i` in the range 0 to 24). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.

3. **Sequence Properties**:
   - **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The sequence generated is a set of distinct powers of 2. The sum of any subsequence of distinct powers of 2 is unique and can be represented as a binary number. Therefore, it is impossible to form a subsequence that sums to any specific value `k` unless `k` is one of the sums of the subsequences of the sequence.
   - **All Other Sums**: The sequence can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\) (which is 33,554,431) by selecting appropriate elements. Since \(n \le 10^6\), the sequence can certainly form any sum from 1 to \(n\) except for `k`.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the size of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case. This is consistent with the problem requirements, as the sequence meets the conditions for all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will not have a subsequence that sums to 2, but it will have a subsequence that sums to 1.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 1, but it will have subsequences that sum to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 8, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 3, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 7, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in generating a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all test cases.
