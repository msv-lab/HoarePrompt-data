Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and (1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). `sequence` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**
