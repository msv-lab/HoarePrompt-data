You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take parameters t, n, q, and a list of integers a, and a list of queries. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and q are integers where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, and each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: `idx` is `2 * (t + q * t)`, `results` is a list containing `t * q + t` strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by an empty string for each test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [t * q + t lines of either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by an empty string]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of queries. For each query (l, r), it returns a result based on the elements in the list `a` within the range (l, r). If the sum of `n` over all test cases or the sum of `q` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^5, the function's behavior is undefined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
