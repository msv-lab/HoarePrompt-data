### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for the problem description. However, it reads the inputs correctly within the function using `input()`.
   - The function processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` correctly.
   - It reads the list of chosen vertices `a` and adjusts the indices by subtracting 1 (to make them 0-based).

3. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`, which is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form `x - 2` triangles if they are all connected.

4. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The function checks if adding a vertex between two chosen vertices can form additional triangles. This is done by checking if the next vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in the set `st` and the vertex after that `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in the set `st`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between the chosen vertices and categorizes them into `odd` and `even` lists based on whether the gap is odd or even.
   - The gaps are sorted to ensure that the smallest gaps are filled first, which is a good strategy to maximize the number of triangles.

6. **Filling Gaps:**
   - The function iterates over the `odd` and `even` gaps, attempting to fill them with additional vertices up to the limit `y`.
   - If `y` is not sufficient to fill a gap, it adds as many vertices as possible and breaks out of the loop.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:** The function should be defined with parameters to match the problem description, but this is a minor issue since the inputs are read correctly within the function.
- **Initial Triangle Count:** The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`, which is correct but could be more clearly explained.
- **Gap Calculation and Filling:** The logic for calculating and filling gaps is correct, but the way it handles the gaps (especially the even gaps) could be more efficient and clear.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the inputs, processes the gaps, and calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The only minor issue is the function definition, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**
