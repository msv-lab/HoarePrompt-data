Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will be printed for each test case. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` will remain unchanged for each test case, but their values will be re-assigned in each iteration based on the input. The lists `odd` and `even` will be populated and sorted based on the gaps between the chosen vertices, and `y` will be decremented as vertices are chosen to fill the gaps. The final value of `ans` for each test case will be the number of vertices that can be chosen, including Bessie's chosen vertices and the additional vertices chosen to fill the gaps, up to the limit of `y`.**
