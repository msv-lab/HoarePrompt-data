The function `max_triangles` accepts five parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon.
- `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.
- `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen and the additional vertices you can choose, given the constraints of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`.
