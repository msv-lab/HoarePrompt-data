Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of 2n integers.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list of integers `l` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest integers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program initializes a variable `score` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list `l` in steps of 2, adding the smallest integer of each pair to the score. This is because the smallest integer in each pair will always be the minimum value when taking pairs from a sorted list.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the score by adding the minimum of each chosen pair. By sorting the list and always taking the smallest integer in each pair, the program ensures that the sum of the smallest n integers is maximized, which is the optimal strategy.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: it can handle up to 5000 test cases, and for each test case, it can handle up to 100 integers (since \( n \leq 50 \) and there are 2n integers).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and produces the correct output for the given constraints and inputs.

Correctness: **True**
