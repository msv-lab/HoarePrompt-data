Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer.
   - This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, which is the optimal strategy because it minimizes the loss of larger values.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - This is because the sorted list will pair the smallest elements together, and the minimum of each pair will be the first element in the pair.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - It reads the list of 2n integers and sorts them.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element and adding it to the score.
   - The logic of taking every second element from the sorted list ensures that we are always adding the minimum of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
