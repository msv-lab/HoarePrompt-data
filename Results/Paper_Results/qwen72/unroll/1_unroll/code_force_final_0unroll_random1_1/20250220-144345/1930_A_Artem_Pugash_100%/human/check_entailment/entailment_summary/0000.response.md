Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. The program sorts the list of integers and then iterates through the sorted list, adding every second element (starting from the first element) to the score. This approach ensures that the program always selects the smaller of the two numbers in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

Hereâ€™s why this approach is correct:
1. **Sorting the List**: By sorting the list, the smallest elements are placed at the beginning. This ensures that when we select pairs, we are always selecting the smallest available number as the minimum of the pair.
2. **Iterating in Steps of 2**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element. This effectively pairs the smallest elements together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is added to the score.
3. **Maximizing the Score**: Since the smallest elements are always chosen first, the sum of the smallest n elements is the maximum possible score. This is because the smallest elements will be the ones contributing to the score, and the larger elements will be discarded.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
