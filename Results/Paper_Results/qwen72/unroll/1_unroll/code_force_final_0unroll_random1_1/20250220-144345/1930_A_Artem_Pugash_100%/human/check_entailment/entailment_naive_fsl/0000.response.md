Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score by selecting the minimum of each pair of integers from the sorted list. Here's why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first when forming pairs.

2. **Pair Selection**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element. For each pair, it adds the first element (which is the smaller one in the sorted list) to the score. This is optimal because the smallest number in each pair will always be the minimum, and by selecting the smallest numbers first, we maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Correct Output**: The program correctly prints the score for each test case, and it handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

Let's verify a few edge cases:

- **Single Test Case with n=1**: 
  - Input: `1\n2 3`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Correct.

- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - Input: `3\n1\n2 3\n2\n1 1 2 1\n3\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted Lists: `[2, 3]`, `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Scores: `2`, `2`, `3`
  - Output: `2\n2\n3`
  - Correct.

- **Larger n**:
  - Input: `1\n4\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Score: `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16`
  - Output: `16`
  - Correct.

- **All Elements are the Same**:
  - Input: `1\n4\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Output: `4`
  - Correct.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and there are no evident edge cases or logical flaws, the program is correct.
