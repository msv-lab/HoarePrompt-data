Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers. Sorting is crucial because it ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first, which maximizes the minimum values chosen in each move.

3. **Scoring**: The program initializes the score to 0. It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair (i.e., the smaller of the two numbers) to the score. This is done by the loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` and the line `score += l[i]`.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the final score.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved by always selecting the smallest number from the remaining pairs, which is the optimal strategy for this problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
