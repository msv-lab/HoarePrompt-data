Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then calculates the sum of the smallest n integers from the list and prints this sum. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated sum for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are no longer relevant, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output. **
