You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: The loop processes all test cases and prints the results for each query. The variables t, n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, v, and m are modified within the loop for each test case, but their final values are not retained between test cases. After all iterations, t is 0 (as all test cases have been processed), and the lists a, b, ad, bd, and v are reset to their initial states for each new test case. The variable m is reset to 0 for each query within a test case. The final output state is the same as the initial state, except that all test cases and queries have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, and two strictly increasing sequences of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it reads the sequences `a` and `b`, and for each query `d` (where `0 ≤ d ≤ n`), it computes and prints the corresponding value from `b` or an interpolated value based on the sequences `a` and `b`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. The final state of the program is such that all test cases and queries have been processed, and the results have been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the positions and the corresponding times of the car at those positions.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the beginning to handle the starting point.
   - It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` to get the distances `ad` and the time differences `bd`.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment by dividing the corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, it prints `b[s]` directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the distance `a[s-1]` from `ql` to get the remaining distance within the segment.
     - Adding the time `b[s-1]` already traveled to the time calculated for the remaining distance using the speed `v[s]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `bisect_left` Usage:**
  - `bisect_left(a, ql)` correctly finds the index `s` such that `a[s]` is the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. This is crucial for determining the segment in which `ql` lies.

- **Handling Exact Matches:**
  - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, the program correctly prints `b[s]`.

- **Calculating Time for Non-Exact Matches:**
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining distance within the segment by subtracting `a[s-1]` from `ql`.
  - It then adds the time `b[s-1]` already traveled to the time calculated for the remaining distance using the speed `v[s]`.
  - The time calculation is done using the formula `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, which is correct for the constant speed assumption.

- **Rounding Down:**
  - The program uses `int(m)` to round down the time to the nearest integer, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the input, processes the queries, and outputs the results as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
