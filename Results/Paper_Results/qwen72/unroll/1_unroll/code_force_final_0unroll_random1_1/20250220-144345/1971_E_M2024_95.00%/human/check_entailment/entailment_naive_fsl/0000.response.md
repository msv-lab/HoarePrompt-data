Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `ql` is exactly at a point `a[s]` correctly. Specifically, the line `if a[s] == ql:` should be `if a[s] == ql + a[s-1]:` because `bisect_left` returns the position where `ql` should be inserted to keep the list sorted, and it might return an index where the value is not exactly `ql` but the next higher value. This can lead to incorrect results for queries that are exactly at the known points.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
1
10 2 4
4 10
3 7
6
4
2
7

Expected Output:
5 3 2 5

Actual Output:
5 4 2 5
```

In this example, the query `4` should return `3` because the car reaches point `4` at minute `3`, but the program incorrectly returns `4`.
