The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, and two strictly increasing sequences of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it reads the sequences `a` and `b`, and for each query `d` (where `0 ≤ d ≤ n`), it computes and prints the corresponding value from `b` or an interpolated value based on the sequences `a` and `b`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. The final state of the program is such that all test cases and queries have been processed, and the results have been printed to the console.
