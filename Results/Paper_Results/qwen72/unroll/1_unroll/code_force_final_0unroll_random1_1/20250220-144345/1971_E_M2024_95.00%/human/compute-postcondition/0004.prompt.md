You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5. The lists a and b are strictly increasing sequences of integers, with a_i and b_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and a_k = n. Each query d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ad = [0]
        
        bd = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        
        print()
        
    #State: The loop processes all test cases and prints the results for each query. The variables t, n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, v, and m are modified within the loop for each test case, but their final values are not retained between test cases. After all iterations, t is 0 (as all test cases have been processed), and the lists a, b, ad, bd, and v are reset to their initial states for each new test case. The variable m is reset to 0 for each query within a test case. The final output state is the same as the initial state, except that all test cases and queries have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d`. It returns a list of results for each query `d` in each test case, where the results are determined based on the sequences `a` and `b`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
