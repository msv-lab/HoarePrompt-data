Output State: **The loop processes all test cases and prints the results for each query. The variables t, n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, v, and m are modified within the loop for each test case, but their final values are not retained between test cases. After all iterations, t is 0 (as all test cases have been processed), and the lists a, b, ad, bd, and v are reset to their initial states for each new test case. The variable m is reset to 0 for each query within a test case. The final output state is the same as the initial state, except that all test cases and queries have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.**
