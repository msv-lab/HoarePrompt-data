### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which are the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.

2. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - The lists `a` and `b` are initialized with an extra element at the beginning (0), which is a good practice to handle the starting point (0, 0) without additional checks.
   - `ad` and `bd` are initialized to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Calculating Differences**:
   - The program correctly calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd`.

4. **Calculating Speeds**:
   - The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment between consecutive points. This is done by dividing the distance difference `ad[i]` by the time difference `bd[i]`.

5. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, it prints `b[s]` directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the distance to the previous known point `a[s-1]` from `ql`.
     - Adding the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]`.
     - Adding the time taken to travel the remaining distance `ql - a[s-1]` at the speed `v[s]`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each query, ensuring that the time is rounded down to the nearest integer using `int(m)`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- It correctly calculates the time taken to reach each query point by considering the constant speed between known points.
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient query processing, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
