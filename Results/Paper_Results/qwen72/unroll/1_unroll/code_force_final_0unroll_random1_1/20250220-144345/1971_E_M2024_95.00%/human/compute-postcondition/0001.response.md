The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer input by the user and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the given constraints for `t` already ensure that the loop will run at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
