You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, `to_int` is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers, `line` is the input string. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the substrings in `items`. `items` is a list of substrings split from the input string `line` by spaces, as `space` is true and `to_int` is true.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of characters from the input string `line`, since `space` is false and `to_int` is false.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true and `to_int` is true, it returns a list of integers split from the input string `line` by spaces. If `space` is false and `to_int` is false, it returns a list of characters from the input string `line`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers converted from the substrings in `items`. `items` is a list of substrings split from the input string `line` by spaces, as `space` is true and `to_int` is true.

Case_2: The program returns a list of characters from the input string `line`, since `space` is false and `to_int` is false.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
