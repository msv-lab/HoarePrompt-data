The only variables in the loop head are `index` and `substring`. The loop will execute if `index` is not equal to `-1`. Given the state right before the loop, `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or `-1` if `substring` is not found. For the loop to execute, `index` must be a valid position in `string`, which means `substring` must be found in `string`.

Therefore, to ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, `index` must be a valid position (i.e., not `-1`).

State: **string is a string, substring is a non-empty string, indices is an empty list, index is the position of the first occurrence of substring in string and is not -1**
