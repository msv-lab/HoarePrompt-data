You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The function `func` will have processed all test cases. For each test case, it will have computed and printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values will not be relevant to the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray contains all the same elements greater than 1. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

The subarray `c[1:3]` is `[2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem, this subarray should be considered good because we can construct an array `b` such that:

- The sum of elements in `b` is the same as the sum of elements in `c[1:3]` (i.e., 6).
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[1:3]`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

One possible `b` could be `[1, 2, 3]`, which satisfies all the conditions. However, the program will output `NO` for this case because it incorrectly assumes that the subarray is not good if it contains the same elements.

The issue lies in the condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good, especially when all elements in the subarray are the same and greater than 1.
