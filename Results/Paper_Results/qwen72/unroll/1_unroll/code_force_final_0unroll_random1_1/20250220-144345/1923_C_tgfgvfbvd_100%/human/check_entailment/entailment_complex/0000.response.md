### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It reads the array `l` of length `n` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.
   - Both arrays are initialized with a 0 at the start to handle the prefix sum and count calculations correctly.

3. **Subarray Calculation:**
   - For each query, the function reads the start and end indices `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the count of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix count array `c`.

4. **Good Subarray Condition:**
   - The function checks if the subarray length `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The sum of the subarray `s` should be equal to the sum of the array `b` of the same length. This is implicitly checked by the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.
- **Condition 2:** No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`. This is ensured by the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` because if the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus the length is greater than or equal to the count of 1s, it means there is enough "slack" to change each element to a different positive integer.
- **Condition 3:** All elements in `b` should be greater than 0. This is inherently satisfied by the problem constraints and the way the conditions are checked.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Subarray:** The function correctly handles this by checking `b - a + 1 > 1`. If the subarray has only one element, it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be changed to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.
- **Subarray with No 1s:** The function correctly handles this by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the length is non-negative, which is always true for subarrays with no 1s.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.
