You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]

                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The function `func` will have processed all test cases. For each test case, it will have computed and printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values will not be relevant to the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.
   - It initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c` with a starting value of 0.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.
   - For each element `x` in `l`:
     - If `x` is 1, it increments the count `j` of 1s.
     - It adds `x` to the running sum `i`.
     - It appends the current sum `i` to `p`.
     - It appends the current count `j` of 1s to `c`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[a-1:b]` using the prefix count array `c`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It checks if the subarray is good based on the following conditions:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` must be greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray `s` minus the length of the subarray `b - a + 1` must be greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray `i`.

4. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - The subarray is good if there exists an array `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray `l[a-1:b]`.
     - Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray `l[a-1:b]`.
     - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.
   - The program's condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray `s` is large enough to allow for a different array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `l[a-1:b]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1, as it will always print `NO` in this case.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray contains only 1s, as the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` will not be satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses prefix sum arrays to handle the queries and ensures that the conditions for a good subarray are met.

### Correctness:
**True**
