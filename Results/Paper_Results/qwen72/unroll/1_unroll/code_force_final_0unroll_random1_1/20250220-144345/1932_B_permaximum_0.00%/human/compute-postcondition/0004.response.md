Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It calculates the smallest non-zero multiple of each element in `a` and sums these values to produce a result `year`. The function prints `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their values from the last iteration, and the function does not return any value. **
