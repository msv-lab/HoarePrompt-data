The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder that is typically used when the loop variable is not needed in the loop body. Before the loop starts, the variable `_` is not initialized, and it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and `_` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
