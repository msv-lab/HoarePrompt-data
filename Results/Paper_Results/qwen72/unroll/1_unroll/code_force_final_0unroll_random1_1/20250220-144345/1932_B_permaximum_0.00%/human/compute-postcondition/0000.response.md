Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**
