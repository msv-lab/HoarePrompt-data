### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - The initial state of `A` is set to `False`, which means the function assumes Bob is the winner unless proven otherwise.
   - The function checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If it is not 1, Alice can remove all stones from all piles in her first move, making her the winner. This is correct because Alice can always choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size, and if the smallest pile size is greater than 1, she can empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the function proceeds to check if the unique pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - The function creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes `set_`.
   - It iterates through this list to check if the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If it finds a difference greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If `not_c` is `True` after the loop, it means all unique pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1. In this case, the function toggles `A` to `False` again, indicating Bob wins.
   - If `not_c` is `False`, it means there is at least one gap between the unique pile sizes, and the function toggles `A` to `True`, indicating Alice wins.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the unique pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the unique pile sizes are not consecutive integers starting from 1.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic of the function aligns with the optimal strategy for both players. If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1 and the unique pile sizes are consecutive, Bob can always win by forcing Alice into a losing position.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1 and the unique pile sizes are not consecutive, Alice can always win by making a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
