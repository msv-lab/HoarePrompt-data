Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; the first element of `arr` is 1; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`. If `not_c` is True, `A` is False and `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `A` remains True and `not_c` remains False.***
