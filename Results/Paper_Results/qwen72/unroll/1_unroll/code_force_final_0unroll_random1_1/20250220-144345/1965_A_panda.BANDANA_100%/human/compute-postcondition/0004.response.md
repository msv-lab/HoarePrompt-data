The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input, where each input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function processes this input and outputs the result to standard output.
