You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers n and m, and a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the colors of the grid. n and m are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of elements in all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `m` from input, followed by `n` lines of strings each of length `m`. After processing, it will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible` will be reset for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged, and the list `gr` will be empty.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a value based on the input grid, but the exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
