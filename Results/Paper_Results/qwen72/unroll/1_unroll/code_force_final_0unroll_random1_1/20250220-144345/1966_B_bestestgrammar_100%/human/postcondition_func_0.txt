The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It then checks if the grid can be transformed into a valid configuration where the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, and if the entire first row, last row, first column, and last column are uniform in color. If the grid meets these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function performs this check for each of the `t` test cases and prints the result for each case. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `gr` is reset to empty for each iteration.
