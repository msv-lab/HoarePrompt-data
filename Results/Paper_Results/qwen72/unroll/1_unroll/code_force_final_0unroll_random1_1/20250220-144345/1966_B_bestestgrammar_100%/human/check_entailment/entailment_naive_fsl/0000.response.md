Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly determines that a grid can be made uniform (all squares the same color) if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and the entire top and bottom rows or the entire left and right columns are uniform. However, this is not always sufficient to ensure that the entire grid can be made uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
3 3
W B W
B B B
W B W
```
In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are both 'W', and the entire top and bottom rows are uniform. However, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform with the given operations. The program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case.
