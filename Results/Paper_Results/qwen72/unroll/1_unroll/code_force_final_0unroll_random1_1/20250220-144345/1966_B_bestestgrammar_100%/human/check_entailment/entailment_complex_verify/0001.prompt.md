You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `m` from input, followed by `n` lines of strings each of length `m`. After processing, it will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible` will be reset for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged, and the list `gr` will be empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It then checks if the grid can be transformed into a valid configuration where the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, and if the entire first row, last row, first column, and last column are uniform in color. If the grid meets these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function performs this check for each of the `t` test cases and prints the result for each case. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `gr` is reset to empty for each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times m \) grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares.
   - We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using any number of operations.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the grid is already all one color, the answer is "YES".
   - If the grid has a mix of colors, we need to check if it is possible to make all squares the same color.
   - The operations can only affect squares that are within the subrectangle defined by the selected squares. Therefore, if there is a single square that is different from the rest, it will be impossible to make all squares the same color.

3. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the answer as "YES".
   - It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors.
   - If they are different, it further checks if all squares in the first row and the last row are the same color, and if all squares in the first column and the last column are the same color.
   - If any of these checks fail, it sets the answer to "NO".

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color unless all squares in the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, are the same color.
   - However, the program does not check if the entire grid can be made the same color if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color. This is a critical oversight because even if the corners are the same, the grid might still have a mix of colors that cannot be unified.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first example, the grid is:
     ```
     W
     B
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
   - For the second example, the grid is:
     ```
     WWWWBW
     WBWWWW
     BBBWWW
     BWWWBB
     WWBWBB
     BBBWBW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the third example, the grid is:
     ```
     W
     ```
     The grid is already all one color, and the program correctly outputs "YES".
   - For the fourth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     ```
     The grid is already all one color, and the program correctly outputs "YES".
   - For the fifth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BWBW
     WBWB
     BWBW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the sixth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     WW
     WW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
   - For the seventh example, the grid is:
     ```
     WWBW
     BBWB
     WWBB
     BBBB
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the eighth example, the grid is:
     ```
     WBBWB
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully check if the entire grid can be made the same color. It only checks the corners and the first and last rows/columns, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
