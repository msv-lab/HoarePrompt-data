Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Construction of `r`**: The function `func_1` constructs the string `r` by first creating a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`, then sorting these characters. This correctly generates a string `r` that contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.

3. **Mapping Construction**: The program creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. This is done by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping the i-th character to the (-i-1)-th character. This step is crucial for the decoding process and is implemented correctly.

4. **Decoding**: The program then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in the `mapping` dictionary. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method, which constructs the decoded string.

5. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected in the `results` list and printed at the end, each on a new line. This matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the steps taken by the program, the logic and implementation are correct. The program should correctly decode the encoded strings as described.

Correctness: **True**
