Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order of the unique characters in `encoded`, based on a mapping dictionary. The unique characters in `encoded` are first sorted and then mapped to their reverse positions. The final state of the program is that the original `encoded` string is transformed into a new string according to this mapping. **
