### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative: \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - For Alice to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be non-zero.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be paired up such that each pair has a zero XOR.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Each number \( x \) can be paired with another \( x \) to make the XOR zero.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from each count \( p_i \) is \( \lfloor p_i / 2 \rfloor \).

6. **Special Case:**
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal, removing one of each will make the XOR zero. This is because the XOR of three odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s will be zero, and removing one of each will leave an even count, which can be paired to zero.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal, and if so, increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the special case where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal.
   - The program correctly counts the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from each count.
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
