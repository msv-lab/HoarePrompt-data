Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win the game by removing numbers optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the bitwise XOR operation and how it affects the sequence of numbers.

### Key Points:
1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence is even. This is because:
   - 1 XOR 1 = 0
   - 2 XOR 2 = 0
   - 3 XOR 3 = 0
   - 4 XOR 4 = 0
   - 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 0 (since 1 XOR 2 = 3, 3 XOR 3 = 0, 0 XOR 4 = 4, and 4 XOR 4 = 0)

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing a number from the sequence can change the XOR from zero to non-zero or from non-zero to zero.

### Program Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Counting Wins**:
  - The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
  - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1. This is because if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, the XOR of these numbers is 3, and removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero.
  - For each count `x` in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. This is because removing pairs of the same number will not change the XOR (since `x XOR x = 0`), and each pair can be removed without affecting the winning condition.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 1 1 0`
  - Counts: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
  - `cnt` is incremented by 1 because the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd.
  - `cnt` is then incremented by `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0`.
  - Total `cnt` = 1, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `1 0 1 2`
  - Counts: 1 (1s), 0 (2s), 1 (3s), 2 (4s)
  - `cnt` is not incremented by 1 because the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not equal.
  - `cnt` is then incremented by `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 1`.
  - Total `cnt` = 1, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `2 2 2 0`
  - Counts: 2 (1s), 2 (2s), 2 (3s), 0 (4s)
  - `cnt` is not incremented by 1 because the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not odd.
  - `cnt` is then incremented by `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`.
  - Total `cnt` = 3, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4**: `3 3 2 0`
  - Counts: 3 (1s), 3 (2s), 2 (3s), 0 (4s)
  - `cnt` is incremented by 1 because the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd.
  - `cnt` is then incremented by `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 2`.
  - Total `cnt` = 3, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 5**: `0 9 9 9`
  - Counts: 0 (1s), 9 (2s), 9 (3s), 9 (4s)
  - `cnt` is not incremented by 1 because the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not equal.
  - `cnt` is then incremented by `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 12`.
  - Total `cnt` = 12, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The logic and the examples provided are consistent with the expected output.
