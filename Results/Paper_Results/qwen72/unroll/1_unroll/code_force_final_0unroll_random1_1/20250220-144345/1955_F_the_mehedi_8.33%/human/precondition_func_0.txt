The function takes no input arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
