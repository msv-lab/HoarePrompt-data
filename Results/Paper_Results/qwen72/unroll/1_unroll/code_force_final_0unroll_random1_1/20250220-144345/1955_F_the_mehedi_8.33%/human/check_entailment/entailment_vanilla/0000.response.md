### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The game is played by Alice and Bob, and the winner is determined by the bitwise XOR of the sequence.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR is non-zero.

3. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can remove pairs of numbers that cancel each other out in the XOR operation.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each number \( x \) in the sequence, the number of pairs that can be formed is \( \lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor \).
   - This is because each pair of the same number will result in a zero XOR.

6. **Special Case:**
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal and odd, removing one of these numbers will still leave the XOR non-zero. Therefore, Bob wins once in this special case.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal and odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the number of pairs that can be formed for each count to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the special case where the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal and odd.
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs for each count and adds them to the counter.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

**Correctness: True**
