#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the variable `cnt` has been calculated and printed. The value of `cnt` for each test case is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. The input variables and the loop control variable `_` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The input variables and the loop control variable `_` are no longer relevant after the function concludes.
