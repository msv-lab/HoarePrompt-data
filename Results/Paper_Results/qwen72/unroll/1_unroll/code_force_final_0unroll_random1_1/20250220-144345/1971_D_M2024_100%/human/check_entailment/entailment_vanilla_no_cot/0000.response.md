Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. The logic in the program is flawed in the following way:

1. **Counting Cuts**:
   - The program counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`).
   - However, the logic for determining the number of pieces is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if cut0 == 0:` is not the right criterion to determine the number of pieces.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach is to count the number of '1's that appear before any '0' in the string. This is because each such '1' will need to be in a separate piece to be moved to the end of the sorted string.
   - The minimum number of pieces required is the number of such '1's plus one (for the remaining part of the string).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == '1':
                cut += 1
            if a[i] == '0':
                break
        if cut == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(cut)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Counting '1's Before the First '0'**:
  - The program iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's that appear before the first '0'.
  - If there are no '1's before the first '0', the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.
  - Otherwise, the number of pieces required is the count of such '1's plus one.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `11010`, the correct output is `3` because the string can be split into `11`, `0`, and `10`.
- For the input `00000000`, the correct output is `1` because the string is already sorted.
- For the input `1`, the correct output is `1` because the string is already sorted.
- For the input `10`, the correct output is `2` because the string can be split into `1` and `0`.
- For the input `0001111`, the correct output is `1` because the string is already sorted.
- For the input `0110`, the correct output is `2` because the string can be split into `011` and `0`.

The original program does not handle these cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
