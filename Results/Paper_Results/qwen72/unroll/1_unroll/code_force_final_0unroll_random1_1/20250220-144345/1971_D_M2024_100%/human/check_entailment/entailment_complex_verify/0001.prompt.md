You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The loop will print the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` for each binary string `a` provided as input. If `cut0` is 0, it will print `cut1 + 1`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` will be reset to 0 for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input. It then counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`) in the string `a`. After processing the string, if `cut0` is 0, it prints `cut1 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` are reset to 0 for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that can be cut from a given binary string such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `a` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If it encounters a transition from '1' to '0', it increments `cut1`.
     - If it encounters a transition from '0' to '1', it increments `cut0`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `cut0` is zero.
     - If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0's after '1's, and the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece. In this case, it prints `cut1 + 1`.
     - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are '0's after '1's, and the string needs to be cut into pieces to sort it. In this case, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies transitions between '0' and '1' and '1' and '0'.
   - The logic for determining the number of pieces is based on the transitions:
     - `cut1` counts the number of times '1' is followed by '0', which indicates the number of pieces needed to separate '1's from '0's.
     - `cut0` counts the number of times '0' is followed by '1', which indicates the number of times '0's need to be separated from '1's.
   - If `cut0` is zero, it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece, so the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If `cut0` is not zero, it means the string needs to be cut into pieces to sort it, so the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" and "1").
   - It also handles the case where the string has a single transition (e.g., "10").
   - It correctly handles the case where the string has multiple transitions (e.g., "11010" and "0110").

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples:
     - "11010" results in 3 pieces.
     - "00000000" results in 1 piece.
     - "1" results in 1 piece.
     - "10" results in 2 pieces.
     - "0001111" results in 1 piece.
     - "0110" results in 2 pieces.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to sort a binary string. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
