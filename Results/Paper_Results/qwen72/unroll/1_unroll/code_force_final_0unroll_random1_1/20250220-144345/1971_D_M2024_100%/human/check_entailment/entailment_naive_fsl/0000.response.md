Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and contains no transitions between '0' and '1'. For example, for the input "11111111", the program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1 because the string is already sorted and no cuts are needed. The program should return 1 if there are no transitions (i.e., `cut0 + cut1 == 0`), as the string is already sorted.
