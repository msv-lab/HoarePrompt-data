#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The loop will print the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` for each binary string `a` provided as input. If `cut0` is 0, it will print `cut1 + 1`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` will be reset to 0 for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input. It then counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`) in the string `a`. After processing the string, if `cut0` is 0, it prints `cut1 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` are reset to 0 for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case.
