The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1, and `N` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `N` must be greater than 1**
