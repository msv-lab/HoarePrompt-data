### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the input \( n \) is an integer between 1 and \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) in an array `pd`.
   - This is done to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each test case, which would be inefficient given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `N` is set to \( 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \) to ensure the array `pd` has enough space to store the sums for all numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - `pd` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `N`.

4. **Precomputation Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - For each number `i`, `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` (the sum of digits of all numbers from 1 to \( i-1 \)) and the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - The sum of the digits of `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.

5. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints `pd[n]`, which contains the precomputed sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(N \times \log N) \) time, where \( N = 2 \times 10^5 \). This is because for each number `i`, the sum of its digits is calculated in \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The test case handling step runs in \( O(t) \) time, where \( t \) is the number of test cases. Each test case is handled in constant time \( O(1) \) by simply accessing the precomputed value.

7. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - For each test case, it correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed sum for the given `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient, meeting the requirements of the problem statement and the time limit.

Correctness: **True**
