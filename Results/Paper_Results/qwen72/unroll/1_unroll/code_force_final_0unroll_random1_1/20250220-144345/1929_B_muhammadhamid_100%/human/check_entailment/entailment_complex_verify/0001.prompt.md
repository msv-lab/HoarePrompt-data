You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each input pair (n, k) provided, and for each pair, it will print a value based on the conditions specified. The variables n and k will be updated with each iteration based on the input provided, but they will not retain any specific value after the loop completes. The loop will continue to execute until all input pairs have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through user input. For each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: If k is 1, it prints 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * (n + (n - 2)), it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated results for each input pair. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes, and the variables n and k do not retain any specific values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (2 main diagonals and \( 2(n-1) \) other diagonals).

2. **Special Cases**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition. This is handled correctly by the program with `print(1)` and `continue`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program checks if \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \). This condition simplifies to \( k \leq 4n - 4 \).
   - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If \( k > 4n - 4 \), the program prints `k // 2 + 1`.

4. **Analysis of the General Case**:
   - For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the program uses `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
   - For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the program uses `k // 2 + 1`. This is because when \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 4 \), we need to cover more than half of the diagonals. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals by adding one extra cell to handle the odd number of diagonals.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( 4 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \), so the program prints `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( 3 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \), so the program prints `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( 10 > 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \), so the program prints `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - \( 9 > 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \), so the program prints `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):
     - \( 7 \leq 4 \times 4 - 4 = 12 \), so the program prints `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \):
     - \( 11 \leq 4 \times 7 - 4 = 24 \), so the program prints `math.ceil(11 / 2) = 6`.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( 3 > 4 \times 2 - 4 = 4 \), so the program prints `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles the special case \( k = 1 \).
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \).
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed for \( k > 4n - 4 \).

Therefore, the program is correct.
