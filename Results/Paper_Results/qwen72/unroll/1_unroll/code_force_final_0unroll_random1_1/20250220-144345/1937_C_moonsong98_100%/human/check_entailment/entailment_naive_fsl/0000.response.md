Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum XOR value is achieved by a pair of indices that are not the maximum and minimum indices in the permutation. The current logic in `func_3` attempts to find the maximum and minimum indices based on the bitwise OR operation, but this approach does not guarantee that the XOR of these indices will be the maximum possible value. For example, consider the permutation `p = [0, 2, 1, 3]`. The maximum XOR value is achieved by the pair `(0, 3)` or `(1, 2)`, both of which yield `3`. However, the program might incorrectly identify the maximum index as `3` and the minimum index as `0`, leading to a suboptimal solution.
