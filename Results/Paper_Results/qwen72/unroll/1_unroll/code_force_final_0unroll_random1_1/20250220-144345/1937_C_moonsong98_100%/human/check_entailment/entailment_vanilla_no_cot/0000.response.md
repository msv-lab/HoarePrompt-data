Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it attempts to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of Queries**:
   - The program uses the bitwise OR operation (`|`) in its queries, but the problem requires finding the maximum bitwise XOR (`⊕`) value.
   - The logic for determining the maximum and minimum indices based on the OR operation does not necessarily lead to the correct indices for the maximum XOR value.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum XOR**:
   - The program assumes that the maximum OR value will help in finding the maximum XOR value, which is not always true. The maximum OR value and the maximum XOR value can be different and are not directly related in the way the program suggests.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple indices have the same OR value. It simply appends them to `min_indices` without considering how to find the correct pair for the maximum XOR.

3. **Inefficient Query Usage**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the maximum index based on the OR operation, which is not necessary for finding the maximum XOR value.
   - The program also uses another loop to find the minimum index, which again is not the correct approach for maximizing XOR.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, a more effective strategy would be to use a divide-and-conquer approach or a binary search on the bits of the permutation to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:

1. **Determine the Maximum Bit**:
   - Identify the highest bit position that can be set in the permutation values. This can be done by querying pairs of indices to determine if the highest bit is set in any of the values.

2. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Split the indices into two groups based on whether the highest bit is set or not.
   - Recursively find the maximum XOR in each group and combine the results to find the overall maximum XOR.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to determine the bit positions that can be set in the XOR value.
   - Query pairs of indices to determine which bit positions contribute to the maximum XOR.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a simplified version of a correct solution using a divide-and-conquer approach:

```python
import sys

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input().strip()

def func_2(a, b):
    print(f'! {a} {b}')
    sys.stdout.flush()

def find_max_xor(n):
    if n == 2:
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
    max_xor = 0
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        res = func_1(0, i, 0, i)
        if res == '>':
            max_index = i
    min_index = max_index
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        res = func_1(max_index, i, max_index, i)
        if res == '<':
            min_index = i
            break
    func_2(max_index, min_index)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    find_max_xor(n)
```

This solution is more aligned with the problem's requirements and should correctly find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
