The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers within the range of a permutation `p` (0 to n-1, where n is the length of `p`). It prints the string `! [a] [b]` to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the integer values of `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the standard output will contain the printed string, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of the print operation.
