Reasoning:

The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) such that the bitwise XOR of \(p_i\) and \(p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. The program provided is designed to solve this problem through a series of queries and logical deductions.

### Analysis of the Functions

1. **func_1(a, b, c, d)**:
   - This function is used to make a query to the interactor.
   - It prints the query in the format `? a b c d` and reads the response from the interactor.
   - The response is one of `<`, `=`, or `>`, indicating the result of the comparison \((p_a \mid p_b) \text{ vs } (p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **func_2(a, b)**:
   - This function is used to output the final answer.
   - It prints the indices `a` and `b` in the format `! a b` and flushes the output.
   - The indices `a` and `b` are supposed to be the ones that maximize \(p_a \oplus p_b\).

3. **func_3()**:
   - This function is the main function that solves the problem.
   - It reads the value of `n` from the input.
   - If `n` is 2, it directly outputs `! 0 1` because for any permutation of length 2, the XOR of the two elements is always 1, which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \(n > 2\), it performs the following steps:
     - **Finding the Maximum Index**:
       - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
       - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}})\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
       - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
       - This step ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element that, when ORed with \(p_0\), gives the maximum value.
     - **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
       - It initializes `min_indices` with the `max_index`.
       - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices[0]}})\) with \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i)\).
       - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
       - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
       - This step ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices that, when ORed with `max_index`, give the same value.
     - **Refining the Minimum Index**:
       - It initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
       - It iterates through `min_indices` and compares \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}})\) with \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i)\).
       - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
       - This step ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`.
     - **Outputting the Result**:
       - It calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)` to output the indices that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

### Correctness

- **Finding the Maximum Index**:
  - The logic for finding `max_index` is correct. By comparing \((p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}})\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\) for all `i`, it ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element that, when ORed with \(p_0\), gives the maximum value. This is a valid approach because the OR operation is commutative and associative, and the maximum value will help in identifying the largest elements in the permutation.

- **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
  - The logic for finding `min_indices` is also correct. By comparing \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices[0]}})\) with \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i)\), it ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices that, when ORed with `max_index`, give the same value. This step helps in identifying the smallest elements in the permutation that are not equal to `max_index`.

- **Refining the Minimum Index**:
  - The logic for refining `min_index` is correct. By comparing \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}})\) with \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i)\), it ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`. This step is necessary to avoid selecting the same index for both `max_index` and `min_index`.

- **Outputting the Result**:
  - The final step of calling `func_2(max_index, min_index)` is correct. The indices `max_index` and `min_index` are chosen such that \(p_{\text{max_index}} \oplus p_{\text{min_index}}\) is maximized.

### Query Count
- The function `func_3` makes at most \(n\) queries to find the `max_index`.
- It then makes at most \(n\) queries to find the `min_indices`.
- Finally, it makes at most \(n-1\) queries to refine the `min_index`.
- Therefore, the total number of queries is at most \(3n - 1\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements in the permutation and does so within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
