### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should win a point. However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

Let's analyze the relevant part of the code to see if this is indeed the case:

```python
elif com == 'T':
    allPlayers[obj] = False
    if goalIn(pos) != -1:
        team = goalIn(pos)
        print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
        points[team] += 1
```

The `goalIn` function returns the team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) if the position `pos` is in a goal. However, it does not check which team the player belongs to. Therefore, if a red player (R0) moves to a red goal (RG) and throws the Quaffle, the program will print "RED GOAL" and increment the red team's score, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To handle this correctly, the program should check the team of the player before determining which team scores. If a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should win the point. Here is the corrected logic:

```python
elif com == 'T':
    allPlayers[obj] = False
    if goalIn(pos) != -1:
        team = goalIn(pos)
        if obj[0] == 'R' and team == 0:
            team = 1
        elif obj[0] == 'B' and team == 1:
            team = 0
        print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
        points[team] += 1
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
