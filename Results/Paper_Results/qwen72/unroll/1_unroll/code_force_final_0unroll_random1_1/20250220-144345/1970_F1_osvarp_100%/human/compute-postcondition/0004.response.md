Output State: **`n` and `m` are specific odd integers read from the input, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key `'.B'` mapped to the value `(-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams.**

The code snippet initializes the `goal` variable to a list containing two empty lists. This change is reflected in the output state, while all other variables retain their initial values.
