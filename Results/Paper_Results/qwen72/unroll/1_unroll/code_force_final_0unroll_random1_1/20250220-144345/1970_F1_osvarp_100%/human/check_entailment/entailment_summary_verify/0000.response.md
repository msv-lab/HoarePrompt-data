### Reasoning:

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**: This function is the main function that reads the input, initializes the grid, tracks the positions of players and goals, and processes the actions. It also prints the events and the final score.
   - **`goalIn`**: This function checks if a given position is a goal and returns the team index (0 for Blue, 1 for Red) if it is, otherwise -1.
   - **`isPlayer`**: This function checks if a given entity is a player by ensuring the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. It returns `True` if the entity is a player and `False` otherwise.

2. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should win a point. However, the program incorrectly prints "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" based on the goal's position rather than the player's team.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `func_1` function processes each action and updates the positions of entities accordingly.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`com == 'T'`), the program checks if the player is at a goal position using the `goalIn` function.
   - The `goalIn` function correctly identifies the team of the goal based on the position.
   - However, the program does not check the team of the player who is throwing the Quaffle. It simply increments the score for the team of the goal.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The issue lies in the following block of code:
     ```python
     elif com == 'T':
         allPlayers[obj] = False
         if goalIn(pos) != -1:
             team = goalIn(pos)
             print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
             points[team] += 1
     ```
   - This block should be modified to check the team of the player who is throwing the Quaffle. If the player's team matches the goal's team, the opposing team should score a point.

5. **Proposed Fix:**
   - We need to add a check to determine the team of the player and then decide which team should score the point.
   - The corrected block of code would look like this:
     ```python
     elif com == 'T':
         allPlayers[obj] = False
         if goalIn(pos) != -1:
             goal_team = goalIn(pos)
             player_team = 0 if obj[0] == 'B' else 1
             if goal_team == player_team:
                 # Player scored in their own goal, so the opposing team scores
                 print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[1 - player_team]))
                 points[1 - player_team] += 1
             else:
                 # Player scored in the correct goal
                 print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[goal_team]))
                 points[goal_team] += 1
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly, leading to incorrect scoring and output.
- Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
