N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99; P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10; T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair represents a cell on the field. The pairs can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, and ".Q" for the Quaffle. The actions are a list of T strings, each string containing a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action and a sequence of characters representing the action (U, D, L, R, C, T) and, in the case of catching, the ball's description.
