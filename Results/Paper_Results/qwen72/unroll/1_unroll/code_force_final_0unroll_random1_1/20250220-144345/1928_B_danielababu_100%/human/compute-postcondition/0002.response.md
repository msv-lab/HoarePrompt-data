The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(arr) - 1` is greater than or equal to -1. This means that `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list.

For the loop to be executed, the list `arr` must have at least one integer, and `i` must be set to the index of the last element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
