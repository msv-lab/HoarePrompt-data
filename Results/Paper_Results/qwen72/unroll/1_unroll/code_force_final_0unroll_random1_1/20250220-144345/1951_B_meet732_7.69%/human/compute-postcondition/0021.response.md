Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the index of the second element in `ind` minus 1 and `k - 1`. Since the first element of `ind` is 0, the second element of `ind` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Therefore, the program returns the smaller value between this index minus 1 and `k - 1`.**
