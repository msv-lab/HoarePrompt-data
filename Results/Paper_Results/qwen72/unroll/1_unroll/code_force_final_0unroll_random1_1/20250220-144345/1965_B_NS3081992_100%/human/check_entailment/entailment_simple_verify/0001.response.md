### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the sequence.

2. **Sequence Generation in `func_14()`**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates its length, `l`.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.
   - If `k != 1`, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It converts `k` to its binary representation and calculates its length, `lk`.
     - It initializes the sequence with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence is less than `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure the sequence can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.
     - It appends powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself as a string.
   - The main function `func_15()` writes the output for each test case.

4. **Validation**:
   - **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
     - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1.
     - For `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by appropriate subsequences.
   - **General Case for `k != 1`**:
     - The sequence is constructed by including powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, ensuring that the sum of these elements is less than `k`.
     - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to make the sum of the sequence just below `k`.
     - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
     - The remaining powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)` are added to cover the higher values up to `n`.

5. **Sequence Length**:
   - The sequence length is at most 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
  - When `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1.
  - For `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1. This is because the smallest possible subsequence sum is 2, and all other values can be formed by combinations of the powers of 2.

- **General Case for `k != 1`**:
  - The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`:
    - Powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)` are added, which ensures that the sum of these elements is less than `k`.
    - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to make the sum of the sequence just below `k`.
    - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
    - The remaining powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)` are added to cover the higher values up to `n`.

- **Sequence Length**:
  - The sequence length is managed by the loop that appends powers of 2, ensuring it does not exceed 25.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.
