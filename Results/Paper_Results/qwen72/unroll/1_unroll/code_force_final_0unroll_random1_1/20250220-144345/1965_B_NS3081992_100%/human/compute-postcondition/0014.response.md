The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `lk`. To ensure the loop executes, the range must have at least one value, which means `lk - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `lk` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 0 before the loop begins.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
