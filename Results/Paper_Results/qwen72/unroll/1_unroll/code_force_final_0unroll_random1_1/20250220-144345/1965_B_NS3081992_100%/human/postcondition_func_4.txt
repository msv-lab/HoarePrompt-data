The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the next line of input from the standard input has been consumed and the function has returned the line with trailing whitespace removed.
