Output State: **The program returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline character and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the number 2 repeated `l` times, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.**
