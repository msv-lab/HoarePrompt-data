The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. The string returned depends on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` and returns a string that consists of the length of `ans` followed by a newline character and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the number 2 repeated `l` times, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then powers of 2 from \(2^{lk-1}\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` and `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
