Output State: **`ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\) and the value \(k - 1 - \text{sum of the elements in } ans\), `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` remains the length of `bk`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value \(k - 1 - \text{sum of the elements in } ans\) to the list `ans`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.
