The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It relies on the output of `func_10()` to determine the number of test cases and the output of `func_14()` to determine the sequence for each test case. The function returns a result based on these outputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It uses the output of `func_10()` to determine the number of test cases and the output of `func_14()` to determine the sequence for each test case.**
