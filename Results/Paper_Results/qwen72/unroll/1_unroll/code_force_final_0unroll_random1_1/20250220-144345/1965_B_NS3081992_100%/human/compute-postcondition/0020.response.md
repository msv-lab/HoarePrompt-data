Output State: **`ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\); `n` and `k` remain unchanged; `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` remains the length of `b`; `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; and `lk` remains the length of `bk`.**
