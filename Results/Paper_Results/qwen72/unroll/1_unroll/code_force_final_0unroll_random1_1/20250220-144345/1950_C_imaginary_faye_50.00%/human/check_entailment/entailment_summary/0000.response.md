Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, and it seems to handle most cases correctly based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then reads each time string in 24-hour format.
2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**: It extracts the hours (`h`) and minutes (`s[2:]`) from the input string.
3. **Handling Midnight (00:00)**: If the hour is '00', it prints '12' to represent midnight in 12-hour format.
4. **Handling AM Times (01:00 to 11:59)**: If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
5. **Handling PM Times (13:00 to 23:59)**: If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.
6. **Appending AM/PM**: It appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12, and 'PM' otherwise.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic for handling hours between '01' and '12'. Specifically, the program should print '12' for '12:00' and '11:59' in the PM, but it currently prints '12' for '12:00' and '11:59' in the AM. This is incorrect because '12:00' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 PM' in 12-hour format, and '11:59' in 24-hour format should be '11:59 AM' in 12-hour format.

To fix this, the condition `elif int(h) <= 12` should be split into two separate conditions:
- `elif int(h) < 12` to handle AM times.
- `elif int(h) == 12` to handle the special case of 12:00 PM.

Additionally, the program should handle the case where the hour is '00' more clearly by ensuring it prints '12' followed by 'AM'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) < 12:
            print(h, end='')
        elif int(h) == 12:
            print('12', end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

Given the original program, the correctness is **False** because it does not handle the special case of '12:00' correctly.

Correctness: **False**
