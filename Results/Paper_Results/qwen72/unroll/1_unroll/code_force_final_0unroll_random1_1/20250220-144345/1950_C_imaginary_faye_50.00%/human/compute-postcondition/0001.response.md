Output State: **The function `func_1` will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases. The variables `t` and `s` will be unchanged, but the output will reflect the converted times.**
