The function `func_1` should take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), with `hh` ranging from 00 to 23 and `mm` ranging from 00 to 59. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), which is not included in the function definition provided.
