You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Program: 
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Annotated Code: 
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), with `hh` ranging from 00 to 23 and `mm` ranging from 00 to 59. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), which is not included in the function definition provided.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The function `func_1` will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases. The variables `t` and `s` will be unchanged, but the output will reflect the converted times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minute part `s[2:]` is directly used as it remains the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

3. **Converting Hours**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it is converted to '12' and printed.
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to '12', it is printed as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than '12', it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h` and then formatting it with a leading zero if necessary using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - The function uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and the condition `int(h) >= 12` to determine whether to print 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, it prints 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'AM'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the converted hour, the minute part, and the AM/PM indicator for each test case.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (00:00)**: The function correctly converts '00:00' to '12:00 AM'.
- **Noon (12:00)**: The function correctly converts '12:00' to '12:00 PM'.
- **Hour 13 and above**: The function correctly converts hours from 13 to 23 by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and follows the logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
