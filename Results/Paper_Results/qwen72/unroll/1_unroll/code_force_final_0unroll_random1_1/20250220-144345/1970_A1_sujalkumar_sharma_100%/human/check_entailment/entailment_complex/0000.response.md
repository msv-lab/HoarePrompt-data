### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input string `s` is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The function `func_1` is called with this string.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, index, character)`.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance based on whether the current character is an opening or closing parenthesis.
   - Each tuple `(balance, index, character)` is appended to `prefix_balance`.
   - The final balance is 0, as the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted using a custom key. The key is a lambda function that sorts the tuples first by the balance value in ascending order and then by the index in descending order.
   - This sorting ensures that characters with the same balance value are ordered by their original position in the string, but in reverse order.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The sorted list `prefix_balance` is used to construct the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.
   - The result string is returned.

5. **Output:**
   - The output is the balanced shuffle of the input string, which is constructed by the described sorting and concatenation process.

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
- The sorting logic ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the specified rules.
- The final result string is constructed by concatenating the characters in the sorted order, which should match the expected balanced shuffle.

### Example:
- For the input `(()(()))`, the prefix balance table is:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
  Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  ```
- After sorting, the table becomes:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
  Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  ```
- The result string is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
