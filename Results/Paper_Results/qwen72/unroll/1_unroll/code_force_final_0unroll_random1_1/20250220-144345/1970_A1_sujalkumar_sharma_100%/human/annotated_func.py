#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance value, the index `i`, and the character at index `i` of the string `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by concatenating the third elements of the tuples in `prefix_balance`, which is sorted by the balance value in ascending order, and for tuples with the same balance value, by the index in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses "(", ")" and returns a new string. The new string is formed by concatenating the characters of `s` in an order determined by sorting the characters based on their balance value in ascending order and, for characters with the same balance value, by their index in descending order. The balance value is the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses encountered up to that point in the string. The final state of the program is that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns the newly constructed string.
