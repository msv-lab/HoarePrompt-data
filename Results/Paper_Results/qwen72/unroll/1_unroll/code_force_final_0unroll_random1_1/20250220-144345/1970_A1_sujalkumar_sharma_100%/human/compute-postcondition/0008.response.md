The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string formed by concatenating the third elements of the tuples in `prefix_balance`, which is sorted by the balance value in ascending order, and for tuples with the same balance value, by the index in descending order.
