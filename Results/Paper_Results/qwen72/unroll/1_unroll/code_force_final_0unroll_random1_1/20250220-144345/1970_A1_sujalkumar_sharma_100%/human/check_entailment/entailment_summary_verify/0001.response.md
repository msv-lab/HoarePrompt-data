Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a standard and correct way to handle input strings in Python, ensuring that the input is clean and ready for processing.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, i, s[i])` for each character in the input string. It also initializes a `balance` variable to keep track of the current balance. As it iterates through the string, it appends a tuple to `prefix_balance` for each character, updating the balance accordingly. This step correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character.

3. **Balance Update**: The balance update logic is correct. For each '(', the balance is incremented by 1, and for each ')', the balance is decremented by 1. This ensures that the balance reflects the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to the current position.

4. **Sorting the Prefix Balance List**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means the list is sorted first by the balance in ascending order and then by the position in descending order. This sorting order is consistent with the problem description, which requires sorting by balance in ascending order and breaking ties by position in descending order.

5. **Constructing the Result**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This is done using a list comprehension to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and then joining them into a single string. This step correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input string.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of the `func_1` function, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string. The function `func_1` returns the correct string, and the program correctly outputs this string.

The program accurately follows the problem description and performs the required operations correctly. There are no logical errors or issues that would prevent it from producing the correct output for valid inputs.

Final: **True**
