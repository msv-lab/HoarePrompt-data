### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then converts the city coordinates from strings to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice: once for the original list of cities and once for the reversed list.
   - `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city in the list. It initializes `back` and `forward` to very large and very small values, respectively, to handle edge cases.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` and `forward` to the coordinates of the previous and next cities, respectively.
   - It then compares the distances to the previous and next cities and sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the next city is closer, otherwise, it sets it to the distance to the next city.
   - The function correctly returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the distance to the next city, based on the closest city rule.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are initialized with a single 0.
   - The prefix sums are calculated by iterating through the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists and accumulating the distances.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if `a` is less than `b` and prints the difference in prefix sums from `a-1` to `b-1` for the forward direction.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints the difference in prefix sums from `a-1` to `b-1` for the backward direction.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the way it handles the edge cases. Specifically, the condition `if i < n - 1:` is incorrect because it should be `if i < n - 2:` to avoid accessing `cities[i + 1]` out of bounds.
  - The function should also handle the case where `i` is the last city in the list, ensuring that `forward` is set to a large value to avoid incorrect comparisons.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_1`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The query handling logic is correct, but it depends on the correctness of the prefix sums.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 2:  # Corrected to avoid out-of-bounds access
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
- **Correctness: **False**
  - The program has a logical error in the `func_1` function that can lead to incorrect closest city distances, especially for the last city in the list.
  - This error can cause incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect query results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    
    # Corrected function call
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    cities.reverse()
    backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(a), int(b))
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1])
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in `func_1`)**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the `func_1` function, which can lead to incorrect closest city distances and, consequently, incorrect query results.
