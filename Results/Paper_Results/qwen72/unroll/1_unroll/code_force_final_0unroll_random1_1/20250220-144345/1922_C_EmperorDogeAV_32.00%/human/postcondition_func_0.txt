The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, and `n`, an integer indicating the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers. The first element of `prog_cities` is always 1, and the last element is the distance between the second-to-last and last city in the list `cities`. For all other elements, they are 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, otherwise, they are the distance to the next city.
