### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to large values to handle edge cases (first and last cities).
   - For each city `i`, it checks the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (indicating the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the previous city.
   - However, there is a logical error in the function. The function should set the cost to 1 if the closest city is the next one, but it incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city in the `else` block. This means the function does not correctly identify the closest city for all cases.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays: `pref_sum_f` for the forward direction and `pref_sum_b` for the backward direction.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated based on the costs to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated similarly but for the backward direction after reversing the `cities` list.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated, but they are based on the incorrect costs calculated by `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.
   - The query processing logic is correct, but it relies on the incorrect prefix sum arrays.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by initializing `back` and `forward` to large values.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated, but the costs they are based on are incorrect.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city, but the implementation in `func_1` is flawed.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query, but they are based on incorrect costs.
   - The program does not correctly handle the direction of travel and the appropriate prefix sum array due to the incorrect costs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described due to the logical error in the `func_1` function. The function incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city when the closest city is the next one, which leads to incorrect prefix sum arrays and, consequently, incorrect query results.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
