Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **`func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city. However, the logic in the function is flawed. The function should determine the closest city and the cost to travel to it, but the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cost to travel to the next city in the list, not necessarily the closest city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city. However, the way these prefix sums are calculated is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly return the cost to travel to the closest city, so the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Query Handling**: The program assumes that the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` is simply the difference in the prefix sums. This is not always correct, especially when the cities are not adjacent or when the closest city is not the next city in the list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_closest_city(cities, n):
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the second city
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest[i] = n - 2  # The closest city to the last city is the second last city
        else:
            if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) <= abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]):
                closest[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest[i] = i + 1
    return closest

def min_cost_to_travel(cities, closest, a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    if a < b:
        # Traveling from a to b
        cost = 0
        while a != b:
            if closest[a] == b:
                cost += 1
                break
            elif closest[a] > a and closest[a] < b:
                cost += 1
                a = closest[a]
            else:
                cost += abs(cities[b] - cities[a])
                break
        return cost
    else:
        # Traveling from b to a
        return min_cost_to_travel(cities, closest, b, a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest = find_closest_city(cities, n)
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_cost_to_travel(cities, closest, a - 1, b - 1))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **`find_closest_city` Function**: This function determines the closest city for each city. For the first and last cities, the closest city is the second and second-to-last city, respectively. For other cities, it checks whether the city to the left or the city to the right is closer.

2. **`min_cost_to_travel` Function**: This function calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`. It uses the `closest` array to determine the next city to travel to and adds the cost accordingly. If the closest city is the destination, it adds 1 coin. If the closest city is not the destination, it continues to the next closest city until it reaches the destination or it is cheaper to travel directly.

3. **Main Program**: The main program reads the input, calculates the closest cities, and processes each query using the `min_cost_to_travel` function.

This corrected program should now correctly handle the problem as described.
