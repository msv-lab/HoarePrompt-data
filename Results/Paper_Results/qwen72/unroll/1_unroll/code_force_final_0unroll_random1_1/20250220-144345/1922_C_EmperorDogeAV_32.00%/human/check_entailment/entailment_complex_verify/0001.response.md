### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to large values to handle edge cases (first and last cities).
   - For each city `i`, it checks the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (indicating the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays: `pref_sum_f` for the forward direction and `pref_sum_b` for the backward direction.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated based on the costs to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated similarly but for the backward direction after reversing the `cities` list.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by initializing `back` and `forward` to large values.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - The program correctly handles the direction of travel and uses the appropriate prefix sum array.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
  - The logic for setting `back` and `forward` is correct, but there is a mistake in the cost assignment:
    - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it should set the cost to 1.
    - If the distance to the previous city is smaller, it should set the cost to 1.
    - However, the current implementation sets the cost to the distance to the previous city if the distance to the next city is not smaller.
    - This is incorrect because the cost should always be 1 if the closest city is the next or previous city, not the distance to the previous city.

- **Correct Implementation of `func_1`:**
  - The correct implementation should be:
    ```python
    def func_1(cities, n):
        prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            back = -99999999
            forward = 99999999
            if i > 0:
                back = cities[i - 1]
            if i < n - 1:
                forward = cities[i + 1]
            if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
                prog_cities[i] = 1
            else:
                prog_cities[i] = 1
        return prog_cities
    ```

- **Impact of the Mistake:**
  - The mistake in `func_1` means that the `prog_cities` list will not correctly represent the cost to travel to the closest city.
  - This will lead to incorrect prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`.
  - Consequently, the minimum cost calculated for each query will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the mistake in the `func_1` function. The cost to travel to the closest city should always be 1, but the current implementation sometimes sets it to the distance to the previous city, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
