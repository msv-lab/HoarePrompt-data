Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving to the first.** 

In natural language, this means that the program returns a list where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` from the current position to the end of the list, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged. The variable `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, but it is not returned by the program.
