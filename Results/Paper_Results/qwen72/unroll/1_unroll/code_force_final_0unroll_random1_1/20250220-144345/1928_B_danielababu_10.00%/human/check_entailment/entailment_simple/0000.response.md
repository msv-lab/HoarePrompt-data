### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It then reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which correctly converts the input into a list of integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program finds the maximum element `m` in the array `arr` using `max(arr)`. This is necessary to determine the target value for the elements after adding the permutation.

3. **Creating the New Array:**
   - The program creates a new array `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`. This transformation is intended to find the potential values that can be added to the original array elements to achieve the maximum frequency of a single value.
   - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the new values are within the range of the permutation `[1, n]`.

4. **Sorting the New Array:**
   - The program sorts the `new` array. Sorting is a good approach to identify unique elements efficiently.

5. **Finding Unique Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the sorted `new` array and adds elements to a set `ans` if they are within the range `[1, n]`. Using a set ensures that only unique elements are stored.
   - The length of the set `ans` is printed, which represents the number of unique elements that can be added to the original array to achieve the maximum frequency.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the set `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of the program is to find the maximum number of elements in the array that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` is used to map the original array elements to a new set of values that can be added to achieve the maximum frequency.
- The use of a set to store unique elements is appropriate because it ensures that each value is counted only once.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input format as described in the problem statement.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the array `arr` already contains elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. However, the transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` should cover this scenario by ensuring that the new values are within the permutation range.
- The program does not check if the elements in `new` are distinct before adding them to the set, but this is not necessary because the set will only store unique elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, performs the necessary transformations, and outputs the correct result for each test case.
