### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` and the array `arr` using `func_3()`.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Permutation Addition and Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum value in the array `arr` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then creates a new list `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - This transformation is intended to find the potential new values after adding a permutation to the array `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Filtering:**
   - The new list `new` is sorted.
   - The program then creates a set `ans` to store unique elements from `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Permutation Addition:**
  - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` is used to find the potential new values after adding a permutation. This is based on the idea that the maximum value `m` in the array `arr` will be the highest possible sum after adding a permutation element (which ranges from 1 to `n`).
  - The idea is to check how many of these potential new values can be unique and within the range `[1, n]`.

- **Set and Length Calculation:**
  - By using a set to store the unique elements from `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`, the program ensures that it counts the maximum number of distinct elements that can be equal after the permutation addition.
  - The length of this set is then printed, which is the desired output.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array `arr` might already have elements that are very close to each other, making it difficult to achieve the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation.
  - However, the problem statement guarantees valid inputs, so this is not a concern for correctness.

- **Optimality:**
  - The program's logic is based on the assumption that the maximum value `m` in the array `arr` will help in finding the optimal permutation. This is a valid approach because the maximum value `m` will be the highest possible sum after adding a permutation element, and the set will ensure that only unique values within the range `[1, n]` are considered.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. The input handling, transformation, sorting, and set operations are all consistent with the problem requirements.
