You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

from collections import deque

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array a of length n, where each element a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case by reading an integer n and an array a of length n. For each test case, it calculates a new array res where each element res[i] is determined by the formula `mex - ar[i]` and updates the value of `mex` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the loop prints the resulting array res for each test case. The variables `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` from the array `a` in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for updating the `mex` value is flawed. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the current prefix of the permutation, but the program updates `mex` in a way that does not guarantee this property.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
However, the program will output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```
This is incorrect because the `a` values do not match the expected construction. For example, `a_3` should be `-2` (since `MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`), but the program's output would result in `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -3`, which is not correct.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
