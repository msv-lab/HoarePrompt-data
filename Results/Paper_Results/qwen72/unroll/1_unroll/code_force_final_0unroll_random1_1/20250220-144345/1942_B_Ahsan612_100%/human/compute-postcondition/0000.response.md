The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range determined by the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. This is because the loop is iterating over a range, and if the range is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. The state of the function `func` and the variables `n` and `a` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the context in which the loop operates.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which will make the loop execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
