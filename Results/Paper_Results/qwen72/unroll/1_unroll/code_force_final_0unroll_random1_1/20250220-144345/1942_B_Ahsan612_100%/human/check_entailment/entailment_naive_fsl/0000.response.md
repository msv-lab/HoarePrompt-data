Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` from the array `a` in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for updating the `mex` value is flawed. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the current prefix of the permutation, but the program updates `mex` in a way that does not guarantee this property.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
However, the program will output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```
This is incorrect because the `a` values do not match the expected construction. For example, `a_3` should be `-2` (since `MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`), but the program's output would result in `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -3`, which is not correct.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
