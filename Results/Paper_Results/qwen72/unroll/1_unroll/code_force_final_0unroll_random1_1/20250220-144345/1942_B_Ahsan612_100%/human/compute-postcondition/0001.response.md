Output State: **The loop processes each test case by reading an integer n and an array a of length n. For each test case, it calculates a new array res where each element res[i] is determined by the formula `mex - ar[i]` and updates the value of `mex` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the loop prints the resulting array res for each test case. The variables `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
