### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The solution initializes `mex` to `n`, which is correct because the MEX of an empty array is `n` (since all integers from `0` to `n-1` are not used).
   - The solution iterates over the array `ar` from the last element to the first, calculating `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to the value of `p_i` if `mex` is greater than `p_i`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization of `mex`:** The initial value of `mex` is set to `n`, which is correct.
   - **Backward Iteration:** The backward iteration is a valid approach because it allows the program to determine the MEX of the prefix of the permutation that has already been constructed.
   - **Calculation of `p_i`:** The calculation `p_i = mex - ar[i]` is correct because `ar[i]` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Therefore, `p_i` can be derived as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - ar[i]`.
   - **Update of `mex`:** The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that the MEX is correctly updated for the next iteration. However, this update is not always correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, not necessarily `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the case where `n = 1` correctly. For `n = 1`, the only possible permutation is `[0]`, and the MEX of an empty array is `1`, so `a[0]` must be `1 - 0 = 1`, which is consistent with the problem constraints.
   - The solution also handles the case where `n` is large (up to `2 * 10^5`), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`.
     - `mex = 5`
     - `i = 4`, `p_4 = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 3`, `p_3 = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 2`, `p_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 1`, `p_1 = 4 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 0`, `p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - The constructed permutation is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example.

   - For the second test case: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - `mex = 5`
     - `i = 4`, `p_4 = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 3`, `p_3 = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 2`, `p_2 = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 1`, `p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 0`, `p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - The constructed permutation is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which matches the example.

   - For the third test case: `n = 3`, `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`.
     - `mex = 3`
     - `i = 2`, `p_2 = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 1`, `p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - `i = 0`, `p_0 = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - The constructed permutation is `[2, 0, 1]`, which matches the example.

6. **Critical Flaw:**
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` is not always correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, not necessarily `mex - ar[i]`.
   - For example, consider `n = 4` and `ar = [1, 0, 2, 1]`.
     - `mex = 4`
     - `i = 3`, `p_3 = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 2`, `p_2 = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 1`, `p_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`, but `1` is already used, so this is incorrect.
     - `i = 0`, `p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - The constructed permutation is `[0, 1, 1, 3]`, which is invalid because `1` is repeated.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always correctly construct a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The update of `mex` is flawed, leading to potential invalid permutations.

Final: **False**
