Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Logic for Cutting and Forming Rectangles**:
   - The program checks if either dimension `a` or `b` is even. If at least one dimension is even, it proceeds to determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` (each `a // 2`). It then checks if `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" because the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` (each `b // 2`). It then checks if `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No" because it is not possible to form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` are 1 (e.g., 1x1 rectangle), outputting "No".
   - It also correctly handles cases where one dimension is 1 and the other is even (e.g., 2x1 rectangle), outputting "No".
   - For other cases where at least one dimension is even and the resulting halves are not equal to the other dimension, it outputs "Yes".

Given these points, the program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem as described.
