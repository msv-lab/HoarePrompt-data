The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even and `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `a` and `b` are no longer relevant.
