The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

Case_1: If a specific condition is met, the function returns 1 and 0.

Case_2: If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is a positive integer, the function returns the values `d` and `c`, which are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`.

Case_3: If another specific condition is met, the function returns 1 and a negative value that is one less than the result of integer division of `a` by `b`.

Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) and returns different pairs of values based on the input conditions. If a specific condition is met, it returns 1 and 0. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is positive, it returns the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`. If another specific condition is met, it returns 1 and a negative value one less than the integer division of `a` by `b`. Otherwise, it returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
