Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers, and the length of `b` is non-negative, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**. 

Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments, and it returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`. The specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are now part of the program state.
