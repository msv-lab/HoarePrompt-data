### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for calculating combinations and permutations efficiently, as the problem involves counting permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), which are the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index \(p[-1]\) is the same as the first suffix maximum index \(s[0]\), and if the first prefix maximum index \(p[0]\) is 1 and the last suffix maximum index \(s[-1]\) is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses a function `func_2` to calculate combinations. This function is a wrapper around `func_1`, which is used to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The combination \( \binom{k}{r} \) is calculated as \( \frac{a!}{b! \cdot (a - b)!} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the suffix maximums.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums (excluding the last one) and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix maximums.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results of these calculations and prints the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
  - If \(b = 0\), it returns \(1\) and \(0\).
  - If \(a < b\), it recursively calls itself with \(b\) and \(a\).
  - If \(a \% b = 0\), it returns \(1\) and a negative value.
  - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \(b\) and \(a \% b\) and returns the appropriate values.

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function calculates \(a \cdot b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(b^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the modular inverse and then returns the result of the multiplication modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Potential Issues:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` is used to compute the modular inverse, but it is not clear if the function correctly handles all edge cases, especially when \(b\) is not coprime with \(10^9 + 7\). However, since \(10^9 + 7\) is a prime number, every integer \(b\) in the range \(1 \le b < 10^9 + 7\) has a modular inverse.

- **Combination Calculation**:
  - The combination calculation in `func_2` should be correct if the modular inverse is computed correctly.

- **Permutation Counting**:
  - The program correctly accounts for the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverse calculations to efficiently count the number of valid permutations. The initial validity check and the combination calculations are implemented correctly.
