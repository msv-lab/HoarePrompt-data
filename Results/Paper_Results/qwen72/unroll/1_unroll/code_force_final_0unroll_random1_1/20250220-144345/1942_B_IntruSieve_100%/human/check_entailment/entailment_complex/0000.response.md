### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, `n` is read, and `arr` is read as a list of integers.
   - A list `mex` is initialized to store the MEX values.
   - A variable `minn` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used.
   - A dictionary `used` is initialized to keep track of the integers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Loop Analysis:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it means `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is positive. Therefore, `p_i` must be `minn`, and `minn` is added to `mex`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it means `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is non-positive. Therefore, `p_i` must be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and this value is added to `mex`.
     - In both cases, the value is marked as used in the `used` dictionary, and `minn` is updated to the next smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - The function prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, which should represent a valid permutation `p`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given `a`.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `used` ensures that the MEX values are correctly computed and used to construct the permutation.
   - The program prints the correct permutation for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
