Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from the user. It computes the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values for each element in `arr` and stores these values in a list `mex`. The MEX value for each element is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the MEX computation so far. The function then prints each MEX value in the `mex` list, separated by a space, followed by an empty line. The function does not return any value; it only performs I/O operations and modifies local variables. **
