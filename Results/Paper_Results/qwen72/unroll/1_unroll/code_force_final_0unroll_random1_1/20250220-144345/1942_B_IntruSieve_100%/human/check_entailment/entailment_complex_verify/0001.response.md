### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Understanding the MEX Function:**
   - For example, MEX([0, 1, 4]) is 2 because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

3. **Reconstructing the Permutation:**
   - We need to determine `p[i]` for each `i` based on the given `a[i]`.
   - The key observation is that `p[i]` can be derived from `a[i]` and the current MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]`.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the reconstructed permutation.
   - It also initializes `minn` to 0, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the numbers that have already been used in the permutation.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means `p[i]` is the current MEX, which is `minn`. The program adds `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The program adds this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used.
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the reconstructed permutation.

6. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case `arr[i] > 0`:**
     - The program correctly identifies that `p[i]` is the current MEX (`minn`).
     - It then updates `minn` to the next smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
   - **Case `arr[i] <= 0`:**
     - The program correctly identifies that `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
     - This value is derived from the relationship `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
     - The program ensures that this value is added to `mex` and marked as used.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `arr[i]` can be negative or positive.
   - The program ensures that the MEX is correctly updated and that no number is used more than once.

8. **Verification with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly tracks the current MEX (`minn`) and the used numbers (`used`).
   - The `mex` list is correctly populated with the values derived from the given `a` array.
   - The final output is a valid permutation `p` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The logic and steps are sound, and the program should produce a valid permutation for each test case.

Final: **True**
