Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The program reads the input, processes it, and outputs a valid permutation `p` for each test case.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_1` is called.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `n` is read, which is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - `arr` is read, which contains the elements of `a`.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the constructed permutation.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which will track the smallest non-negative integer not used in the permutation so far.
   - `used` is a dictionary to keep track of the integers that have already been used in the permutation.

4. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and `p[i]` should be `minn`. Therefore, `minn` is added to `mex`, and `minn` is marked as used.
     - If `arr[i]` is negative, it means that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and `p[i]` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Therefore, `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is added to `mex`, and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is marked as used.
   - After adding an element to `mex`, the program updates `minn` to the next smallest non-negative integer not used in the permutation.

5. **Outputting the Permutation:**
   - The constructed permutation `mex` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Positive `arr[i]`:**
  - If `arr[i]` is positive, `mex[i]` should be `minn` because `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) = minn` and `p[i] = minn`.
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Negative `arr[i]`:**
  - If `arr[i]` is negative, `mex[i]` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn)` because `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) = abs(arr[i] - minn)` and `p[i] = abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - This is also correctly handled by the program.

### Example:
- For the input `arr = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
  - `mex[0] = 0` (since `arr[0] = 1` and `MEX(0) = 0`)
  - `mex[1] = 1` (since `arr[1] = 1` and `MEX(0, 1) = 1`)
  - `mex[2] = 4` (since `arr[2] = -2` and `MEX(0, 1, 4) = 2`)
  - `mex[3] = 2` (since `arr[3] = 1` and `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) = 2`)
  - `mex[4] = 3` (since `arr[4] = 2` and `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) = 3`)

The output `0 1 4 2 3` is a valid permutation that satisfies the given `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the steps are aligned with the problem description, and the execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
