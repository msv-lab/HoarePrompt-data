To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 before the loop starts, as it is the initial value for the loop counter.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `used` is an empty dictionary.**
