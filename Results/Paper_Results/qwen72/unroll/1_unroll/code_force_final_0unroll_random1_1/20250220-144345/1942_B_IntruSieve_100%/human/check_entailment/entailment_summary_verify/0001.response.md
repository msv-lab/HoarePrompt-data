### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the length `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - It initializes `mex` to store the reconstructed permutation, `minn` to track the current MEX, and `used` to keep track of the numbers that have been used.
   - It iterates through each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it means `p[i]` is the current MEX, which is `minn`. The program adds `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The program adds this value to `mex` and marks it as used.
   - After processing all elements, it prints the reconstructed permutation.

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - **Positive `arr[i]` Case:**
     - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly identifies that `p[i]` is the current MEX, which is `minn`.
     - It adds `minn` to `mex` and updates `minn` to the next available MEX value.
   - **Non-positive `arr[i]` Case:**
     - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates `p[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
     - This calculation is based on the relationship `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`, which implies `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.
     - The program correctly uses `minn` as the current MEX and calculates `p[i]` accordingly.
   - **Tracking Used Numbers:**
     - The program uses a dictionary `used` to ensure that no number is used more than once in the permutation.
     - This is crucial for maintaining the properties of a permutation.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for `arr[i] > 0` is correct because it correctly identifies the current MEX and uses it to construct `p[i]`.
   - The logic for `arr[i] <= 0` is also correct because it correctly calculates `p[i]` using the relationship and ensures that the calculated value is not already used.
   - The program correctly updates the MEX and ensures that the permutation is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `arr[i]` can be negative or positive.
   - It ensures that the MEX is correctly updated and that no number is used more than once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The logic and steps are sound, and the program should produce a valid permutation for each test case.

Final: **True**
