The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters that are within the first `k` letters of the alphabet. If the function finds at least `n` such sequences, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, it prints 'NO' and then constructs a string by concatenating the characters from the sequences found, adding the first unique character from the first `k` letters of the alphabet that is not in the current sequence, and padding the rest of the string with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.
