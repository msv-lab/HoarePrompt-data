You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop prints a string that concatenates the characters in `ans` with the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for generating a string that does not occur as a subsequence in the case where the answer is "NO" is flawed. The program tries to construct a string by appending characters that are not in the current window, but this approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The expected output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the program will output:
```
NO
ab
```
This is incorrect because "ab" is a subsequence of "abb", and the program should have generated "aa" instead, which is a valid string of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence in "abb".

### Issues:
1. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
2. **String Generation**: The program's method of generating a string that does not occur as a subsequence is not robust and can produce incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.
