The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop will execute for each character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` will take on each character in `s` during the loop iterations.

State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the input, `s` is a non-empty string provided by the input, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0**
