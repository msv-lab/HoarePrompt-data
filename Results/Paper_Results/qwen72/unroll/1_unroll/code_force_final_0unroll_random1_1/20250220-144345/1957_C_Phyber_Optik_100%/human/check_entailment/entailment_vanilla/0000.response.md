Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and stores the invalid rows and columns in a set `invalid`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `-1` values.
   - It sets the base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board such that no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the DP values up to `n` using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
   - This relation is derived from the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a board. The term `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where the last row is empty, and the term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the configurations where the last row has a rook, and the rook can be placed in any of the `i - 1` columns, with the corresponding column being invalid for the next row.

4. **Handling Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program correctly identifies the invalid rows and columns by adding the row and column indices of each move to the `invalid` set.
   - The number of valid rows and columns is then calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - It uses `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` to ensure that the result is at least 1, which is correct because even if all rows and columns are invalid, there is still one valid configuration (an empty board).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning no initial moves have been made, by correctly calculating the number of configurations for a full `n x n` board.

7. **Performance**:
   - The program sets a high recursion limit to handle large values of `n` up to `300000`.
   - The DP array is precomputed up to `300000`, which ensures that the program can handle the largest possible input efficiently.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
