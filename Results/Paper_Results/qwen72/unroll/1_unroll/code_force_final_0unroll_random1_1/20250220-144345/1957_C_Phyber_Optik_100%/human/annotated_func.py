#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and the function is intended to be used as part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases, each with a different size of the chessboard and a number of moves k. However, the function definition provided does not include the parameter k or the move details (r_i, c_i), which are necessary for solving the problem as described. The function should be revised to include these parameters.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `dp[n]` is the value calculated by the loop, which is `(dp[n - 1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[n - 2]) % 1000000007`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates a value `dp[n]` using a dynamic programming approach. The value `dp[n]` is computed based on a recurrence relation: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`. The function returns the final calculated value `dp[n]`. The function does not modify any external state or parameters other than the `dp` array, which is assumed to be defined and accessible within the function.
