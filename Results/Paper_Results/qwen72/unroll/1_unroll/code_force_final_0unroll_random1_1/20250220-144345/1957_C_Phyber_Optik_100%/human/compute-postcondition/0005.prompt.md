You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and the function is intended to be used as part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases, each with a different size of the chessboard and a number of moves k. However, the function definition provided does not include the parameter k or the move details (r_i, c_i), which are necessary for solving the problem as described. The function should be revised to include these parameters.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `dp[n]` is the value calculated by the loop, which is `(dp[n - 1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[n - 2]) % 1000000007`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept a positive integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard and an additional parameter `k` representing the number of moves, along with move details (r_i, c_i). However, the provided function definition only accepts `n`. The function should be revised to include all necessary parameters to process the chessboard and moves.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
