Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible on an n x n chessboard after k moves, given the rules about placing rooks and the computer's mirrored moves. The key points to consider are:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Recurrence**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to fill the DP array for larger values of `i`. This relation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in a way that avoids attacks, considering the mirrored moves of the computer.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied by rooks.

3. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid positions remaining on the board by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the result of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which gives the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining valid positions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n - len(invalid)` is 0 or 1 correctly by ensuring `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that if there are no valid positions left, the program still prints 1, which is the correct behavior since the initial configuration is already valid.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly uses the modulo operation `1000000007` to handle large numbers, ensuring that the output remains within the required range.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the recurrence relation is correctly derived and applied.

Correctness: **True**
