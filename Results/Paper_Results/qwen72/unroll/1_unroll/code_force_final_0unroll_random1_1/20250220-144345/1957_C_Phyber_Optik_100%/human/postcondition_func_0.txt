The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates a value `dp[n]` using a dynamic programming approach. The value `dp[n]` is computed based on a recurrence relation: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`. The function returns the final calculated value `dp[n]`. The function does not modify any external state or parameters other than the `dp` array, which is assumed to be defined and accessible within the function.
