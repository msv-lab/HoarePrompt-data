Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, `dp[1]` is 1.** 

The value of `dp[1]` has been set to 1. The function is still intended to be used as part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases, each with a different size of the chessboard and a number of moves `k`. However, the function definition provided does not include the parameter `k` or the move details (`r_i`, `c_i`), which are necessary for solving the problem as described. The function should be revised to include these parameters.
