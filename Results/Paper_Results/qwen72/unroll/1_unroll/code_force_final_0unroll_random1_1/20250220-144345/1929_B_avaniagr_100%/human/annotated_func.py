#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: The loop reads input lines from the standard input (excluding the first line), parses each line to get `n` and `k`, and prints the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions provided. The variables `n` and `k` will be updated for each iteration of the loop, but their final values will be the ones from the last input line. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n` x `n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last input line processed. Other variables remain unchanged.
