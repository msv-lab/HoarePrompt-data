The function `min_cells_to_color` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8. `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) that should have at least one colored cell. It returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet this condition.**
