### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Diagonal Analysis:**
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right) and \( 2n - 1 \) anti-diagonals (top-right to bottom-left).
   - Each cell in the grid can be part of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

3. **Coloring Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to color cells that are part of multiple diagonals.
   - The most efficient way to cover the maximum number of diagonals is to color cells along the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.

4. **Cases Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( k \leq 2n - 1 \)**
     - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n - 1 \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells along the main diagonal.
     - Each cell on the main diagonal covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, so we need \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - **Case 2: \( 2n \leq k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - If \( k \) is greater than \( 2n - 1 \) but less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \), we need to cover both main and anti-diagonals.
     - We can color \( n \) cells along the main diagonal and \( \lceil (k - (2n - 1)) / 2 \rceil \) cells along the anti-diagonal.
     - The total number of cells needed is \( n + \lceil (k - (2n - 1)) / 2 \rceil \).
   - **Case 3: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), we need to cover all but one diagonal.
     - We can color \( 2n - 1 \) cells, which will cover all \( 2n - 1 \) main diagonals and \( 2n - 2 \) anti-diagonals.
   - **Case 4: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to cover all diagonals.
     - We can color \( 2n \) cells, which will cover all \( 2n - 1 \) main diagonals and all \( 2n - 1 \) anti-diagonals.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly handles the three main cases:
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \): It prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - \( k = 4n - 3 \): It prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - \( k = 4n - 2 \): It prints \( 2n \).

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the given problem and all the test cases. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of cells needed to color based on the value of \( k \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
