To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state right before the loop.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `x` is 1.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while x * x <= n:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the condition `x * x <= n` is true.
- Given that `x` is 1, the condition simplifies to `1 * 1 <= n`, which is `1 <= n`.
- Since `n` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), the condition `1 <= n` is always true for any valid value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time because the condition `1 <= n` is always satisfied given the constraints on `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
