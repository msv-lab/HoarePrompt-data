Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly, specifically when the string has more than 2 distinct characters but all possible rearrangements result in the string being equal to the original string. For example, consider the input string "abcabc". The program will output "YES" and then output "aabbcc" (or "ccbbaa" if reversed), which is a valid rearrangement but not necessarily a different string from the original. The correct behavior should be to check if any rearrangement is different from the original string before outputting "YES" and the rearranged string.

Another issue is when the string has exactly 2 distinct characters but they are not the same, such as "abab". The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks if the length of the set is 2, not if the string can be rearranged to be different from the original.

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Check if the string can be rearranged to be different from the original.
2. Only output "NO" if no such rearrangement is possible.
