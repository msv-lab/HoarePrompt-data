Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) in the input description, but this is not reflected in the current function definition. `n` is an input integer.**
