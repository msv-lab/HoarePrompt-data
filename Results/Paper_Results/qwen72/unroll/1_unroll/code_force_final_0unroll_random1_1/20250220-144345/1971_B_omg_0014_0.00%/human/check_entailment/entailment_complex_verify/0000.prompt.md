You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the input parameters are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) in the input description, but this is not reflected in the current function definition.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order, it prints the lexicographically largest version). The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated within the loop for each iteration, but their final values depend on the last string `s` processed. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of `s` (if `s` is not already in lexicographical order) or the lexicographically largest version of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `n` (unchanged), `s` (holding the last input string read), and `a`, `b`, and `c` (updated based on the last string processed).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly, specifically when the string has more than 2 distinct characters but all possible rearrangements result in the string being equal to the original string. For example, consider the input string "abcabc". The program will output "YES" and then output "aabbcc" (or "ccbbaa" if reversed), which is a valid rearrangement but not necessarily a different string from the original. The correct behavior should be to check if any rearrangement is different from the original string before outputting "YES" and the rearranged string.

Another issue is when the string has exactly 2 distinct characters but they are not the same, such as "abab". The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks if the length of the set is 2, not if the string can be rearranged to be different from the original.

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Check if the string can be rearranged to be different from the original.
2. Only output "NO" if no such rearrangement is possible.
