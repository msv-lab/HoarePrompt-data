The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then counts the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in `b` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function resets the count array `cnt_b` to a list of 1000001 zeros. The function does not return any value.
