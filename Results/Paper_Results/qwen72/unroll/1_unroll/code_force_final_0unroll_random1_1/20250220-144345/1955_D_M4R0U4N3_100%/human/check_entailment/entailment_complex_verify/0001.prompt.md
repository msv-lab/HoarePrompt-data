You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then counts the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in `b` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function resets the count array `cnt_b` to a list of 1000001 zeros. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the elements in `b` are not unique correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating `curr` and `cnt_b` is flawed when there are duplicate elements in `b`. Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the test case:
- The array `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The array `b` is `[2, 2, 3]`.
- The subsegments of `a` of length 3 are:
  - `[1, 2, 3]` (2 matches with `b`).
  - `[2, 3, 2]` (2 matches with `b`).
  - `[3, 2, 1]` (1 match with `b`).

The program should count 3 good subsegments, but it only counts 2 because it incorrectly handles the duplicate elements in `b`. Specifically, when the first `2` in `a` is removed from the sliding window, the program incorrectly decrements `curr` even though there is another `2` in `b` that can still match.
