The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is simply that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
