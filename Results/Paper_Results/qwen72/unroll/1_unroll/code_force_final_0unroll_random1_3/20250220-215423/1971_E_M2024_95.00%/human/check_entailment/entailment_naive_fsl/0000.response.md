Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the query point `d` is exactly at one of the known points `a_i`. Specifically, in the line where `s = bisect_left(a, ql)`, if `ql` is exactly at one of the points in `a`, the program should directly return `b[s]` without further calculation. However, the current implementation incorrectly subtracts `a[s - 1]` from `ql` and then calculates the time, which will give an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
4
6
2
7
```
For the query `d = 4`, the program should output `4` (since the car reaches point 4 at exactly 4 minutes), but the current implementation will incorrectly calculate the time as `5` because it subtracts `a[1]` (which is 4) from `ql` (which is 4), resulting in `ql = 0`, and then adds `b[1]` (which is 4) to `bd[2] * ql / ad[2]` (which is 0), giving a total of `4 + 0 = 4`. However, the program will output `5` because it incorrectly adds `bd[2]` (which is 3) to `b[1]` (which is 4), resulting in `7`.

To fix this, the program should check if `ql` is exactly at one of the points in `a` and directly return the corresponding time from `b` if it is.
