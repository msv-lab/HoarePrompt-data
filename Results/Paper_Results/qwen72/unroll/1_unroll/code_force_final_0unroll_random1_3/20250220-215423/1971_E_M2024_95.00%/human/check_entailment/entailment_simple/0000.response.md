Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the lists `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0) more easily. It also initializes `ad` and `bd` with `0` to store the differences in distances and times between consecutive points.

3. **Calculating Differences**: The program correctly calculates the differences in distances (`ad`) and times (`bd`) between consecutive points. This is necessary to determine the speed of the car between each pair of points.

4. **Calculating Velocities**: The program calculates the velocities (`v`) between each pair of points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`. This is correct because the speed is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.

5. **Query Processing**: For each query distance `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` of the first point in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. This is an efficient way to find the segment in which the query distance lies.

6. **Time Calculation**:
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, the program directly prints `b[s]`, which is correct because it means the car has already reached the exact point.
   - If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`, the program calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by first adding the time taken to reach the previous point `a[s-1]` (`b[s-1]`), and then adding the time taken to travel the remaining distance `ql - a[s-1]` at the speed `bd[s] / ad[s]`. The result is then rounded down using `int(m)`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the time for each query, and the final `print()` ensures that the output for each test case is on a new line.

8. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `ql` being 0 or equal to `n` correctly. For `ql = 0`, the time is 0, and for `ql = n`, the time is `b[k]`.

9. **Efficiency**: The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the segment for each query, making it suitable for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
