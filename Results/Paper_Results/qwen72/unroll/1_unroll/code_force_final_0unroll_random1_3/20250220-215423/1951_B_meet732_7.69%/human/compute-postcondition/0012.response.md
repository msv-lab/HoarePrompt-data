Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two cows in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. `c` is 2. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the value of `x` remains the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`. If `k` is 14, the current value of `k` is 14. `ind` is not an empty list, and the current length of `ind` is 1.**
