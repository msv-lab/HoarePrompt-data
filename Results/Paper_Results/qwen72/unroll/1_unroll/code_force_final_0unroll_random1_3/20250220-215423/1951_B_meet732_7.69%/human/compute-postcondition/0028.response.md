Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, where each rating is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different values based on the following cases:**

- **Case 1:** If the length of the list `a` is greater than 1, the function returns a value that is one less than the length of the list.
- **Case 2:** If the length of the list `a` is 14, the function returns 13.
- **Case 3:** If the first element of the list `ind` is greater than 14, the function returns the first element of `ind` minus 1.
- **Case 4:** If the first element of the list `ind` is less than or equal to 14 and not 0, the function returns the maximum value between `14 - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case 5:** If the first element of the list `ind` is 0, the function returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and 13.
- **Case 6:** If the first element of `ind` is the index of the first cow in the list `a` whose rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index 14, and the second element of `ind` is the index of the second cow in the list `a` whose rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index 14, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- **Case 7:** If the first element of `ind` is the index of the first cow in the list `a` whose rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index 14, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `14 - ind[0]`.

**Note:** Only one of the cases is executed, and the function returns the corresponding value based on the conditions met.
