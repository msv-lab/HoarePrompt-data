You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, where each rating is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value that is one less than the value of `n`. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact return value cannot be determined.

Case_2: The program returns 13.

Case_3: The program returns the value of the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is greater than 14.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is 14 and `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` which is less than or equal to 14 and not 0.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of the `ind` list minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Given that the first element of `ind` is 0 and `k` is 14, the program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and 13.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. `ind[0]` is the index of the first cow in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second cow in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. Since `k` is 14 and `k` is greater than the second element of `ind`, both `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are less than 14. The first element of `ind` is not 0.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first cow in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`, and `k` is 14.
