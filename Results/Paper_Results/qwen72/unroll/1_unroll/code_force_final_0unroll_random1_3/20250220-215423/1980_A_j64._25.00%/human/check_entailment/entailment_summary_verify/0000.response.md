### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining `t` and `test_cases` manually. This is a simplification for testing purposes and does not affect the correctness of the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` and `test_cases` as arguments and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the function initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements, all set to 0. This list is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - The loop `for prob in a` iterates over each character in the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the character's ASCII value. Specifically, `ord(prob) - ord('A')` maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on up to 'G' to 6.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation:**
   - The expression `max(0, m - f)` calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems. If the frequency `f` of a difficulty level is already greater than or equal to `m`, `max(0, m - f)` will be 0, indicating no additional problems are needed.
   - The `sum` function then adds up these values for all difficulty levels, giving the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the `results` list is returned and printed.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly counts the frequency of each difficulty level.
  - It correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems.
  - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
  - The logic is sound and handles all edge cases, including cases where there are not enough problems of any difficulty level and cases where there are more than enough problems of some difficulty levels.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where `n` is less than 7 (i.e., fewer than 7 problems in the bank).
  - It also handles cases where `n` is much larger than 7 and some difficulty levels are overrepresented.
  - The program correctly processes the maximum number of test cases (up to 1000) and the maximum values for `n` (up to 50) and `m` (up to 5).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case and handles all specified constraints and edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
