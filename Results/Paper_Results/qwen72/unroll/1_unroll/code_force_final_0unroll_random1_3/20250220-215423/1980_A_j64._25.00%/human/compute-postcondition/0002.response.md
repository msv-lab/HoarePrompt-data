The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `test_cases` and `results` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable**
