You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function performs a series of calculations and prints a value derived from these calculations. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) and processes each test case independently, with the state of variables reset for each new test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the results are printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a large number and `k` is close to `n`. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the k-th card laid down when `k` is in the range of cards that are multiples of higher powers of 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 8
```
According to the problem description, the order in which Vladislav lays down the cards for `n = 10` should be:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 10, 4, 8

The 8th card laid down should be 10. However, the program outputs 9, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic that calculates the position of the card in the sequence of multiples of higher powers of 2. The program incorrectly handles the transition between different groups of cards (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.), leading to incorrect results for certain values of `k`.
