You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions provided. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are modified within the loop, but their final values after the loop execution are not retained for the next iteration. Therefore, the initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` for the next test case are read from input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function performs a series of calculations and prints a value derived from these calculations. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) and processes each test case independently, with the state of variables reset for each new test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the results are printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The first part of the problem is to lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
   - The program checks if `k` is within the range of the first half of the cards, which are the odd-numbered cards. This is done using the condition `if k > (n + 1) // 2`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it directly prints the `k`-th odd-numbered card using the formula `2 * k - 1`. This is correct because the first `n // 2` cards are the odd numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Handling Cards Beyond the First Half:**
   - If `k` is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards, the program needs to handle the remaining cards.
   - The program uses a while loop to count the number of cards laid down in each subsequent step (i.e., cards that are 2 times an odd number, 4 times an odd number, etc.).
   - The variable `s` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `d` keeps track of the remaining number of cards that can be laid down in the current step.
   - The variable `i` keeps track of the current step (i.e., 1 for odd, 2 for 2 times odd, 3 for 4 times odd, etc.).
   - The loop `while s < k and d > 0` ensures that the program continues to lay down cards until the `k`-th card is reached or there are no more cards to lay down in the current step.

4. **Calculating the Position of the `k`-th Card:**
   - After determining the step `i` where the `k`-th card is laid down, the program calculates the position of the `k`-th card within that step.
   - The variable `g` keeps track of the number of cards laid down in all previous steps.
   - The variable `f` is the position of the `k`-th card within the current step, calculated as `f = k - g`.
   - The final card is calculated using the formula `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which correctly identifies the `k`-th card in the current step.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is within the first half of the cards (odd-numbered cards) correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is beyond the first half, ensuring that it correctly identifies the card in the subsequent steps.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles both the odd-numbered cards and the subsequent steps where cards are laid down in the specified order. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.
