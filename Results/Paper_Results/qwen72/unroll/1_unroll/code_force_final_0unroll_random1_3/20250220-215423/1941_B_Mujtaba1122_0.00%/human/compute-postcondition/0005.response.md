The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'. The precondition describes a series of operations that modify the list, but it does not affect the `print` statement in the given code snippet. The `print` statement is independent of the list modifications and the return value of the function `func_1(list, n)`.

Output: **NO**
