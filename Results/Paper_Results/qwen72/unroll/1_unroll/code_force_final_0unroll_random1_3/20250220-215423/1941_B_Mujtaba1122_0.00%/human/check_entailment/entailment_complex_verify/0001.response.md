### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - The function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The original implementation of the operation in `func_2` is incorrect. The lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     This is because the operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

4. **Correctness of the Operation**:
   - The operation should be applied in a way that ensures the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` will not work correctly because it incorrectly modifies the array elements by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The problem requires that the sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4.
   - The current implementation does not check this condition, which is a necessary step to determine the feasibility of making all elements zero.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2` and the lack of a necessary condition check to ensure the sum of the array is divisible by 4.

Final: **False**
