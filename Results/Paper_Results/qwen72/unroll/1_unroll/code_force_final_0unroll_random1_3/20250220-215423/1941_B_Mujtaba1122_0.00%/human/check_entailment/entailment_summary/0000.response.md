Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation that can be applied to any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) to decrement the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Functionality**: `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise. This is a straightforward and correct implementation for this task.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Functionality**: `func_2` attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
- **Loop and Condition**: The function iterates over the indices from 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)). For each index \( i \), it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
- **Operation**: The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. It sets `list[i-1]` to 0, and then subtracts `2 * list[i-1]` (which is 0) from `list[i]` and `list[i+1]`. This effectively does nothing to `list[i]` and `list[i+1]` because `list[i-1]` is set to 0 before the subtraction.
- **Correct Operation**: The correct operation should be:
  ```python
  list[i-1] -= 1
  list[i] -= 2
  list[i+1] -= 1
  ```
  This ensures that the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) are decremented by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Incorrect Operation**: The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform the required operation correctly. It sets `list[i-1]` to 0 and then subtracts 0 from `list[i]` and `list[i+1]`, which means the operation has no effect.
- **Output**: As a result, `func_2` will not be able to make all elements zero in most cases, and the program will incorrectly print 'NO' for many test cases where 'YES' should be printed.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is correct, but `func_2` is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
