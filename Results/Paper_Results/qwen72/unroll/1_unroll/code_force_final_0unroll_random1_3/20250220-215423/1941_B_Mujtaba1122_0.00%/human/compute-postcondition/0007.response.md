The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list` and `n`. `list` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

Output:
- Case_1: If `n` is less than 3 or greater than 2 * 10^5, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` is out of the valid range.
- Case_2: If `n` is within the valid range (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), the function returns a processed result based on the list and the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. If `n` is out of this range, it returns an error message. If `n` is within the range, it returns a processed result based on the list and `n`.**
