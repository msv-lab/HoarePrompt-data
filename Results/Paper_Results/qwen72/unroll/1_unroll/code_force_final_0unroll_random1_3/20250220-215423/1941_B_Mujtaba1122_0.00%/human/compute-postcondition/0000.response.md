The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, and the range function parameters. For the loop to execute, `n` must be such that the range `1` to `n - 1` is not empty. This means `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` will start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` is at least 3 (since `n` must be greater than 2) and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`list` is a list of integers with length `n`, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1**
