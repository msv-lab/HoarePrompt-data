### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Even and Odd Check**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. This is a correct approach because if either dimension is even, it can be split into two equal parts, and the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

3. **Splitting and Comparison**:
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` (each `a // 2`). It then checks if `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes" because the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle with dimensions `a1 * 2` by `b`.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` (each `b // 2`). It then checks if `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes" because the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle with dimensions `a` by `b1 * 2`.

4. **Odd Dimensions**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints "No" because an odd dimension cannot be split into two equal parts with integer sides, and thus, no new rectangle can be formed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 (i.e., a 1x1 rectangle), which cannot be split into two rectangles.
   - It also correctly handles the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is even, which cannot form a new rectangle.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem requirements. The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are valid.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle from the given dimensions and handles all edge cases appropriately.
