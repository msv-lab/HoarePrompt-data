You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, it checks if the even dimension can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the loop has completed its execution and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function checks if either dimension `a` or `b` is even and can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both dimensions are odd, it directly prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - After cutting, he can rotate and rearrange the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - The goal is to determine if the new rectangle formed is different from the original rectangle, considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side. The new rectangle will have dimensions \(a \times 2b\) or \(2a \times b\).

3. **Checking if the New Rectangle is Different:**
   - The new rectangle will be different from the original if the dimensions of the new rectangle are not the same as the original rectangle.
   - Specifically, if \(a\) is even and \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \), the new rectangle \(a \times 2b\) will be different.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even and \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \), the new rectangle \(2a \times b\) will be different.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the program correctly handles it by checking if the other dimension is even and different from 1.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
