### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
- He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle, considering that rectangles differing by a 90Â° rotation are the same.

#### Program Analysis:
The program `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

1. **Check if either dimension is even:**
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` (each of size `a // 2`).
   - It then checks if `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
   - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` (each of size `b // 2`).
   - It then checks if `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.

2. **Check if both dimensions are odd:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness: False**
- **Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are even and the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original. For example, for the input `4 4`, the program outputs `No`, but it should output `Yes` because a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles, and these can be used to form a 2x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x4 rectangle.**

#### Evaluation:
- **Case Analysis:**
  - **Odd Dimensions:** If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' because it is impossible to form a new rectangle by cutting an odd-dimensioned rectangle.
  - **Even Dimensions:**
    - If `a` is even and `a // 2 != b`, the program correctly prints 'Yes' because the resulting rectangles can be used to form a new rectangle.
    - If `b` is even and `b // 2 != a`, the program correctly prints 'Yes' for the same reason.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program checks if `a // 2 != b` or `b // 2 != a`. This is where the original assessment finds a flaw.

- **Flaw in the Program:**
  - For the input `4 4`, the program checks:
    - `a % 2 == 0` (True, `a = 4` is even).
    - `a1, a2 = 4 // 2, 4 // 2` (both `a1` and `a2` are 2).
    - `a1 != b` (False, `a1 = 2` and `b = 4`).
  - It then checks:
    - `b % 2 == 0` (True, `b = 4` is even).
    - `b1, b2 = 4 // 2, 4 // 2` (both `b1` and `b2` are 2).
    - `b1 != a` (False, `b1 = 2` and `a = 4`).
  - Since neither condition is met, the program prints 'No'.

- **Correct Behavior:**
  - For the input `4 4`, Bob can cut the rectangle into two 2x4 rectangles and then form a 2x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x4 rectangle.
  - Therefore, the program should print 'Yes' for the input `4 4`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where both dimensions are even and can form a new rectangle that is different from the original. The program should be modified to correctly handle this case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
