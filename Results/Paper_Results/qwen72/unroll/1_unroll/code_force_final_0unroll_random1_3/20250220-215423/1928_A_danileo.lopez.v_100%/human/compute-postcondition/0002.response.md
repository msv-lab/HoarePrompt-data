Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, it checks if the even dimension can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the loop has completed its execution and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case.**
