Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle. This matches the problem description.

2. **Even Dimension Check**: The function checks if either `a` or `b` is even. This is a valid approach because if either dimension is even, it can be split into two equal parts. The function then checks if the resulting equal parts are not equal to the other dimension. This ensures that the resulting rectangle is different from the original one (considering the 90-degree rotation equivalence).

3. **Odd Dimension Check**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the function directly prints 'No'. This is correct because an odd dimension cannot be split into two equal parts with integer sides, and thus, no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Output**: The function prints 'Yes' if a new rectangle can be formed and 'No' otherwise. The output is case-insensitive, which matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `a` and `b` are both 1, it prints 'No' because no cut can be made. If `a` or `b` is 2 and the other is 1, it prints 'No' because the only possible cut results in two 1x1 squares, which cannot form a different rectangle.

6. **Efficiency**: The function is efficient and will run within the constraints (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^9) because it performs a constant number of operations for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
