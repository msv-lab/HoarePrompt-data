The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `u2vs` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder**
