Output State: **The function does not take any arguments. It reads the number of vertices `n` from the standard input, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3. It also reads `n - 1` lines of input, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. `n` is now an integer value provided by the user.**
