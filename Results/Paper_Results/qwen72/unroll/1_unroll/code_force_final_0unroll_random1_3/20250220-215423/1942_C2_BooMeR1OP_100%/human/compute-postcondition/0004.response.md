Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs and processes each set to calculate and print a result. For each set, it accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. The function then calculates the number of valid positions to place a new element in the list, considering the constraints and the gaps between the elements. The final result, `ans`, is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function returns to its initial state, ready to process the next set of inputs. **
