The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, each of which is an object with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are not equal, the function returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance`, which is a non-zero integer. If the `balance` attributes are equal, the function returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer. The function does not modify the input objects.
