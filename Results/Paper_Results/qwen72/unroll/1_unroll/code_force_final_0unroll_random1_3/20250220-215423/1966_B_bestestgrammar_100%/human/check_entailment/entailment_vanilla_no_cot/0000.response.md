Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if the corners of the grid are different and then checks if there are any color changes along the edges. However, this approach does not account for all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.

For example, consider a grid where the corners are different but the edges are uniform. The program will incorrectly output "NO" in such cases. Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of making the entire grid uniform through operations that do not necessarily involve the corners or edges.

A correct approach would involve checking if there is at least one row or one column where all cells are of the same color. If such a row or column exists, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting the two farthest cells of the same color in that row or column and performing the operation to change the entire grid to that color. If no such row or column exists, then it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        # Check if there is at least one row or column with all the same color
        all_same_row = any(all(gr[i][j] == gr[i][0] for j in range(m)) for i in range(n))
        all_same_col = any(all(gr[i][j] == gr[0][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))
        
        ans = 'YES' if all_same_row or all_same_col else 'NO'
        print(ans)
```

This version correctly checks for the possibility of making the entire grid uniform by looking for at least one row or column where all cells are the same color.
