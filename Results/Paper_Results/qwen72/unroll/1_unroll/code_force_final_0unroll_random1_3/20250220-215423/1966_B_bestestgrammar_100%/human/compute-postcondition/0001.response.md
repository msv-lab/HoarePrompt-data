The only objects in the loop head are the variable `tc` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `tc` is the loop counter and will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
