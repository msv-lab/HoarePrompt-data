Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.**
