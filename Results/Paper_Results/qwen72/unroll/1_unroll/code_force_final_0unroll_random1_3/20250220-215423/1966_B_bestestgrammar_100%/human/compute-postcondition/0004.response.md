Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the grid. The function then checks if it is possible to transform the grid so that the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color by only changing the colors of the cells on the borders. If it is possible, the function prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the output for each test case is printed. **
