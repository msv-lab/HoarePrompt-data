### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Cases Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - The loop in `func_15()` runs `t` times, each time calling `func_14()` to handle one test case.

2. **Handling Each Test Case:**
   - `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then determines the binary representation of `n` and `k` to help construct the sequence `ans`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence `ans`:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `1\n2`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 from `2^2` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence sum.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)` to complete the sequence.

4. **Output:**
   - The function `func_14()` returns a string with the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, separated by a newline.
   - `func_15()` writes this output for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `k == 1`**
  - For `n == 2`, the sequence `1\n2` is correct because it has a subsequence sum of 1 but not 2.
  - For `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 (since all elements are greater than 1) and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsets of these powers of 2.

- **Case 2: `k > 1`**
  - The sequence starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, ensuring that all values from 1 to `2^(lk-2) - 1` can be formed.
  - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
  - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
  - Additional powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)` are appended to cover the remaining range of values up to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `ans` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed by some subsequence.

### Correctness:
**True**
