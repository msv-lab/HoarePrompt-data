Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` as parameters. It returns a single string where each integer in `arr` is converted to a string, followed by the string `sym`, and all these parts are concatenated together. The final state of the program is that the function has returned this concatenated string, and the input parameters `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged. **
