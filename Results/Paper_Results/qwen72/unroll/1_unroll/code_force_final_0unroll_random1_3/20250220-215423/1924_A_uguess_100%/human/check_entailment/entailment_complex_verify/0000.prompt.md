You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if the string s contains at least n distinct subsequences of the first k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise it has printed 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first missing alphabet and the required number of 'a' characters to reach n distinct subsequences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct subsequences of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first missing alphabet and the required number of 'a' characters to reach `n` distinct subsequences. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem of checking whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Counting**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`, but it does not correctly count all possible subsequences of length `n`. The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters, but it is not used to generate or check all possible strings of length `n`.

2. **Incorrect Answer Construction**: If the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it constructs an incorrect answer. The string `ans` is built by appending characters from `s` and then adding a missing character and padding with 'a'. This does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is 1 or `k` is 1 correctly. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the only possible string is 'a', and the program should check if 'a' is a subsequence of `s`.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
3
1 1 5
aaaaa
2 2 4
abba
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
abc
```

In the third test case, the program incorrectly prints `abc` as the missing subsequence, but `ccc` is a valid string of length 3 that does not occur as a subsequence in `aabbccabab`.
