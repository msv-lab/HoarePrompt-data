### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - The output should be "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence, otherwise "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that does not occur.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences and `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in some order, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Bitmask Explanation:**
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` checks if the current character has not been seen before.
   - `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the bitmask to include the current character.
   - `cur == (1 << k) - 1` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in some order.
   - `cnt` is incremented each time all `k` characters are seen in some order.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program's logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed. It only appends one missing character and then appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to complete the string of length `n`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - For example, if `s` is "abb" and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly construct "aa" as the missing subsequence, which is not a valid answer because "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly handle the construction of the missing subsequence, the program should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by ensuring it does not match any subsequence in `s`.
   - One possible approach is to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If a string is not found, it can be printed as the missing subsequence.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle the construction of the missing subsequence. The logic for generating the missing subsequence is flawed, and it may produce incorrect results. The program should be revised to ensure that the generated string of length `n` is indeed a valid string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
