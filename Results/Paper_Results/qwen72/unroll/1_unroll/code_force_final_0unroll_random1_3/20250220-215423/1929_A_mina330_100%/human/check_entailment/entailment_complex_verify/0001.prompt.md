You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been modified as follows: `ntest` remains unchanged, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers read. The function has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each array for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array, then reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It sorts the list `a` and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the difference for each test case, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` are in the final state described in the comments. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element. The beauty is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]
   To maximize this, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Rearranging the Array**: The key insight is that to maximize the sum of differences, we should sort the array in ascending order. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and sorting ensures that the differences are maximized in a systematic way.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: After sorting the array, the maximum beauty can be achieved by taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is because the sum of differences in a sorted array will be:
   \[
   (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) = a_n - a_1
   \]
   This is the maximum possible beauty because the largest element minus the smallest element will always be the largest possible difference.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The maximum beauty is `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting gives `[69, 69, 69]`. The maximum beauty is `69 - 69 = 0`.
   - For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The maximum beauty is `100 - 43 = 57`.
   - For the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The maximum beauty is `4 - 3 = 1`.
   - For the array `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The maximum beauty is `2 - 1 = 1`.

The program correctly implements the logic to sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
