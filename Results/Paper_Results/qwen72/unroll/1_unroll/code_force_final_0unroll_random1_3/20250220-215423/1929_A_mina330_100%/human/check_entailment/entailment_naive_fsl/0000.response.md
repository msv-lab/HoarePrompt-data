Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, the problem requires calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates `3 - 1`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be `1`, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`. The provided program will output `1` because it calculates `4 - 3`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

However, for the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The correct output should be `57`, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` or `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`. The provided program will output `57` because it calculates `100 - 43`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

The issue is that the program does not actually calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the array. Instead, it only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the same as the required sum of differences.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This version sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.
