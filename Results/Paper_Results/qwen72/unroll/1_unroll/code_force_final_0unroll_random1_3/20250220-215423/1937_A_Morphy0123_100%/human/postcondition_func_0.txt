The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the position of the element 1 in the resulting array after performing swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 less than `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the position of 1 for each test case, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `power` are reset for each test case, so their final values are not meaningful.
