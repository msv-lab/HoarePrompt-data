The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function initializes an array `a` such that `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After performing swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`, the function returns the position of the element 1 in the resulting array.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and returns the position of the element 1 in the array after performing swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`.**
