### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires breaking a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The GCD \( d \) of the sub-problems must divide \( x \) (i.e., \( x \) is a multiple of \( d \)).
   - Additionally, \( d \) must divide \( x - n \cdot d \) (i.e., \( x - n \cdot d \) must be non-negative and a multiple of \( d \)).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( x - n \cdot i \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( i \). If so, \( i \) is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( x // i \). If so, \( x // i \) is another valid candidate for the GCD.
   - The maximum of these valid candidates is stored in `ans`.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( n \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the maximum GCD found.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 1 \) correctly, as the GCD of a single number is the number itself.
   - The program also handles the case where \( x \) is a prime number, as the only valid GCD in such cases would be 1.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is efficient for the given constraints \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Divisor Check:**
  - The program checks divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \) and also considers the complementary divisor \( x // i \). This ensures that all divisors of \( x \) are considered, as any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) will have a corresponding divisor \( x // i \) such that \( i \cdot (x // i) = x \).

- **Condition for Valid GCD:**
  - The condition \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \) ensures that \( i \) is a valid GCD.
  - Similarly, the condition \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0 \) ensures that \( x // i \) is a valid GCD.

- **Maximization:**
  - The program uses `max(ans, i)` and `max(ans, x // i)` to keep track of the maximum valid GCD found.

- **Test Cases:**
  - For the given test cases:
    - \( x = 10 \), \( n = 3 \): The valid divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The maximum GCD that satisfies the conditions is 2 (sub-problems can be 4, 2, 4).
    - \( x = 5 \), \( n = 5 \): The only valid GCD is 1 (sub-problems can be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).
    - \( x = 420 \), \( n = 69 \): The valid divisors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, and 420. The maximum GCD that satisfies the conditions is 6 (sub-problems can be 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, ..., 6).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating over possible divisors and checking the conditions. It handles all edge cases and is efficient within the given constraints.
