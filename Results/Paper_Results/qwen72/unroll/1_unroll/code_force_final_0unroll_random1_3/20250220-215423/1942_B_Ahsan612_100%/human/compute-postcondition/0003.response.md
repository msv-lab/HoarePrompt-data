Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of the same length `n`, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller. The function then prints the list `res` as a space-separated string for each test case. The variables `t` and `n` are consumed, and the list `a` is transformed into the output `res` for each test case. **
