Output State: **For each test case, the loop outputs a list `res` of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller. The final state of `res` is printed as a space-separated string for each test case. The variables `t` and `n` are consumed by the loop, and the list `a` is transformed into the output `res` for each test case.**
