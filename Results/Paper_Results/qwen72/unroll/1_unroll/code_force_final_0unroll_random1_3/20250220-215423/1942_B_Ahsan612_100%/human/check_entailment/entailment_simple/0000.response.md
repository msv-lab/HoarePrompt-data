Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, where `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, constructing the permutation `p` by setting `p[i] = mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` accordingly. Here's a detailed analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation `p`.
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it sets `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements as a space-separated string.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the sequence.
  - The program assumes that `mex` starts at `n` and is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller. This is a valid approach because the MEX of the sequence `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` should be a value that is not yet used in the permutation and is less than or equal to `n`.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program ensures that `res[i]` is a valid permutation by setting `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` and updating `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller.
  - This approach guarantees that each value in `res` is unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

- **Handling Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times.
  - Each test case is processed independently, and the results are printed for each test case.

### Example Verification:

- **First Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Initial `mex = 5`
  - `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4` (but `mex` is already 2, so it remains 2)
  - `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - Final `res = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - This matches the expected output and the MEX calculations are correct.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `mex = 5`
  - `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
  - `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - Final `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - This matches the expected output and the MEX calculations are correct.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - Initial `mex = 3`
  - `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 2` (but `mex` is already 0, so it remains 0)
  - Final `res = [2, 0, 1]`
  - This matches the expected output and the MEX calculations are correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the MEX calculations are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
