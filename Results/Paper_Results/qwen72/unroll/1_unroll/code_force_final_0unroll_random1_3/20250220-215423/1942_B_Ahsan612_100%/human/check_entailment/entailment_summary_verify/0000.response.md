### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the MEX calculation correctly. Let's break down the issues and the expected behavior:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - For each element `a_i` in the array `a`, the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` must hold.
   - This means that `p_i` can be calculated as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`.
   - It iterates through the array `ar` in reverse order, setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller.

3. **Issue with MEX Update**:
   - The program updates `mex` based on the current value of `ar[i]` without considering the actual MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.
   - This can lead to incorrect values of `mex` being used in subsequent calculations.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     0 1 2 3 4
     ```
   - However, the program will output:
     ```
     4 3 2 1 0
     ```
   - This is incorrect because:
     - For `i = 4`, `a_5 = 1` implies `MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_5 = 1`. Since `p_5` is 0, `MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)` should be 1, but the program sets `p_5` to 4, which is incorrect.
     - For `i = 3`, `a_4 = 1` implies `MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_4 = 1`. Since `p_4` is 1, `MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3)` should be 2, but the program sets `p_4` to 3, which is incorrect.
     - This pattern continues, leading to an incorrect permutation.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of used elements and calculate the MEX for each prefix dynamically.
   - For each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, we should:
     - Calculate `p_i` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
     - Update the set of used elements.
     - Recalculate the MEX for the next iteration.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updates, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

Final: **False**
