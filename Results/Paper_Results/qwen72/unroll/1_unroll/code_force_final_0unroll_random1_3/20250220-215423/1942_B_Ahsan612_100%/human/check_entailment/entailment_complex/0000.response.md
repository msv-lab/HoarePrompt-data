Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the MEX and Permutation Construction**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Given \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), we need to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from \( a \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `mex` to \( n \), which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - It iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order, from \( a_n \) to \( a_1 \).
   - For each \( a_i \), it calculates \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{mex} - a_i \).
   - It then updates `mex` to \( \texttt{mex} - a_i \) if the new value is smaller.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The key idea is that by iterating in reverse, we can ensure that the MEX value is correctly updated and used to construct the permutation.
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `ar[i]` is a non-negative integer (since \( -n \leq a_i \leq n \) and \( a_i \) is derived from MEX and \( p_i \)).
   - Therefore, `mex` is always updated to the correct value, and the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - It also handles the input format correctly, reading the number of test cases and the array \( a \) for each test case.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The output is a space-separated string of integers, which matches the required format.
   - The function ensures that the output permutation \( p \) satisfies the given array \( a \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
