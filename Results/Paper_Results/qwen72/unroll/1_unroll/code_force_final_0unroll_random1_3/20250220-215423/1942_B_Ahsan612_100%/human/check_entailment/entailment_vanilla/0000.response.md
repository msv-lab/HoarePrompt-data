Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - We need to determine the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The key insight is to work backwards from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. This is because the MEX of the entire permutation `p` is `n` (since `p` is a permutation of `0` to `n-1`).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `mex` to `n` (the MEX of the full permutation).
   - Iterate from the last element of `a` to the first.
   - For each `i`, calculate `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to `mex - a[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - a[i]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` by ensuring that `p[i]` is the value that satisfies the given condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The update of `mex` ensures that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is correctly maintained.
   - The algorithm handles the constraints and guarantees that the output is a valid permutation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm works for the smallest possible `n` (i.e., `n = 1`).
   - The algorithm also works for larger `n` and multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - For the input `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
