The function `max_triangles` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed under the given constraints for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case.**
