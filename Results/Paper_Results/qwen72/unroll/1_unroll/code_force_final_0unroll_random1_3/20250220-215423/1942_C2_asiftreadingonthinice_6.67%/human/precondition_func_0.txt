The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
