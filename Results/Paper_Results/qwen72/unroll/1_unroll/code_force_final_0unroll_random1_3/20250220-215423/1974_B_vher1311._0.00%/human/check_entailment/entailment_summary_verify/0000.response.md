### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the decoding process as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and analyze the function `func_1` in detail:

1. **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
   - The function correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the string `s` using `unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))`.

2. **Flawed Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and attempts to replace it with a character from `unique_chars` in reverse order.
   - The line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with the character at position `j` in `unique_chars`. This is incorrect because the replacement should be done character by character, not all at once.
   - The decrement `j -= 1` is intended to move to the next character in `unique_chars` to be used for replacement, but this logic is flawed because it does not maintain the correct mapping for each character in the original string `s`.

3. **Insertion of Non-Unique Characters**:
   - The `else` block attempts to handle characters that are not in `unique_chars` by inserting them into the list. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem guarantees that the input string `b` is the result of encoding a valid string `s`, and all characters in `b` should be in `unique_chars`.

4. **Incorrect Return Value**:
   - The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is a string of the unique characters in their original order, not the decoded string. This is not the desired output.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we need to create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters and then apply this mapping to the entire string. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    n = len(unique_chars)
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:
- **Mapping Creation**:
  - `unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))` creates a sorted list of unique characters.
  - `n = len(unique_chars)` calculates the number of unique characters.
  - `mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)}` creates a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in the list.
- **Decoding**:
  - `decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)` applies the mapping to each character in the string `s` to create the decoded string.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the decoding process as described in the problem. The logic for replacing characters is flawed, and the return value is incorrect. The corrected function provided above correctly decodes the string.

Final: **False**
