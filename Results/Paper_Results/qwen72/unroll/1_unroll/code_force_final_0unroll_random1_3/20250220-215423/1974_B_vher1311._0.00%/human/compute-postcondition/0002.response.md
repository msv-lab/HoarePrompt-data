To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the string `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`, so the loop will execute if `s` is not empty.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

The loop head is:
```
for char in s:
```

For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` (the length of `s`) is at least 1, the loop will execute as long as `s` is not empty. The other variables (`unique_chars`, `i`, `j`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `char` is the first character in `s`**
