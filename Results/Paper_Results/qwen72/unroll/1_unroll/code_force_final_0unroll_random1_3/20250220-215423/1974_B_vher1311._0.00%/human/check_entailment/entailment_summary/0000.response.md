Reasoning:

The program is intended to decode a string that was encoded using the specified algorithm. However, the implementation of the decoding logic in `func_1` is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Unique Characters Collection**:
   - The program correctly collects and sorts the unique characters from the input string `s` into `unique_chars`.

2. **Character Replacement**:
   - The program attempts to replace characters in the string `s` using a loop, but it does so incorrectly:
     - It replaces each character in `s` with the last character in `unique_chars` and then decrements `j`.
     - This approach does not correctly implement the symmetric replacement as described in the problem. Instead, it replaces all characters with the last unique character, which is not the intended behavior.

3. **Insertion of Non-Unique Characters**:
   - The program also attempts to insert characters that are not in `unique_chars` back into the list, but this is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process. The problem guarantees that the input string `b` is a valid encoded string, so all characters in `b` should be in `unique_chars`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is not the decoded string. The decoded string should be the result of the symmetric replacement of characters in `b`.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
- Construct the `unique_chars` list as it does.
- Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- Use this mapping to replace each character in the input string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In this corrected version:
- `unique_chars` is sorted and contains all unique characters from the input string.
- A dictionary `mapping` is created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- The input string `s` is then decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `mapping`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly decode the string as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
