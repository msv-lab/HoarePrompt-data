Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, the function is not correctly performing the decoding logic.

2. **Unique Characters**: The function correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the string `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b` in this context).

3. **Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list. However, the logic is flawed:
   - The `for` loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, but the `replace` method is used inside the loop, which replaces all occurrences of the character in the string `s` at once. This is incorrect because it should replace characters one by one in the correct symmetric position.
   - The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect. It inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which should not be modified during the decoding process.
   - The final return statement returns the `unique_chars` list as a string, which is not the decoded string `s`.

4. **Correct Decoding Logic**: To correctly decode the string, the program should:
   - Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
   - Use this mapping to replace each character in the string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

Given these issues, the program does not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
