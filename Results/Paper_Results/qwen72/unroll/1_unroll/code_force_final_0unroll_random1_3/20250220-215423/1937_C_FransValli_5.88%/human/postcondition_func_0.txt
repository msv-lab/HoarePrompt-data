The function `func` interacts with an environment that has a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is between 2 and 10,000. It processes up to 1,000 test cases, with the total sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 10,000. For each test case, the function determines and outputs the indices of the largest and second largest elements in the permutation `p`. The final state after the function concludes is that for each test case, the indices of the largest and second largest elements have been identified and printed in the format `! k best`, where `k` is the index of the largest element and `best` is the index of the second largest element.
