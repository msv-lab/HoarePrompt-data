The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates in an environment where there is a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from this permutation. The function is expected to run for up to 10^3 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an environment with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is between 2 and 10,000. It can make up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function is designed to run for up to 1,000 test cases, with the total sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 10,000. The function returns the result of its operations, which is not explicitly defined but is expected to be related to the hidden permutation.**
