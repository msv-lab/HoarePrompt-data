You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the variables `k` and `best` have been updated to the indices of the elements in the hidden permutation `p` such that `p[k]` is the largest element and `p[best]` is the second largest element in the permutation. The final output for each test case is in the format `! k best`, where `k` and `best` are the indices of the largest and second largest elements, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized.
   - We can make at most `3n` queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.
   - The queries are of the form `? a b c d`, and the response is either `<`, `=`, or `>`.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses a two-step approach to find the indices `i` and `j`:
     1. **Step 1**: Find an index `k` such that `p_k` is the maximum element in the permutation.
     2. **Step 2**: Find an index `best` such that `p_k \oplus p_best` is maximized.

3. **Step 1: Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `k` to 1.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 2 to `n-1` and queries `? 0 k 0 i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_k`, so `k` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `k` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

4. **Step 2: Finding the Best XOR Pair**:
   - The program initializes `best` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and queries `? k best k i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for maximizing the XOR with `p_k`, so `best` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `best` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `p_k`, gives the maximum value.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - After both steps, the program outputs `! k best`, which is the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

6. **Query Count**:
   - The first step makes `n-2` queries.
   - The second step makes `n-1` queries.
   - The total number of queries is `(n-2) + (n-1) = 2n - 3`, which is less than `3n` for all valid `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 2` correctly by directly outputting `! 0 1` without making any queries, as the only possible pair is `(0, 1)`.

8. **Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element and the best XOR pair.
   - The number of queries is within the allowed limit.
   - The program handles the interaction and output format correctly.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
