Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
