The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= `a` <= `n` and 1 <= `b` <= `m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The function ultimately computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` as the third element of the tuple, along with two other integers that satisfy the equation `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`.
