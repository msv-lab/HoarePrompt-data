The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the line into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not take any input parameters. After the function concludes, it returns a list of integers, and the state of the program is such that the standard input stream has advanced by one line.
