The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `data` is now assigned this list. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases` as described. `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries` with the conditions specified.**
