Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for competitive programming to optimize input reading. The index `idx` is used to traverse this list and extract the necessary values for each test case, which is a valid approach.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**: The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`. This is a crucial step for efficiently calculating the XOR of any subarray.

3. **Mapping of XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each possible XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly checking if a certain XOR value can be found within a given range.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR values, so the program appends "YES" to the results.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect` module to find the positions in the lists of indices stored in `mp`. If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values, and the program appends "YES" to the results. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

5. **Output Formatting**: The program appends an empty string after the results of each test case to ensure the output format matches the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray XOR is `0` or when the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR values.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently processes the input, constructs the necessary data structures, and handles the queries in a way that ensures the output is correct.

Correctness: **True**
