Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function processes each test case and returns the results based on the provided inputs.**
