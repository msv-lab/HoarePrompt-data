To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the updates that occur during the loop execution. Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- `points` is a list that will be updated based on the goals scored and the golden snitches caught during the loop execution.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary that will be updated to reflect the active status of players after each command.
- `elements` is a dictionary that will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the bludger (`.B`) after each move command.

### Loop Execution:
- The `points` list is updated based on goals scored and golden snitches caught.
- The `allPlayers` dictionary is updated to reflect the active status of players.
- The `elements` dictionary is updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the bludger.

### Print Statement:
```
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

### Analysis:
- `points[0]` and `points[1]` are the elements at index 0 and 1 of the `points` list, respectively.
- These elements are updated during the loop execution based on the goals scored and golden snitches caught.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state and depend on the loop execution, we can only describe their values based on the given information.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams, updated based on goals scored and golden snitches caught during the loop execution)**
