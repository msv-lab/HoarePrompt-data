### Reasoning:

1. **Data Structures and Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the grid, `elements` dictionary, `allPlayers` dictionary, `goal` list, and `points` list correctly based on the input.
   - The `mov` dictionary correctly maps the movement commands to their respective changes in position.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program processes each command in the game correctly. It handles the movement of players and the Quaffle, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle in the `elements` dictionary.
   - The program correctly checks if a player is carrying the Quaffle and updates the `allPlayers` dictionary accordingly.

3. **Scoring and Goal Detection:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly identifies if a position is a goal for either team.
   - The program correctly prints the scoring events and updates the `points` list.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Final Score:**
   - The program prints the final score after processing all commands, which is the correct output format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where a player moves to a position with the Quaffle and scores a goal.
   - The program handles the edge case where a player moves to their own goal and scores a point for the opposing team.
   - The program handles the edge case where the Quaffle is thrown and moves back to the middle of the field.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - The program assumes valid inputs as described in the problem, which is reasonable for this task.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the described problem and handle all the specified cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
