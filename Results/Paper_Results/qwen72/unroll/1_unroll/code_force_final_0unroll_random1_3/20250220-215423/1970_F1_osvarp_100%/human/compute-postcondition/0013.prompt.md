You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    #State: `n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values; `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary that now contains the positions of all non-`'..'` elements in the grid, with the key being the element and the value being a tuple (row, column); `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains all player elements (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) with the value `False`; `goal` is a list containing two lists, each with the positions of the goals for the respective players (0 for 'B' and 1 for 'R'). `points` remains [0, 0].

    #State: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `points` list will be updated based on the goals scored and the golden snitches caught during the loop execution. The `allPlayers` dictionary will be updated to reflect the active status of players after each command. The `elements` dictionary will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the bludger (`.B`) after each move command.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams, updated based on goals scored and golden snitches caught during the loop execution)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function generates and returns a value or values based on two predefined odd integers `n` and `m` within the range of 3 to 99.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
