Functionality: ** The function reads a grid of size `n` x `m` from the standard input, where `n` and `m` are predefined odd integers within the range of 3 to 99. It initializes a dictionary `elements` to store the positions of all non-`'..'` elements in the grid, a dictionary `allPlayers` to track the active status of players, and a list `goal` to store the positions of goals for two teams. The function then reads a number `t` indicating the number of commands to process. For each command, it updates the state of the game, including moving players and the bludger (`.B`), scoring points, and handling special commands like catching the golden snitch (`.S`) and eliminating players. After processing all commands, the function prints the final scores of the two teams. The function does not return any value but modifies the `points` list and the `allPlayers` and `elements` dictionaries as a result of the commands. **
