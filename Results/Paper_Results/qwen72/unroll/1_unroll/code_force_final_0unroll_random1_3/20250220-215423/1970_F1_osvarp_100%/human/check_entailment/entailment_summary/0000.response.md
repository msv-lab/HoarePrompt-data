### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid itself from the standard input. It also reads the number of commands `t` and the commands themselves.
   - **Initialization**:
     - `elements` dictionary is used to store the positions of all non-empty cells.
     - `allPlayers` dictionary is used to track whether a player is carrying the Quaffle.
     - `goal` list is used to store the positions of the goals for both teams.
     - `points` list is used to keep track of the scores of both teams.
   - **Command Processing**:
     - **Movement**: The function correctly handles the movement of players and the bludger (`.B`). It updates their positions in the `elements` dictionary.
     - **Catching the Quaffle**: The function correctly updates the player's status in the `allPlayers` dictionary when a player catches the Quaffle.
     - **Throwing the Quaffle**: The function correctly updates the player's status in the `allPlayers` dictionary when a player throws the Quaffle. It also checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
     - **Special Commands**: The function handles special commands like catching the golden snitch (`.S`) and eliminating players (when a player moves to the same position as the bludger or vice versa).
   - **Scoring**:
     - The function correctly prints the scoring events and updates the `points` list.
     - It correctly handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - **Final Score**: The function correctly prints the final score after processing all commands.

2. **Function `goalIn`**:
   - **Goal Checking**: The function correctly checks if a given position `pos` is in the set of goals for either team and returns the appropriate team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) or -1 if the position is not a goal.

3. **Function `isPlayer`**:
   - **Player Identification**: The function correctly identifies whether a given string `el` represents a player by checking if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. They handle the input, process the commands, update the game state, and output the correct events and final score. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
