Output State: **The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `points` list will be updated based on the goals scored and the golden snitches caught during the loop execution. The `allPlayers` dictionary will be updated to reflect the active status of players after each command. The `elements` dictionary will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the bludger (`.B`) after each move command.**
