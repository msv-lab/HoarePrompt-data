#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^4, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is the result of the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is the result of the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `m` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by iterating over `s` and appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by 'L' or 'R'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, and the returned list contains the cumulative product of these integers, modulo `m`, in reverse order.
