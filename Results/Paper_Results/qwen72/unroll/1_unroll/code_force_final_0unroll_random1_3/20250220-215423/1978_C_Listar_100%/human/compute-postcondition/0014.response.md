Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is even but greater than the maximum allowed value `max_k`. If `k` is even and less than or equal to `max_k`, it returns the integers `n` and `k`. The value of `max_k` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even. The function ensures that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. **
