Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**:
   - `func_4` reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs initial validation:
     - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
     - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
       - For odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
       - For even `n`, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
     - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
     - Otherwise, it returns the valid `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - `func_1` generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`:
     - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
     - It iterates over the range from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, incrementing a counter `c` at each step.
     - If `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, it returns the list `l` as the permutation.
     - If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to swap elements and return the modified list.
     - Otherwise, it updates `k` and modifies `l` using `func_3` to swap elements.
     - The function ensures that the permutation is generated correctly by manipulating the list `l` and adjusting `k` accordingly.

3. **Swapping Elements**:
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are responsible for swapping elements in the list `l`:
     - `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c`.
     - `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c`.
     - These functions ensure that the swaps are performed correctly to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Output**:
   - `func_5` prints the permutation if it exists:
     - It prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
     - It ensures that the permutation is printed in the required format.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_6` is the main function that processes each test case:
     - It calls `func_4` to get the validated `n` and `k`.
     - If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

**Correctness**:
- The program correctly handles the input validation and ensures that `k` is even and within the valid range.
- The permutation generation logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by swapping elements in a controlled manner.
- The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
