The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a sequence of four integers `p_i` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200`) from the input, calculates a value `cnt` based on the sequence, and prints `cnt`. The value `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the sequence are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in the sequence by 2. The function does not modify the input values `t` or `p_i`.
