The loop head involves the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the sequence of integers `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
