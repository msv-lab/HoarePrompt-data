### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move, placing a black rook at the position \((c, r)\) when the player places a white rook at \((r, c)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to count the number of different final configurations after \( k \) initial moves, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board with no rooks initially.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three valid configurations for a \( 2 \times 2 \) board.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
     - This relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in the first row and first column, reducing the problem to an \((i-1) \times (i-1)\) board.
       - Placing a rook in the first row and any other column, and then placing a rook in the corresponding mirrored position, reducing the problem to an \((i-2) \times (i-2)\) board.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then reads \( k \) moves.
   - It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - After reading the moves, the program calculates the number of valid positions left on the board by subtracting the size of `invalid` from \( n \).
   - It then prints the result of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which gives the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no valid moves left by ensuring the result is at least 1.
   - The DP array is precomputed up to \( 300000 \) to handle the maximum possible \( n \).

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for calculating the number of valid configurations is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
