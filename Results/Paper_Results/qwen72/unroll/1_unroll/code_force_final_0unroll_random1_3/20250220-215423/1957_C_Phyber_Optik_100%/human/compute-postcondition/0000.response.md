Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, `dp[1]` is 1.** 

The initial state specified that `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard. The code snippet assigns the value 1 to `dp[1]`. No other variables are affected, so the output state includes the unchanged value of `n` and the updated value of `dp[1]`.
