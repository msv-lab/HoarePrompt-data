The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the `range(3, n + 1)` function generates a sequence starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 3, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
