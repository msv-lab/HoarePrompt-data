Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the computer skips its turn when the player places a rook on the diagonal (i.e., when \( r = c \)). According to the problem description, if the player places a rook at a position where the row and column are the same, the computer skips its turn. However, the program does not account for this scenario, and it incorrectly adds the row and column to the `invalid` set, which would prevent the computer from placing a rook at the mirrored position. This can lead to an incorrect count of possible final configurations.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 1
2 2
```
The player places a rook at (2, 2), and the computer should skip its turn. However, the program will incorrectly add both 2 to the `invalid` set, which would treat the computer's turn as if it placed a rook at (2, 2), leading to an incorrect result.
