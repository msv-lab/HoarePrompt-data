You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a list of `n` integers `b`. If the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged after the loop, and the list `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Operation:**
   - The operation allows choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and performing the following updates:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - This operation effectively reduces the sum of the array by 4 and changes the values of three consecutive elements.

2. **Conditions for Solving the Problem:**
   - To make all elements of the array zero, the total sum of the array must be a multiple of 4. This is because each operation reduces the sum by 4.
   - Additionally, the elements at the boundaries (i.e., \( a_1 \) and \( a_n \)) need special attention because they can only be affected by the operations at \( i = 2 \) and \( i = n-1 \) respectively.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - For \( a_1 \) to be zero, it must be possible to reduce it by 1 multiple times. This means \( a_1 \) must be even (since it can only be reduced by 1 each time the operation is applied at \( i = 2 \)).
   - Similarly, for \( a_n \) to be zero, it must be even (since it can only be reduced by 1 each time the operation is applied at \( i = n-1 \)).

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( b \).
   - It checks if the first element \( b[0] \) is odd and if the second element \( b[1] \) is not exactly 2 more than the first element. If this condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - It also checks if the last element \( b[-1] \) is odd and if the second-to-last element \( b[-2] \) is not exactly 2 more than the last element. If this condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it prints "YES".

5. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program does not check if the total sum of the array is a multiple of 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be reduced to all zeros.
   - The conditions for the boundary elements are incorrect. The program checks if the first and last elements are odd and if the second and second-to-last elements are not exactly 2 more than the first and last elements, respectively. This is not the correct logic for ensuring the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the necessary conditions for the array to be reduced to all zeros. It only checks the boundary elements in a flawed manner and does not verify the total sum of the array. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results for many test cases.
