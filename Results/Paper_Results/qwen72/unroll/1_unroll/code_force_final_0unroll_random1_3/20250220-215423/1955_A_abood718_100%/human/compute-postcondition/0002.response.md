The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates under the assumption that there are multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, and `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
