#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The loop will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it, followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the time. The variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
