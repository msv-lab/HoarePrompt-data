Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of all the nodes directly connected to it by an edge. `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of all nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection (i.e., their list has a length of 1).**
