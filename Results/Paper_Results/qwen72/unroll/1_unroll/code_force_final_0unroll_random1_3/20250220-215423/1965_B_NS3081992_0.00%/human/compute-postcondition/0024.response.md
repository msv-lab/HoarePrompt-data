Functionality: ** The function `func_14` accepts no parameters and implicitly uses two integer values `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It returns a string. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a string containing the powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1) separated by spaces, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, the function returns a string containing a sequence of numbers starting with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. **
