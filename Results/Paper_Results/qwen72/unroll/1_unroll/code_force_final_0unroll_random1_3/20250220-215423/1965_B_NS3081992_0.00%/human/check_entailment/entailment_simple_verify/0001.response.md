### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_14` is the main function responsible for generating the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
   - `func_15` is the function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Function 14 Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which splits the input into integers.
   - **Base Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case where `n == 2` by returning the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - For other values of `n`, it constructs the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed by summing the powers of 2.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - It constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to `k-1`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
     - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures no subsequence sums to 1.
     - For `k > 1`, the sequence includes powers of 2 up to `k-1`, and the additional elements `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence includes all necessary powers of 2 to form any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` and `n == 2` correctly.
   - The function also handles the general case for `k > 1` and ensures the sequence meets the problem requirements.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Function 14:**
  - The sequence construction logic is sound.
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` is correct because it ensures no subsequence sums to 1 and covers all other sums up to `n`.
  - For `k > 1`, the sequence `[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ...]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and covers all other sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

Final: **True**
