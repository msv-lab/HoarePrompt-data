Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_14` generates a sequence that does not always meet the requirements of the problem description. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
10 7
```

Expected Output:
```
4
1 2 8 3
```

Actual Output:
```
1 2 4 1 8 15 3 21 33 65
```

The actual output sequence has more than 25 elements, which violates the constraint that the sequence should have a size of at most 25. Additionally, the sequence generated does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of 7, and it does not guarantee that all other values from 1 to 10 (excluding 7) have a subsequence that sums to them. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
