Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is flawed. The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m` and then prints `mn // a + mn // b` or `mn // a + mn // b + 1` based on certain conditions. However, this does not accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

2. The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not necessary and does not contribute to the correct solution. It incorrectly adds 1 to the result in some cases where it should not.

3. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the visibility period `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b
        if l <= m + 1:
            max_fireworks -= (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Explanation:
- The function `lcm(x, y)` calculates the least common multiple of `x` and `y`.
- For each test case, we calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the visibility period `m + 1` and the frequencies `a` and `b`.
- We subtract the number of times both installations launch fireworks at the same time, which is given by `(m + 1) // lcm(a, b)`.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
