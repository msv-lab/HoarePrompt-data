### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.

2. **Computation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The variable `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This represents the time at which the first firework from the installation with the lower frequency (either `a` or `b`) will be visible, plus the visibility duration `m`.
   - The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result, otherwise, it does not.
   - The result is computed as the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the time `mn`, which is `mn // a + mn // b`.

3. **Output:**
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mn`:**
   - The variable `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual time when the maximum number of fireworks could be visible simultaneously.
   - The correct approach should be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time within the LCM period.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding 1:**
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the scenario where the visibility duration `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.
   - The correct condition should be to check if the LCM of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, which would indicate that both installations can launch fireworks within the visibility window of a single firework.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to find the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time within the LCM period.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm(a, b)`, where `lcm(a, b)` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The calculation of `mn` and the condition for adding 1 are both incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
