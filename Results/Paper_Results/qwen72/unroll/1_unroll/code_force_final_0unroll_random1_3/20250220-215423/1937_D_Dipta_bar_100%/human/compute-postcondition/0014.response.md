Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to compute and print a series of integers. Each integer represents a specific calculation based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are populated with intermediate values used in the calculations. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
