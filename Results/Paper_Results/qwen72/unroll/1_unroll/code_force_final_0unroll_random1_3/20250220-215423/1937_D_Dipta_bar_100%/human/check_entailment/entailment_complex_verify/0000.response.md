### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the annotations to understand the behavior and validate the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` for each test case and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
     - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.

   - **First Loop (for '>' characters):**
     - The loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters up to the current index and appends it to `A`.
     - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

   - **Second Loop (for '<' characters):**
     - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end up to the current index and appends it to `B`.
     - It also appends the current index `i` to `idx_B`.

   - **Output Calculation:**
     - The program uses two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the lists `A` and `B` respectively.
     - For each index `i` in the string `s`:
       - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.
       - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.

3. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - **All '<' Case:**
     - If the string `s` is composed entirely of '<' characters, the first loop will not populate `A` or `idx_A` because there are no '>' characters.
     - The second loop will populate `B` and `idx_B` with the cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
     - When the program reaches the output calculation, for each '<' character, it will use the values in `B` to calculate the number of seconds. The logic for this case is:
       - `print(i + 1, end=' ')` if `l == 0`.
       - This correctly prints the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid from the left border.

   - **All '>' Case:**
     - If the string `s` is composed entirely of '>' characters, the first loop will populate `A` and `idx_A` with the cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - The second loop will not populate `B` or `idx_B` because there are no '<' characters.
     - When the program reaches the output calculation, for each '>' character, it will use the values in `A` to calculate the number of seconds. The logic for this case is:
       - `print(n - i, end=' ')` if `r == 0`.
       - This correctly prints the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid from the right border.

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the general case where the string `s` contains both '<' and '>' characters.
   - The cumulative counts and indices in `A` and `B` are used to calculate the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid, taking into account the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'. For the input:
```
1
3
<<<
```
The program will produce the correct output:
```
1 2 3
```
Similarly, for the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
The program will produce the correct output:
```
3 2 1
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
