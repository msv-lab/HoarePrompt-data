### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either a '<' or '>'. A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid string.
   - It then calls `func_1` to process the grid and print the results.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `A` and `idx_A` are used to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are used to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
   - **First Loop**:
     - Iterates over the string `s` to populate `A` and `idx_A` with the cumulative count of steps for '>' characters.
   - **Second Loop**:
     - Iterates over the string `s` in reverse to populate `B` and `idx_B` with the cumulative count of steps for '<' characters.
   - **Third Loop**:
     - Iterates over the string `s` to compute and print the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
     - The calculations involve using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total time.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The program correctly handles the inversion of characters by using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid is complex but follows the problem's rules:
     - For '>' characters, it calculates the time to move right and then left.
     - For '<' characters, it calculates the time to move left and then right.
   - The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid by considering the boundary conditions and the cumulative steps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the grid is entirely '<' or '>'.
   - It correctly processes the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid immediately.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the given test cases:
     - For `"><<"`, the output is `3 6 5`.
     - For `"<<<"`, the output is `1 2 3 4`.
     - For `"<><<<>"`, the output is `1 4 7 10 8 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the pinball movement and time calculation based on the provided problem description and test cases. The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input and prints the expected results.

### Correctness:
**True**
