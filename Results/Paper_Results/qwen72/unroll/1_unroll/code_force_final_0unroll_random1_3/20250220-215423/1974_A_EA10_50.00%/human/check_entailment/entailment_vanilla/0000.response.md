### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Screen Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using the formula `z = (y + 1) // 2`.
     - This formula is derived from the fact that each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and 15 - 8 = 7 cells are left for 1x1 icons).
     - The `+1` in the formula ensures that if `y` is odd, it rounds up to the next whole number of screens needed.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `m = 15 * z - y * 4`.
     - `15 * z` is the total number of cells available on `z` screens.
     - `y * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons.
     - `m` is the number of cells left for 1x1 icons.

5. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The formula used is `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
     - `x - m` is the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the remaining space.
     - `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` calculates the number of additional screens needed, ensuring that even if there is a remainder, it rounds up to the next whole screen.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens `z` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Formula for 2x2 Icons:**
  - The formula `z = (y + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons, and if `y` is odd, it rounds up to ensure all icons are placed.

- **Correctness of the Remaining Space Calculation:**
  - The formula `m = 15 * z - y * 4` correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons. This is because it subtracts the total space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total space available on `z` screens.

- **Correctness of the Additional Screens Calculation:**
  - The formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. This is because it ensures that even if there is a remainder, it rounds up to the next whole screen, which is necessary to fit all the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
