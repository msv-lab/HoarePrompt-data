The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of an array `a`. It then reads `a` as a list of `n` integers from the input. The function calls another function `func_2` with the array `a` and receives three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, where `s` is the sum of some elements in `a` and `m` is the maximum or minimum value of some elements in `a`. Additionally, it prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`. The function does not return any values. The original values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
