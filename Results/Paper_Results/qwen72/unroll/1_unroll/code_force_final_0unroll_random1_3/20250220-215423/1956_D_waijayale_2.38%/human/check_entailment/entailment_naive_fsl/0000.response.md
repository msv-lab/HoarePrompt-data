Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the `ops` list, which is required for the function `func_1` to append operations. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. The MEX operation should set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. However, the program sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  10 1
  1 4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will likely raise an error or produce incorrect results because of the issues mentioned above.

To fix the program, `recursive_maximize_sum` should be modified to accept and pass the `ops` list, and the MEX calculation should be implemented correctly.
