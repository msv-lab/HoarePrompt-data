### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r` (i.e., the subarray is a single element), it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If so, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
     - It calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, initializes the array `a`, and calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results as required by the problem statement.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The MEX value is correctly identified and applied to the subarray.
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The program correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is also not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_2` should pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

5. **Function Summaries:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - **Output States and Return Values:**
       - Modifies the array `a` by setting elements to the MEX value.
       - Appends operations to the list `ops`.
       - Returns nothing.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - **Output States and Return Values:**
       - Returns the sum of the modified array `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - **Output States and Return Values:**
       - Modifies the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
       - Returns nothing.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - **Output States and Return Values:**
       - Reads input and initializes the array `a`.
       - Calls `func_2` and prints the results.
       - Returns nothing.

6. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the function definitions and the way they are called.
   - The corrected program provided in the original assessment is indeed necessary to ensure that the functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` have access to the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program has issues with the function definitions and the way they are called. The corrected program should work as intended.

Final: **False**
