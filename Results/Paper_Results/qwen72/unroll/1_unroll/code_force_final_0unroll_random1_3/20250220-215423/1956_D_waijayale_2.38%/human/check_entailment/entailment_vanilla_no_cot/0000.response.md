Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function is intended to modify the array `a` and append operations to `ops`.
   - The base case for `l == r` is correct, but the logic for setting `a[l]` to 0 is incorrect. The MEX of a single element should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, which is 0 if `a[l]` is not 0.
   - The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` is made, but the logic for setting `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` is incorrect. The MEX of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` should be computed and used, not `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The function is intended to initialize the operations list and call the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - However, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the necessary parameters (`a` and `ops`).

3. **Function 3 (recursive_maximize_sum):**
   - This function is intended to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not correct for determining when to apply the MEX operation.
   - The logic for finding the maximum element and its position is correct, but the recursive calls should be made with the correct parameters (`a` and `ops`).

4. **Function 4 (func_3):**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to get the result.
   - The function is mostly correct, but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

**Corrected Approach:**

To correctly solve the problem, the MEX of the subarray should be computed and used to update the subarray. The operations should be recorded and the sum should be maximized. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex = 0
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    x = mex(subarray)
    if x > 0:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = x
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    func_1(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage:
# func_3()
```

In this corrected version:
- `mex` function correctly computes the MEX of a subarray.
- `func_1` recursively applies the MEX operation to the subarray and updates the array and operations list.
- `func_2` initializes the operations list and calls `func_1` to maximize the sum.
- `func_3` reads the input and prints the result.

This should correctly solve the problem as described.
