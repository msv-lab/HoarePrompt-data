Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l` calculates the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and then adds `l` to it to get the actual index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, and `mx` remain unchanged. The new variable `pos` is now the index of `mx` in the list `a`.
