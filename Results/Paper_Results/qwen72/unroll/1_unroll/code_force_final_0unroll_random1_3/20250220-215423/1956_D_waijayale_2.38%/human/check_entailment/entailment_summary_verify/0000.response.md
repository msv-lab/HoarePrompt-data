### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values, calls `func_2` with the array `a`, and prints the results.
   - The function summary is incorrect in stating that `m` is the maximum or minimum value of some elements in `a`. Instead, `m` is the number of operations performed.
   - The function correctly prints the sum `s` and the number of operations `m`, followed by the operations themselves.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the initial range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The function returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The function summary for `func_3` incorrectly describes the return values of `func_2`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` by recursively applying the MEX operation.
   - The function calculates the sum `s` of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to perform the MEX operation.
   - The function then appends the operation to `ops` and sets the values in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum `s` is greater, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively applies the MEX operation to the left and right subarrays.
   - The function does not pass the `ops` list to `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is a significant issue.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to perform the MEX operation on a subarray `a[l:r+1]` and append the operation to `ops`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the value at `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
   - For a range where `l < r`, it recursively calls itself with the range `[l+1, r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all values in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is not the MEX.

### Issues:
- **Scope of `ops`**:
  - The `ops` list is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_1`, leading to a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in their scope.
  - This issue is correctly identified in the original assessment.

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX operation is not correctly implemented. The program sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is not the MEX of the subarray.
  - The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, not `r - l + 1`.
  - This issue is also correctly identified in the original assessment.

### Specific Test Case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  10 1
  1 4
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program will likely raise an error or produce incorrect results because of the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues with the scope of the `ops` list and the incorrect implementation of the MEX operation. These issues will lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
