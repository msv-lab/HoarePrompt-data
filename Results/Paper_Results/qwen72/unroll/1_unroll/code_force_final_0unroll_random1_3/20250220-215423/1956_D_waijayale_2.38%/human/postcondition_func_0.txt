The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` and a list `ops` based on the indices `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if `a[l]` is not already 0 and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops` if the change was made. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively processes the sublist from `l + 1` to `r`. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function returns without any value, and the final state of `a` and `ops` depends on the initial values and the recursive calls.
