Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` and `pos - 1`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
- The function call itself does not change the state of the variables but initiates a recursive process.
- The initial conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid.
