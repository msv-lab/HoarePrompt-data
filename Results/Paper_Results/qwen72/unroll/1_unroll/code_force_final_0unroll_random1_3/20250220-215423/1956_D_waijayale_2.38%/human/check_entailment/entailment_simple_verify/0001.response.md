### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r` (i.e., the subarray is a single element), it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If so, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each key point.
       - The function ensures that if a single element is not zero, it is set to zero, which is a valid MEX operation.
       - The function also correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops` if the condition is met.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
     - It calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
       - The function correctly initializes the array and the operations list.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each key point.
       - The function correctly handles the base case and recursive calls to achieve the maximum sum.
       - The function ensures that the subarray is set to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops` if the condition is met.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, initializes the array `a`, and calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results as required by the problem statement.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
       - The function correctly reads the input and prints the results.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The MEX value is correctly identified and applied to the subarray.
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The program correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the `recursive_maximize_sum` function and `func_1` function need to correctly pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - However, the provided program already includes these arguments in the function calls, so the original assessment's correction is not necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
- The annotations and the program logic are consistent and correctly describe the behavior of the program.
- The program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints.
- The original assessment's correction is not needed as the program already passes the necessary arguments.

Final: **True**
