The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration. The state of the function parameters (t and the list of lists) does not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
