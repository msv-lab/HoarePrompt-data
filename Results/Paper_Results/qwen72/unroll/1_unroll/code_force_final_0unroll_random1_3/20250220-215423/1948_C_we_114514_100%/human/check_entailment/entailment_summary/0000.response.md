### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves left, right, up, or down every second and then follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and n is even.
   - The robot cannot move outside the grid or skip a move.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach cell (2, n) from cell (1, 1).
   - It iterates through the first half of the columns (up to `n // 2 - 1`).
   - For each column `i` in the first half, it checks if:
     - The arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` points left (`<`).
     - The arrow in `row2` at position `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` points left (`<`).
   - If both conditions are met, the robot is blocked and cannot proceed, so it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if:
     - The arrow in `row1` at the last position (`n - 1`) points left (`<`).
     - The arrow in `row2` at the second-to-last position (`n - 2`) points left (`<`).
   - If both conditions are met, the robot is blocked at the end, so it returns 'No'.
   - If none of the blocking conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2` from the standard input.
   - It calls `func_1` with the inputs and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions for the robot to be blocked.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the robot can only be blocked if the specific patterns of '<' are present, which aligns with the problem's constraints.
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n) from cell (1, 1) based on the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
