The function `func_1` accepts an even integer `n` within the range 2 to 200,000, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'. It checks if it is possible for a robot to move from position (1,1) to position (2,n) based on the conditions in `row1` and `row2`. If at any point during the check, the robot is blocked by '<' characters in a specific pattern, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `row1`, or `row2`.
