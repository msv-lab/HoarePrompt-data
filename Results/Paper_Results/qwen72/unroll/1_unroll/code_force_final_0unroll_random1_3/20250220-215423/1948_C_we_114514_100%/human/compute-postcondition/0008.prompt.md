You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it interacts with the input to obtain t, n, row1, and row2. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        row1 = input()
        
        row2 = input()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop, where `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are the inputs provided during each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop, printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of `row1` and `row2`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
