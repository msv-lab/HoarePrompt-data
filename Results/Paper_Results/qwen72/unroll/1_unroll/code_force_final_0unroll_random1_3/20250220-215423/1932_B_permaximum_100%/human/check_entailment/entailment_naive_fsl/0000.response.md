Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the first sign occurs in the first year. According to the problem description, the first sign occurs every `a_1` years, starting from year `a_1`. However, the program initializes `current_year` to 0, which means it starts counting from year 0, not year `a_1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1
3
```
The expected output should be `3` because the first sign occurs every 3 years, starting from year 3. However, the program will output `0` because it starts from `current_year = 0` and incorrectly calculates the next year as `0` (since `0 % 3 == 0`).

To fix this, the initial value of `current_year` should be set to `a[0]` instead of `0` for the first sign.
