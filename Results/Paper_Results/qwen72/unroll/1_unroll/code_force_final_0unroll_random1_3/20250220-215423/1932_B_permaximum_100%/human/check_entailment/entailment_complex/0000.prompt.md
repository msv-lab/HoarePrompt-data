Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of t elements, where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results`, where each element in `results` is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged after the function call.
