### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Test Case Storage:**
   - The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in the `test_cases` list, which is a reasonable way to organize the data.

3. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases. It takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Inside the function, a list `results` is initialized to store the results for each test case.

5. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0, which is the starting year.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.

6. **Calculating the Next Year:**
   - The program checks if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` using `current_year % ai == 0`.
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year is calculated as `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

7. **Updating Current Year:**
   - The `current_year` is updated to `next_year` after each sign is processed.

8. **Storing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.

9. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the next year is correct. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- The program correctly handles the sequential nature of the signs by updating `current_year` to the next year after each sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
- For the first test case:
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 3 (first sign)
    - 4 (second sign)
    - 8 (third sign)
    - 10 (fourth sign)
    - 18 (fifth sign)
    - 36 (sixth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 36.

- For the second test case:
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 1 (first sign)
    - 2 (second sign)
    - 3 (third sign)
    - 4 (fourth sign)
    - 5 (fifth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the third test case:
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 1 (first sign)
    - 2 (second sign)
    - 3 (third sign)
    - 4 (fourth sign)
    - 5 (fifth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the fourth test case:
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 50 (first sign)
    - 60 (second sign)
    - 711 (third sign)
    - 800 (fourth sign)
    - 1006 (fifth sign)
    - 2012 (sixth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 2012.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
