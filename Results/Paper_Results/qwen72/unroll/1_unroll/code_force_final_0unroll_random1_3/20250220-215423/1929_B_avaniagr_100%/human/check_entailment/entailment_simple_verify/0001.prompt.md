You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, 2 <= n <= 10^8, and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop iterates over the input test cases and prints the calculated values based on the conditions provided. The variables `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration according to the input test cases, but they are not stored or returned by the function. The state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \) (2n-1 main diagonals from top-left to bottom-right and 2n-1 main diagonals from top-right to bottom-left).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks the value of \( k \) and prints the minimum number of cells to be colored based on the following conditions:
     - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \).

3. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
   - **Condition 2: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( 2n - 1 \).
     - This is because to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals and one of the anti-diagonals, except for one cell. This results in \( 2n - 1 \) cells.
   - **Condition 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( 2n \).
     - This is because to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals and one of the anti-diagonals, which results in \( 2n \) cells.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (4 \leq 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 \leq 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 2 \) (10 = 10), so the program prints \( 2n = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells are needed to cover all 10 diagonals.
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 3 \) (9 = 9), so the program prints \( 2n - 1 = 5 \).
     - This is correct because 5 cells are needed to cover 9 diagonals.
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (7 \leq 12), so the program prints \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).
     - This is correct because 4 cells can cover 7 diagonals.
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (11 \leq 24), so the program prints \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells can cover 11 diagonals.
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 \leq 4), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the minimum number of cells to be colored.
