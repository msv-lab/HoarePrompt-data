Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts cannot be fully accommodated by the available universals. For example, consider the input `1 4 1`:

- `a = 1` (1 introvert)
- `b = 4` (4 extroverts)
- `c = 1` (1 universal)

The program will output `-1` because it checks if `c < b % 3` (which is `1 < 1`), and since this condition is false, it will print `-1`. However, the correct output should be `3` because the 1 introvert can take 1 tent, and the 4 extroverts can be paired with the 1 universal to form 3 tents (1 extrovert alone, 1 tent with 2 extroverts and the universal, and 1 tent with 2 extroverts).

The program fails to correctly account for the possibility of using universals to fulfill the extroverts' requirements, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
