Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has some issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Handling of Universals (c):**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is incorrect because universals can be used to fill different roles, not just as extroverts.
   - The correct approach should consider how universals can be used to balance the needs of introverts and extroverts.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program uses the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` to calculate the number of tents. This is problematic:
     - The expression `a - -b // 3` is not a valid way to calculate the number of tents. The double negation `--` is unnecessary and can be simplified to `a + b // 3`.
     - The condition `c < b % 3` is used to determine if the number of universals is insufficient to accommodate the remaining extroverts, but this is not the correct logic. The correct logic should be to check if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, the solution is impossible.
   - Universals can be used to fill any role, so they should be distributed to minimize the number of tents.

### Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Each introvert needs a separate tent
        tents = a
        
        # Each extrovert needs a tent with two others
        if c >= b:
            # If there are enough universals to pair with extroverts
            tents += b
            c -= b
        else:
            # If there are not enough universals, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired
            if c + (b - c) * 2 < b:
                results.append(-1)
                continue
            else:
                tents += b
                c -= b
        
        # Remaining universals can be paired in groups of 3
        tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Calculating Tents:**
   - Each introvert (`a`) needs a separate tent, so we start with `tents = a`.
   - If there are enough universals (`c >= b`), we can pair each extrovert with two universals, so we add `b` to the tent count and reduce `c` by `b`.
   - If there are not enough universals, we check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with the available universals. If not, we output `-1`.
   - Finally, we distribute the remaining universals in groups of 3, adding `(c + 2) // 3` to the tent count.

This solution correctly handles the problem and ensures that all participants can be accommodated according to their preferences.
