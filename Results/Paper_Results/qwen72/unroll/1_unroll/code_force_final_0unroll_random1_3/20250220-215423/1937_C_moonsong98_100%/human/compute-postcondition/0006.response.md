The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already given as an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, it is guaranteed that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, the loop head initializes `i` to 0, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly mentioned, so we need to ensure that `i` is 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is 0, `i` is 0**
