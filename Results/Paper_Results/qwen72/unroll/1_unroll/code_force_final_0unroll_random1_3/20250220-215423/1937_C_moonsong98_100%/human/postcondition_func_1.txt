The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers less than the size of the permutation `p`. It prints the string `! [a] [b]` to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the values of `a` and `b` respectively. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the permutation `p` is not modified.
