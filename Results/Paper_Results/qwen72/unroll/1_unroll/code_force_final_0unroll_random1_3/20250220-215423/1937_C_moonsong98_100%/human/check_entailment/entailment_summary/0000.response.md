Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in a secret permutation `p` is maximized. The program is allowed to make at most `3n` queries, where each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two elements from the permutation.

### Function Analysis:
1. **`func_1(a, b, c, d)`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives a comparison result.
   - It correctly formats the query and flushes the output buffer, ensuring the query is sent and the result is read.

2. **`func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function outputs the final answer in the required format.
   - It correctly prints the indices `a` and `b` and flushes the output buffer.

3. **`func_3()`**:
   - This function handles the main logic of the problem.
   - For `n = 2`, it directly outputs the indices `0` and `1` because the maximum XOR for any permutation of two elements is always `1`.
   - For `n > 2`, it first finds the index `max_index` such that `p[max_index]` is the maximum value among all elements in the permutation.
   - It then finds the indices `min_indices` where the value of `p[i]` is the minimum among all elements in the permutation, but not equal to `p[max_index]`.
   - Finally, it selects one of the `min_indices` (not equal to `max_index`) and outputs the pair `(max_index, min_index)`.

### Correctness:
- **Finding `max_index`**:
  - The loop iterates through all indices `i` and uses `func_1` to compare `p[0] | p[max_index]` with `p[0] | p[i]`.
  - If `p[0] | p[i]` is greater, `max_index` is updated to `i`.
  - This ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

- **Finding `min_indices`**:
  - The loop iterates through all indices `i` and uses `func_1` to compare `p[max_index] | p[min_indices[0]]` with `p[max_index] | p[i]`.
  - If `p[max_index] | p[i]` is smaller, `min_indices` is updated to `[i]`.
  - If `p[max_index] | p[i]` is equal, `i` is appended to `min_indices`.
  - This ensures that `min_indices` contains the indices of the elements with the smallest value in the permutation, excluding `max_index`.

- **Selecting `min_index`**:
  - The loop iterates through `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `p[min_index] | p[min_index]` with `p[min_index] | p[i]`.
  - If `p[min_index] | p[i]` is equal, `min_index` is updated to `i`.
  - This ensures that `min_index` is one of the indices with the smallest value, but not equal to `max_index`.

- **Output**:
  - The function outputs the pair `(max_index, min_index)` using `func_2`.

### Query Count:
- The function `func_3` makes `n` queries to find `max_index`.
- It then makes `n` queries to find `min_indices`.
- Finally, it makes at most `n` queries to select `min_index`.
- The total number of queries is `3n`, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It finds the indices `i` and `j` such that `p[i] âŠ• p[j]` is maximized and does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
