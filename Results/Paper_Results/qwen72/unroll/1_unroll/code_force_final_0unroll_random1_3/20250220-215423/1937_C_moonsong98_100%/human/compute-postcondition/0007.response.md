To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` and how it affects the variable `max_index`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is initially 0.

The loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
    if res == '<':
        max_index = i
```

The key here is the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`. Since the function is not defined, we need to make an assumption based on the context. The function `func_1` seems to compare `max_index` with `i` and returns a string `<` if `i` is greater than `max_index`.

If `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<` when `i` is greater than `max_index`, then `max_index` will be updated to `i` whenever `i` is greater than the current `max_index`.

Let's analyze the loop:
1. Initially, `max_index` is 0.
2. For each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `i` is greater than `max_index`, `max_index` will be updated to `i`.

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the first time `i` is greater than `max_index` (which is 0 initially) is when `i` is 1. From then on, `max_index` will be updated to the current value of `i` in each iteration where `i` is greater than `max_index`.

By the end of the loop, `max_index` will be the largest value of `i` that was greater than the previous `max_index`, which is `n-1`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`.**
