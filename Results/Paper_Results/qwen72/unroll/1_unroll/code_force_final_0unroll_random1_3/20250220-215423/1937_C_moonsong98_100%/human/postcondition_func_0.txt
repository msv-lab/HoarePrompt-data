The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and prints a query in the format `? [a] [b] [c] [d]` to the standard output. After printing, it flushes the standard output buffer and then reads a line of input from the user, returning this input stripped of any leading and trailing whitespace. The function does not modify the input parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and the final state of the program includes the printed query and the returned user input.
