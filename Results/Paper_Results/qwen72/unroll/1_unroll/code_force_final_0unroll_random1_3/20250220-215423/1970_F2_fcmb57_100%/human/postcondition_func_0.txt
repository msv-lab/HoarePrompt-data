The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples or lists containing two integers each. However, the function results in an error because it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, but `b` is provided as a single integer. As a result, the function does not return any values and the program fails to execute correctly.
