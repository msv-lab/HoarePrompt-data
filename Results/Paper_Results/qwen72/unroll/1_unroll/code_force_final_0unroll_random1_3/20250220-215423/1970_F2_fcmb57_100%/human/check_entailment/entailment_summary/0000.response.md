Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct:

1. **Incorrect Movement Handling for the Quidditch Ball**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to handle movements, but it is defined to accept two tuples or lists of integers. However, the `mouvements` dictionary contains tuples of integers, and the function is called with a single integer for the direction. This will cause an error because the function expects a tuple but receives an integer.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Catching**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who caught the Quidditch ball.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Throwing and Scoring**:
   - The logic for handling the ball throwing and scoring is flawed. The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it does not correctly handle the case where the player throws the ball into the wrong goal. Additionally, the program does not reset the ball's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Handling of Bludger and Player Elimination**:
   - The program checks for player elimination correctly but does not handle the case where the Quidditch ball is left on the field when a player is eliminated while carrying it.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
