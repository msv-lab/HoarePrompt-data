### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to handle the movement of entities (players, balls) on the grid. It takes two parameters: `a` (the current position of the entity) and `b` (the movement direction as a tuple).
   - The function correctly unpacks `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`.
   - It then returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The function summary provided is incorrect. It states that `b` is provided as a single integer, which is not the case in the actual function call. The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions to tuples of integers, and `func_1` is called with these tuples.

2. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to update the player who is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The assessment also correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the program does not check for this condition and will incorrectly update the score.

3. **Additional Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown and remains on the same cell as the Bludger. According to the problem description, if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger. However, the program does not account for this scenario.
   - The program does not correctly reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field when a goal is scored. The Quaffle's position should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but the program only does this for the red player scoring in the red goal. It does not handle the blue player scoring in the blue goal correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and the additional issues found in the reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
