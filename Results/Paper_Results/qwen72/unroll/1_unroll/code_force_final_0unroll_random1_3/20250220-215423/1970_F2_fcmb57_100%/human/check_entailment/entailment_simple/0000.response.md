Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N, M) and initializes the `players`, `goals`, `mouvements`, and `middle` variables.
   - It correctly reads the initial state of the field, setting the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.

2. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to move an entity (player or Quaffle) by one cell in the specified direction.
   - However, there is an error in the function: the tuple `b` (which represents the direction) is unpacked incorrectly. It should be `dx, dy = b`, but the function is written as `dx, dy = b`, which is correct. The comment suggests an error, but the actual code is fine.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For player movements (`'ULDR'`), it updates the player's position and checks for collisions with the Bludger.
   - For catching the Quaffle (`'C'`), it incorrectly uses `==` instead of `=` to assign the player who catches the Quaffle. This is a logical error.
   - For throwing the Quaffle (`'T'`), it correctly updates the Quaffle's state and checks if a goal is scored. However, it does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle and it remains in the same cell (which should not happen according to the problem statement).

4. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - The program correctly prints the elimination of players when they are in the same cell as the Bludger.
   - It correctly prints the scoring events and updates the scores.
   - The final score is printed correctly at the end of the game.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The main logical error is in the catching the Quaffle part: `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
   - The function `func_1` is actually correct, contrary to the comment suggesting an error.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, but the problem statement guarantees that this will not happen.

Given the above points, the program has a logical error in the catching mechanism, which would prevent it from functioning correctly.

Correctness: **False**
