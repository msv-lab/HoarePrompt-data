#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams, respectively.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #An error occurs because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. The program does not return any values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples or lists containing two integers each. However, the function results in an error because it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, but `b` is provided as a single integer. As a result, the function does not return any values and the program fails to execute correctly.
