Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case when \( k \) is less than \( 2n \) but greater than \( n \). In such cases, the program does not ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5
```
The program will output:
```
3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
This is because you can color the cells at positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) to cover 5 diagonals (the two main diagonals and three other diagonals).

The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to color cells to cover the required number of diagonals. It simply divides \( k \) by 2 and rounds up, which does not always ensure the minimum number of cells are colored to meet the requirement.
