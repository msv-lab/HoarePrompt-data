Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the input string, `us` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters that were added when the set `win` had all `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times all `k` unique characters were found in a contiguous subsequence of `s`).**
