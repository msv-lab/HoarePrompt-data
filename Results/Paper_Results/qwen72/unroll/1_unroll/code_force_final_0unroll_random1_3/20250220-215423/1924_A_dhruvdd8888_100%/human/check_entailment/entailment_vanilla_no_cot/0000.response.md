Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The program attempts to build a set `win` of characters seen in the string `s` and clears it once it contains all `k` characters. This approach does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The program does not generate or check all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Output Generation**:
   - If the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, it generates a string by appending characters that are not in `win` and padding with 'a'. This is not a valid approach because it does not ensure that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If all possible strings are subsequences, print "YES".
4. If not, print "NO" and provide one of the strings that is not a subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, possible_string):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - `alphabet` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `all_possible_strings` is a list of all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using these alphabets, generated using `itertools.product`.

2. **Check Subsequence**:
   - The `is_subsequence` function checks if a given string `sub` is a subsequence of `s` by iterating through `s` and checking if all characters in `sub` appear in order.

3. **Main Function**:
   - For each test case, the program generates all possible strings and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` and provides a valid string if not.
