The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. It also accepts a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, where each string represents a row in the transition video plan. The characters in the strings can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided.

The function returns a transition video plan that satisfies the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a symmetric transition video plan. It returns a transition video plan where at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transitions are already decided, and the remaining transitions are filled according to the specified constraints.**
