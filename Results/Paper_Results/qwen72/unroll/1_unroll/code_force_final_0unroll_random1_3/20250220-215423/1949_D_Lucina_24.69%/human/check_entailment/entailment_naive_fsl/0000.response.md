Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always satisfy the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. 

Consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```

The program will output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
F.FSF
FFFF.
```

However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the sequence of transition videos will be: F, F, S, F. This sequence has 3 consecutive F videos, which is more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) transition videos of the same type in a row. This violates the problem's requirement.

The issue arises because the program does not consider the overall sequence of transition videos for all permutations but only focuses on the distribution of F and S videos based on the initial conditions. This approach can lead to sequences that violate the constraint.
