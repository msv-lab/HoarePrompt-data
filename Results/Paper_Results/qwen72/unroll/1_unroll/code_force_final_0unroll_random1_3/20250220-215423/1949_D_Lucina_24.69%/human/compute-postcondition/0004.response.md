The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 and `i` starts from 1. Given the constraints that `2 <= n <= 24`, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once as long as `n` is within this range. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1**
