You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is a list of n strings, each of length n, containing only '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times. During each iteration, it reads `t` lines of input, each line being a string of length `n` containing only '0' or '1'. For each line that contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged, and `a` is decremented by the number of iterations completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `grid`. It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle shape made of '1's, and "square" if the grid contains a square shape made of '1's.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
