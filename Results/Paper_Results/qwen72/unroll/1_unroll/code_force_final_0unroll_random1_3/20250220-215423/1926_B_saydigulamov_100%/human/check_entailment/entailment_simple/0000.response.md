Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by reading the input grid and determining if the shape formed by the '1's is a square or a triangle. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Counting '1's**:
   - The program maintains a list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'.
   - It iterates through each row and appends the count of '1's to `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.

3. **Shape Determination**:
   - After reading the grid and counting the '1's in each row, the program checks the first two elements of `k`.
   - If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Shape Determination Logic**:
  - The logic of checking if `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]` to determine if the shape is a square is incorrect. This check only works for the simplest cases where the shape is either a 2x2 square or a triangle with the first two rows having different counts of '1's.
  - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a sequence where the count of '1's in the i-th row is `2*i - 1` for a right-side-up triangle or `2*(n-i+1) - 1` for an upside-down triangle.
  - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and the total number of rows should be equal to the number of '1's in each row.

### Correctness:
- The program fails to correctly identify shapes in more complex cases. For example, it would incorrectly identify a 3x3 square as a triangle if the first two rows have different counts of '1's.
- The program also does not handle the case where the triangle is upside down, which would require a different sequence of counts.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it relies on a flawed logic for determining the shape. It only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient to correctly identify the shape in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
