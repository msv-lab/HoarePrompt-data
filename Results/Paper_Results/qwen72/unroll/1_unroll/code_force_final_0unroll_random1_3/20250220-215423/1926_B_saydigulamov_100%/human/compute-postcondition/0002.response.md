Output State: **The loop iterates `a` times. During each iteration, it reads `t` lines of input, each line being a string of length `n` containing only '0' or '1'. For each line that contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged, and `a` is decremented by the number of iterations completed.**
