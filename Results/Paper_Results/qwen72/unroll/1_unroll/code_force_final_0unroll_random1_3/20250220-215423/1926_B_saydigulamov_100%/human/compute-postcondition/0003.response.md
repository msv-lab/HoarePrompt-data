The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `grid`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, containing only '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape (either "triangle" or "square") found in the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `grid`. It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle shape made of '1's, and "square" if the grid contains a square shape made of '1's.**
