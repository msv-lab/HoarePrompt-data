### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum number of elements in an array `a` that can be made equal by adding a permutation `p` to `a`.
   - A permutation `p` of length `n` is an array of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - After adding the permutation, we need to count the frequency of each number in the resulting array and find the maximum frequency.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It should then compute the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation to `a`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program includes several functions, but only a few of them are relevant to solving the problem.
   - **`func_1`**: Reads an integer from input. This is likely used to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - **`func_2`**: Reads and maps a list of integers from input. This is likely used to read the array `a`.
   - **`func_4`**: Reads and sorts a list of integers from input. This function could be useful for sorting the array `a`.

4. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **`func_1`**: Correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - **`func_2`**: Correctly reads the array `a` as a list of integers.
   - **`func_4`**: Correctly reads and sorts the array `a`.

5. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not include the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not:
     - Generate or consider any permutations.
     - Add the permutation to the array `a`.
     - Count the frequency of each number in the resulting array.
     - Determine the maximum frequency.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.
