### Reasoning:

1. **Program Structure and Flow:**
   - The program is designed to solve a problem where we need to determine the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation of the same length to the array.
   - The program iterates over multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1()`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case. It returns an integer.
   - **`func_3()`**: This function reads the array `a` for each test case and returns it as a list of integers.
   - **`arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))`**: This line reads the array, removes duplicates, and sorts the remaining elements. This ensures that we only consider unique elements in the array.
   - **`m = max(arr)`**: This line finds the maximum element in the unique and sorted array.
   - **`for i in range(len(arr)):`**: This loop iterates over each unique element in the array.
   - **`a = bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)`**: This line uses binary search to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array. This helps in counting how many elements in the array can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - **`d = a - i`**: This calculates the number of elements in the array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - **`ans = max(ans, d)`**: This updates the maximum count of equal elements found so far.
   - **`print(ans)`**: This prints the result for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the unique elements in the array and sorts them.
   - It then iterates over each unique element and uses binary search to count how many elements can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit, which helps in counting the number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The final result is the maximum count of equal elements found, which is the correct output for the problem.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array has duplicate elements by using `set` to remove duplicates.
   - It also handles the case where the array has a single element or is empty (though the problem guarantees at least one element).

5. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
