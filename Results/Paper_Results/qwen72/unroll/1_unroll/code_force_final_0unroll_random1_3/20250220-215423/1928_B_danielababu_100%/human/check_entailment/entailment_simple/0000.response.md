### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read the number of test cases, which is correct.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`, which is also correct.
   - It then reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which returns a list of integers. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The program converts the array `arr` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it. This step is intended to handle the unique elements in the array, but it may not be necessary for the problem's solution. The problem requires us to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation, and removing duplicates could potentially miss some valid solutions.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted to keep the array sorted. This is used to calculate the difference `d = a - i`, which represents the number of elements in the array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - The program then updates `ans` with the maximum value of `d`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value of `d` for each test case, which is the desired output.

### Issues:
- **Removing Duplicates**: The program removes duplicates from the array using `set`. This is incorrect because the problem requires us to consider all elements in the array, including duplicates. Removing duplicates can lead to an incorrect result if the duplicates are important for achieving the maximum frequency.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we should not remove duplicates from the array. Instead, we should consider all elements and use a different approach to find the maximum frequency. One correct approach is to use a frequency counter and then determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with removing duplicates, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
