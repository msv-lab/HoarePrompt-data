You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of a ribbon, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. The function then prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been handled and the corresponding counts of free cells have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.
   - The array `arr` is read as a string and any spaces are removed.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.

3. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray that contains all the chips and no free cells before the first chip or after the last chip.
   - This subarray `z` is the segment of the ribbon where all chips are located.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z`.
   - The number of free cells in this subarray is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips.
  - By counting the free cells in this segment, it correctly determines the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all chips are already in a single block, the subarray `z` will contain no free cells, and the count will be 0, which is correct.
  - If there are no free cells between the first and last chip, the count will also be 0, which is correct.
  - If there are free cells between the chips, the count will be the number of these free cells, which is the correct number of operations needed.

- **Input and Output Constraints**:
  - The function handles the input constraints correctly, reading `t` test cases and processing each one with the given `n` and `arr`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
