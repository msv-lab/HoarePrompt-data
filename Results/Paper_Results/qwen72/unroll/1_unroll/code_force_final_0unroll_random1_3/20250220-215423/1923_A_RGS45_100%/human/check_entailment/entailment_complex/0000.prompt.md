Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each test case, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged. After all iterations, the loop will have completed its execution, and the final state of `t` will be the same as the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of a ribbon, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. The function then prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been handled and the corresponding counts of free cells have been printed.
