The value of `test_cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is now set to this input value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer, each test case contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, and n integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
