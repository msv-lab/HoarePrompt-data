Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. The function returns the minimum charge required to send all messages in each test case, considering the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`.**
