Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers representing the piles of stones and possibly an integer representing the number of test cases. However, without a proper function definition, the precondition cannot be accurately stated.**

For a more accurate precondition, the function definition should be:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where:
- **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
- **test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of stones in each pile for a given test case.**

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
