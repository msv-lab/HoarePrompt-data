The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `tc` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature, `tc` must be greater than 0**
