Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the string `s`. The current implementation does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could be part of a larger substring.

For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove at least 2 characters, but the correct approach would be to remove the 4th and 9th characters, which are part of the substrings "map" and "pie".

A correct approach would involve checking for the presence of these substrings and ensuring that the minimum number of characters are removed to eliminate them. This can be done using a more sophisticated method, such as iterating through the string and keeping track of the positions where these substrings start and end, and then calculating the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
