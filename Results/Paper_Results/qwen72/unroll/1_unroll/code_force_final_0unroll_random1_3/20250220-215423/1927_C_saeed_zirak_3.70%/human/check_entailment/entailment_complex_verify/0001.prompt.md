You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values for each iteration of the loop, and `a` and `b` are updated with new lists of integers for each iteration. The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and are updated based on the loop logic. After the loop, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will either both be equal to `newk` (k // 2) and the output will be 'yes', or they will not be equal to `newk` and the output will be 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set includes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b` of integers. For each set, it determines if it is possible to select `k // 2` elements from `a` and `k // 2` elements from `b` such that the selected elements are all distinct and are within the first `k` positive integers. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `aOnes` and `bOnes` to 0, which will be used to count the number of elements chosen from arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It also calculates `newk` as `k // 2`, which is the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array.

3. **Loop to Check Elements**:
   - The program iterates from `1` to `k` to check if each integer from `1` to `k` is present in either array `a` or `b`.
   - If an integer `i` is present in both arrays, it increments the count of the array with fewer chosen elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
   - If an integer `i` is present only in array `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If an integer `i` is present only in array `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If an integer `i` is not present in either array, the loop breaks, indicating that it is not possible to choose the required elements.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints "yes"; otherwise, it prints "no".

### Issues:
- **Break Condition**: The program breaks the loop as soon as it encounters an integer `i` that is not present in either array. This is correct because if any integer from `1` to `k` is missing, it is impossible to choose the required elements.
- **Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the elements is correct. It ensures that the elements are chosen from both arrays in a balanced way.
- **Output Case Sensitivity**: The problem description mentions that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). However, the program prints "yes" and "no" in lowercase, which is acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the correct approach to determine if the required elements can be chosen from the arrays.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
