Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. The logic for counting the presence of numbers from 1 to k in arrays `a` and `b` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not ensure that exactly `k/2` numbers are chosen from each array. Instead, it only checks if the numbers from 1 to k are present in either array, which does not guarantee the correct distribution of numbers between the two arrays.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        required = set(range(1, k + 1))
        a_count = 0
        b_count = 0
        newk = k // 2
        
        for i in required:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if a_count < newk and b_count < newk:
                    if a_count <= b_count:
                        a_count += 1
                    else:
                        b_count += 1
                elif a_count < newk:
                    a_count += 1
                elif b_count < newk:
                    b_count += 1
                else:
                    break
            elif i in a and a_count < newk:
                a_count += 1
            elif i in b and b_count < newk:
                b_count += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if a_count == newk and b_count == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Sets for Arrays**: Converts arrays `a` and `b` to sets to efficiently check for the presence of elements.
3. **Required Set**: Creates a set of integers from 1 to k.
4. **Counting Elements**: Iterates through the required set and checks if each element is present in either `a` or `b`. It ensures that exactly `k/2` elements are chosen from each array.
5. **Output**: Prints "yes" if exactly `k/2` elements are chosen from each array, otherwise prints "no".

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks the distribution of elements between the two arrays.
