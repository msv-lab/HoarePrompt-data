The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set includes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b` of integers. For each set, it determines if it is possible to select `k // 2` elements from `a` and `k // 2` elements from `b` such that the selected elements are all distinct and are within the first `k` positive integers. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any values.
