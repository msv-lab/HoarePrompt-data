Output State: **The loop will print the value of `ans` for each iteration of the outer loop, where `ans` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and `m` for each iteration. The values of `n` and `m` will be updated from the input for each iteration of the outer loop, and `count` will be reset to 2 for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop until it reaches 0.**

In more detail:
- `t` will be 0 after all iterations of the outer loop.
- For each iteration of the outer loop, `n` and `m` will be set to the next pair of integers read from the input.
- `count` will be reset to 2 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.
- `ans` will be calculated for each pair of `n` and `m` and printed, but its value will not persist between iterations of the outer loop.
