The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
