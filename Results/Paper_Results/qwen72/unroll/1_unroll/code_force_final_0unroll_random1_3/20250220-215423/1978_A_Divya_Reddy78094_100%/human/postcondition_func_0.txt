The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then prints the sum of the maximum of the first `n-1` elements in `nums` and the last element in `nums`. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state or variables.
