Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book, and an integer `n` representing the number of books, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function returns the total number of pages in all the books combined.**
