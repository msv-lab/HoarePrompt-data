Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined for the given problem. The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, the required number of matching elements `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` themselves.**

For a correct function definition, it should look like this:
```
def count_good_subsegments(t, n, m, k, a, b):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, m, and k are integers where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.**
