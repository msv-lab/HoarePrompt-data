Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `n`.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is correct and useful for mapping indices to letters.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 53 \) followed by "zz".
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of three letters (each with the highest index 26) is 78. If \( n > 52 \), the first letter must be at least 'r' (index 18), and the remaining two letters must be 'z' (index 26) to maximize the sum.
   - **Case 2: \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 28 \) and then 'z'.
     - This is correct because the sum of the first letter 'a' (index 1) and the third letter 'z' (index 26) is 27. Therefore, the second letter must be \( n - 27 \), and the range \( 26 < n \leq 52 \) ensures that \( n - 27 \) is a valid index (1 to 26).
   - **Case 3: \( n \leq 26 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 3 \).
     - This is correct because the sum of the first two letters 'aa' (each with index 1) is 2. Therefore, the third letter must be \( n - 2 \), and the range \( n \leq 26 \) ensures that \( n - 2 \) is a valid index (1 to 26).

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For \( n = 3 \), the word is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
     - For \( n = 78 \), the word is "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

6. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by:
     - Using 'a' as the first letter whenever possible.
     - Using 'z' as the last letter whenever possible to maximize the sum with the smallest possible first and second letters.
     - Using the smallest possible letter for the second position when the first letter is 'a'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
