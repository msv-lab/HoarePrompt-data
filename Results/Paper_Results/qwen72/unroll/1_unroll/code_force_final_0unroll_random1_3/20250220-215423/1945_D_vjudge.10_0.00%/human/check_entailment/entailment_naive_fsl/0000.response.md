Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

**Explanation:**
- Kirill starts at position 6 (end of the queue).
- To move to position 3, Kirill can:
  - Move to position 5 and pay `a_5 = 50` coins.
  - Move to position 4 and pay `a_4 = 40` coins.
  - Move to position 3 and pay `a_3 = 30` coins.
  - Alternatively, he can move to position 5 and pay `a_5 = 50` coins, then move to position 4 and pay `b_4 = 4` coins, and finally move to position 3 and pay `b_3 = 3` coins, which totals to `50 + 4 + 3 = 57` coins.
  - Another optimal way is to move to position 4 and pay `a_4 = 40` coins, then move to position 3 and pay `b_3 = 3` coins, which totals to `40 + 3 = 43` coins.
  - The most optimal way is to move to position 5 and pay `a_5 = 50` coins, then move to position 4 and pay `b_4 = 4` coins, and finally move to position 3 and pay `b_3 = 3` coins, but this is not the minimum cost.

However, the program does not correctly handle the optimal way to move Kirill to position 3. The correct minimum cost is `12` coins, which can be achieved by:
- Moving to position 5 and paying `a_5 = 50` coins.
- Moving to position 4 and paying `b_4 = 4` coins.
- Moving to position 3 and paying `b_3 = 3` coins.

The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `15` coins, which is not the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
