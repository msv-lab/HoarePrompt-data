The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The length of `s` is between 1 and 500 characters. The function is called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and is called within a loop that processes `t` test cases. It returns a result for each test case based on the input binary string `s`.**
