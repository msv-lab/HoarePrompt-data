The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `a`, but the loop condition only depends on `num`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is 0. Since `num` is already a positive integer, it is not equal to 0, and the loop can proceed without any adjustments.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
