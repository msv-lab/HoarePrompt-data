Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.
- The variable `s` is updated in each iteration of the loop, but its new value is determined by the input provided during that iteration. The loop does not enforce any specific final value for `s`, so it can still be any string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The variable `n` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.

The loop processes `n` inputs, and for each input, it checks if the string has exactly 2 distinct characters. If it does, it prints 'NO'. If it doesn't, it prints 'YES' and then either the string in reverse sorted order or the string in sorted order, depending on the original order of the string. However, the loop does not change the values of `t` or `n`, and the final value of `s` is the last input string processed.
