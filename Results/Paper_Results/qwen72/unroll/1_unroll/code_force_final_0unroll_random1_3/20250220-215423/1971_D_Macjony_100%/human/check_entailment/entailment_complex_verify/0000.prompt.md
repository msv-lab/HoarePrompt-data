You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), but this is not reflected in the provided function definition.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user. The loop prints the value of `count` for each iteration, which is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adjusted by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from user input. It then processes each binary string to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1', and adjusts this count by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each binary string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string contains only '1's or only '0's correctly. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's or the string consists of only one type of character), the output should be 1. However, the program increments the count for every transition between different characters, which can lead to incorrect results for strings with only one type of character.

For example, for the input "11111111", the program will output 1, which is correct. However, for the input "00000000", the program will also output 1, which is correct. But for the input "11111111" (or any other string of only '1's), the program will output 1, which is correct. However, the issue arises in the logic where it counts transitions. If the string is "00000000", the program will output 1, which is correct, but the logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the string is already sorted and should always output 1 without counting transitions.

A more robust approach would be to count the number of '0's and '1's and determine the minimum number of pieces based on the transitions between '0' and '1'. If there are no transitions, the output should be 1. If there are transitions, the output should be the number of '1's that appear before any '0' plus 1.
