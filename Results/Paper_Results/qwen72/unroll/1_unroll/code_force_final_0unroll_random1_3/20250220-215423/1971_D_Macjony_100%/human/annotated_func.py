#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), but this is not reflected in the provided function definition.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user. The loop prints the value of `count` for each iteration, which is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adjusted by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from user input. It then processes each binary string to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1', and adjusts this count by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each binary string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user.
