The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer input provided by the user, and `i` is not yet defined. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
