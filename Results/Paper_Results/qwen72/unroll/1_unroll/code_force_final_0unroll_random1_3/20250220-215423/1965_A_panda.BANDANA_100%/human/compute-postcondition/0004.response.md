Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It processes each test case and prints the result to standard output as either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the function. Specifically, 'Alice' is printed if the list of unique pile sizes does not contain 1 or if the list has only one unique pile size. Otherwise, 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on the parity of the index of the first pair of consecutive pile sizes that differ by more than 1, or the parity of the total number of unique pile sizes if no such pair exists. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the output for each test case has been printed to stdout. **
