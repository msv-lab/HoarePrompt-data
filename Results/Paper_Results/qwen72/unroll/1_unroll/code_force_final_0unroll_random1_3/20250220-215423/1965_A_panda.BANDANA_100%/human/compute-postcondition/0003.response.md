The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters but reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output (stdout).

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output.**
