Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), the number of rounds `t` (where t=1), and the edges of the tree, followed by the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and the starting node is one of the nodes in the tree.**
