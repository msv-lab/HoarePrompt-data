### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_4()` for each one. This is correct as it follows the problem's input format.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from input and performs initial checks:
     - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, which is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
     - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
       - For odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
       - For even `n`, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
     - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, which is correct because no permutation can have a Manhattan value greater than `max_k`.
     - If `k` is within the valid range, it returns `n` and `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`:
     - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
     - It iterates over the list in reverse order, moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`:
       - If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l` as is.
       - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` and returns the modified list.
       - Otherwise, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and updates `k` to `k - i + 1`.
     - This approach is correct because it ensures that the Manhattan value of the permutation is exactly `k`.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints the result:
     - If a valid permutation is found, it prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
     - If no valid permutation is found, it prints "NO".
   - This is correct as it follows the problem's output format.

5. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process:
     - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
     - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
   - This is correct as it ensures that the program handles both valid and invalid cases properly.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, performs the necessary checks, generates the permutation, and prints the result in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
