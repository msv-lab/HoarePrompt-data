Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test` where each tuple contains three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.

2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. This is correct because in chess, each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) always results in an even number of points being distributed (2 points for a win/loss, 1 point each for a draw).

3. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.

4. **Invalid Conditions Check**: The program checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. This is not entirely correct. The condition `total_matchs > 3` is unnecessary because the number of matches can be greater than 3. For example, if all three players have 10 points each, the total number of matches is 15, which is valid. The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is correct because the highest score `p3` cannot be greater than the total number of matches.

5. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This is an attempt to account for the points that could have been distributed through wins/losses and then determine the remaining points that must have come from draws. However, this formula is not entirely correct. The correct formula should be:
   - `draws = (total_points - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)) // 2`
   - This is because the points from wins/losses are `p3 - p2` and `p3 - p1` (the differences in points between the highest scorer and the other two players), and the remaining points must have come from draws.

6. **Output**: The program appends the number of draws to the `resultats` list. If the number of draws is negative, it appends -1, which is correct because a negative number of draws is not possible.

Given the above points, the program has a logical error in the draw calculation and an unnecessary condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
