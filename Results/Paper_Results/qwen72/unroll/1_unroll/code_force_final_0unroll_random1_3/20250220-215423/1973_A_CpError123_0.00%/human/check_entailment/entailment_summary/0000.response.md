### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the input by defining the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `cas_de_test`.
   - It processes each test case and appends the result to the `resultats` list.
   - The final results are printed, one per line, which matches the expected output format.

2. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points for each test case using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - It checks if the total points are odd (`total_points % 2 != 0`). If so, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because it is impossible to have more than 3 matches or a score higher than the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - It checks if the number of draws is negative (`egalites < 0`). If so, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because a negative number of draws is not possible.
   - Otherwise, it appends the number of draws divided by 2 (`egalites // 2`) to `resultats`.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `(0, 0, 0)`, the total points are 0, which is even, and no matches were played, so the number of draws is 0.
   - For the test case `(0, 1, 1)`, the total points are 2, which is even, and the only way to achieve this is with one draw.
   - For the test case `(0, 2, 3)`, the total points are 5, which is odd, so the result is -1.
   - For the test case `(3, 3, 3)`, the total points are 9, which is odd, so the result is -1.
   - For the test case `(3, 4, 5)`, the total points are 12, which is even, and the number of draws is 6.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 10)`, the total points are 12, which is even, and the number of draws is 2.
   - For the test case `(0, 0, 6)`, the total points are 6, which is even, and the number of draws is 3.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent. However, there is a logical error in the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` which should be `if total_matchs > 3 * t or p3 > total_matchs` to account for the number of test cases. Additionally, the formula for calculating draws should be re-evaluated to ensure it is correct for all cases.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the condition for checking the total number of matches and the formula for calculating the number of draws. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program works correctly for all test cases.
