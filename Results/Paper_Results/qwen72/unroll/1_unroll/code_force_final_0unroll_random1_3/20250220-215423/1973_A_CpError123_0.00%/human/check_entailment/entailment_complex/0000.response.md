Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function correctly checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). This is necessary because in a valid set of games, the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either 2 for a win/loss or 1 for each player in a draw).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.

3. **Invalid Conditions**:
   - The function checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 (`if total_matchs > 3`). This is incorrect because there is no upper limit on the number of matches that can be played. The number of matches can be any non-negative integer, and the constraint on the points (0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30) does not imply a limit on the number of matches.
   - The function also checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This is correct because the highest score (p3) cannot be greater than the total number of matches, as each match can only contribute up to 2 points.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the possible distribution of points between wins, losses, and draws.
   - The correct formula for the maximum number of draws should be derived from the total points and the distribution of points among the players. Specifically, the maximum number of draws is the total number of matches minus the number of wins (since each win contributes 2 points and each draw contributes 1 point to each player).

5. **Output**:
   - The function appends the result to the `resultats` list, which is then returned. This part is correct.

Given the issues with the conditions and the draws calculation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
