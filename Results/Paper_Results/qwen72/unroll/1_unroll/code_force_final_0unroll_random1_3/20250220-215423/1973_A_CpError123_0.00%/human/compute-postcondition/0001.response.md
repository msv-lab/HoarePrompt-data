The only objects in the loop head are the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the list `cas_de_test`. The loop will execute if `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple. The initial state of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `cas_de_test` at the start of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be the first tuple's values.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first integer in the first tuple, `p2` is the second integer in the first tuple, `p3` is the third integer in the first tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**
