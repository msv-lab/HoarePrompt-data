You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be defined with parameters to handle the problem, but the provided function definition is incomplete. Typically, the function should take a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, an integer `n` representing the number of cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The ratings list `a` should contain `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9, and `k` should be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))

            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:

        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the function prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before the cow at index `k` (after the swap operations) such that the ratings of these cows are not greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` are updated and reset for each test case, but the overall state of the program remains ready to handle the next test case until all `t` test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, an integer `n` for the number of cows, and an integer `k` for the index of your cow. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before the cow at index `k` such that their ratings are not greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. The function does not return any value but modifies and resets its internal variables for each test case, ensuring it is ready to process the next test case until all `t` test cases are completed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `s`.

2. **Initial Swap:**
   - The program swaps the rating of your cow with the first cow in the list.
   - This is done to simulate the scenario where your cow is in the first position.

3. **First Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of matches your cow wins.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the first cow (which is now your cow's rating).
   - It iterates through the list `s[1:]` to simulate the matches.
   - If your cow's rating `h` is greater than the current opponent's rating, it increments `ans` and continues.
   - If your cow's rating is less than the current opponent's rating, it breaks the loop.
   - It stores the index of the last match your cow won in `p`.

4. **Revert Swap:**
   - The program reverts the initial swap to restore the original list.

5. **Optimal Swap:**
   - The program swaps your cow's rating with the cow at position `p` (the last position where your cow won in the first simulation).
   - This is done to simulate the scenario where your cow is placed in the optimal position to maximize wins.

6. **Second Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0, which will count the number of matches your cow wins in the second simulation.
   - It sets `z` to 0, which will be used to track if your cow has already been encountered in the list.
   - It iterates through the list `s` to simulate the matches.
   - If the current cow is your cow and it is not in the first position, it increments `ans1`.
   - If the current cow's rating is greater than your cow's rating `h`, it breaks the loop.
   - If the current cow is your cow and it is in the first position, it sets `z` to 1.
   - If `z` is 1 and the current cow's rating is less than your cow's rating, it increments `ans1`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins between the two simulations (`max(ans, ans1)`).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the two scenarios: one where your cow is in the first position and one where your cow is in the optimal position to maximize wins.
- The logic for counting wins is correct in both simulations.
- The program handles the constraints and input format as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and logic to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
