Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be defined with parameters to handle the problem, but the provided function definition is incomplete. Typically, the function should take a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, an integer `n` representing the number of cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The ratings list `a` should contain `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9, and `k` should be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
