The function `func` is expected to accept multiple parameters to handle the problem described. Specifically, it should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it should accept an integer `n` representing the number of cows, an integer `k` representing the index of your cow, and a list of integers `a` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The list `a` should contain `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9, and `k` should be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function should return the result for each test case, which is the rating of the cow at index `k` in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` for the number of test cases, an integer `n` for the number of cows, an integer `k` for the index of your cow, and a list of integers `a` for the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. For each test case, it returns the rating of the cow at index `k` in the list `a`.**
