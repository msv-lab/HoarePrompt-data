Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking certain conditions in the grid, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the conditions in the `if` statement are not sufficient to cover all scenarios where the robot might be blocked from reaching the target cell.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Blocking**: The program checks if `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, but this does not correctly identify all cases where the robot might be blocked. For example, it does not consider the possibility of the robot being blocked by arrows in the same row or by the way the robot moves.

2. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The program prints 'No' and 'yes', which should be 'NO' and 'YES' to match the problem's output requirements.

3. **Logic for Movement**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement correctly. It should consider the robot's movement in both steps (the robot's move and the arrow's move) to determine if it can reach the target cell.

A correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement step by step and checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        row, col = 1, 1
        visited = set()
        
        while col <= n:
            if (row, col) in visited:
                print('NO')
                break
            visited.add((row, col))
            
            if row == 1:
                if a[col - 1] == '<':
                    col = max(1, col - 1)
                else:
                    col = min(n, col + 1)
            else:
                if b[col - 1] == '<':
                    col = max(1, col - 1)
                else:
                    col = min(n, col + 1)
            
            if col == n and row == 2:
                print('YES')
                break
            
            if a[col - 1] == '<' and b[col - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
            
            if row == 1:
                row = 2
            else:
                row = 1
        else:
            print('NO')

can_reach_target()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n) by following the rules specified in the problem. It also ensures that the output is in the correct case ('YES' or 'NO').
