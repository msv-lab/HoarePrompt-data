You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly n characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. t must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `n` and the list of tuples containing the strings of arrows for each test case remain unchanged. The loop prints 'No' or 'yes' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it prints 'No' if there is a position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, and 'yes' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly `n` characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to navigate from the leftmost column to the rightmost column in the grid for each test case. If `t` is out of the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, or any `n` is out of the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, or `n` is not even, or the sum of all `n` values exceeds 2 · 10^5, the function's behavior is undefined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
