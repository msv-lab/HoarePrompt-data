### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it chooses a direction (left, right, up, or down), and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the input includes the number of columns `n`, the arrows in the first row `a`, and the arrows in the second row `b`.
   - The output should be "YES" if the robot can reach cell (2, n), and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must move to the right to reach the target cell (2, n), as it starts at (1, 1).
   - The robot can only move to the right if the arrows in the current and next cells allow it.
   - Specifically, if the robot is in the first row and encounters a '<' arrow, it must move to the second row to continue moving right.
   - Similarly, if the robot is in the second row and encounters a '<' arrow, it must move to the first row to continue moving right.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the arrows in the first row `a`, and the arrows in the second row `b`.
   - The program then iterates over the columns in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1).
   - It checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can be blocked from moving to the right:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', the robot will be stuck in a loop between these two cells.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', the robot will be stuck in a loop between these two cells.
   - If either of these conditions is met, the program prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any blocking conditions, the program prints "yes".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can be blocked from moving to the right.
   - However, the program prints "No" and "yes" in lowercase, which does not match the problem description that states the output can be in any case (e.g., "YES", "Yes", "YeS").
   - The logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is correct, but the output format is not.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is correct, but the output format is incorrect. The program should print "NO" and "YES" to meet the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
