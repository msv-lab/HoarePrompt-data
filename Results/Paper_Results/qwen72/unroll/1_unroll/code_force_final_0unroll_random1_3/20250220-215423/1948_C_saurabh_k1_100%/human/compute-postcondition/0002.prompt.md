Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the user, `n` is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. `t` must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each `n` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` is even, and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
