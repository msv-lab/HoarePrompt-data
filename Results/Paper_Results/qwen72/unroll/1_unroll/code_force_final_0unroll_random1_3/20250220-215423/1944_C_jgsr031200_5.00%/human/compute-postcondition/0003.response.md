To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value. Here, `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, and `start` is 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `nums` and `start`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is 0.
   - `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`.
   - The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
- Since `start` is 0, `nums.get(0, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
- This means that the integer 0 must be present in `arr` with a frequency count greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- The initial state of `nums` must be such that `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr` and `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
