Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the closest city is equidistant to two cities. According to the problem description, the closest city is unique for every city, but the program's logic does not ensure this uniqueness. For example, consider the cities located at points `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. The closest city to city 2 (at point 1) should be city 1 (at point 0) or city 3 (at point 2), but the program will only consider one of them, leading to incorrect results for queries involving city 2.

Additionally, the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between cities is flawed. The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city from the left and right, respectively. However, the way these costs are calculated and used in the queries does not correctly handle all possible scenarios.

For instance, consider the cities located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]` and the query `(1, 4)`. The program calculates the cost as `d1[4] - d1[1]`, but this does not account for the possibility of traveling directly to the closest city and then to the target city, which might be cheaper. The correct minimum cost for this query should be 3 coins (as described in the example), but the program's logic might not always produce this result.
