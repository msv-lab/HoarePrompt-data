You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The output state is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has been executed for each test case, and the results of the queries have been printed. The variables `d1` and `d2` will have been populated with the calculated distances for each city, but these are not part of the initial state and are not required to be described in the output state. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `m` will have been processed, and the input for the next test case will be ready to be read.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `l`.
   - It initializes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.

2. **Forward Direction Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `d1[2]` to 1, which is correct because the closest city to the second city is the first city, and the cost is 1 coin.
   - It then iterates through the cities from the second to the second-to-last city.
   - For each city `i + 1`, it checks if the distance to the next city `i + 2` is less than the distance to the previous city `i`.
     - If true, it sets `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, meaning the cost to travel to the next closest city is 1 coin plus the cost to travel to the current city.
     - If false, it sets `d1[i + 2]` to the distance between the current city and the next city plus the cost to travel to the current city.

3. **Backward Direction Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `d2[n - 1]` to 1, which is correct because the closest city to the second-to-last city is the last city, and the cost is 1 coin.
   - It then iterates through the cities from the second-to-last to the second city.
   - For each city `i`, it checks if the distance to the previous city `i - 1` is less than the distance to the next city `i + 1`.
     - If true, it sets `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]`, meaning the cost to travel to the previous closest city is 1 coin plus the cost to travel to the next city.
     - If false, it sets `d2[i]` to the distance between the current city and the previous city plus the cost to travel to the next city.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `m`.
   - For each query, it reads the cities `x` and `y`.
   - It then prints the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y`:
     - If `y > x`, it uses `d1[y] - d1[x]` to calculate the cost.
     - If `y < x`, it uses `d2[y] - d2[x]` to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
- **Initialization of `d1` and `d2`:**
  - The program initializes `d1[2]` and `d2[n - 1]` to 1, which is incorrect. The closest city to the second city is the first city, and the cost should be 1 coin. However, `d1[2]` should be initialized to 1, and `d2[n - 1]` should be initialized to 1.
  - The program should initialize `d1[1]` and `d2[n]` to 0 because the cost to travel from the first city to itself or from the last city to itself is 0.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in the forward and backward directions is incorrect. The program should not accumulate the distances directly but should instead use the minimum cost to travel to the closest city.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize dictionaries to store the minimum cost to travel to the next closest city
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Forward direction
        d1[1] = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i]
        
        # Backward direction
        d2[n] = 0
        for i in range(n - 1, 1, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i - 1] = 1 + d2[i]
            else:
                d2[i - 1] = l[i] - l[i - 1]
        
        m = int(input())
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[x] - d2[y])
