Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the MEX Function**:
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of a sequence of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - The array `a` is constructed such that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It then constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` and prints it.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes a variable `minn` to 0, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the elements that have already been used in the permutation `p`.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means `p[i]` is the current MEX value, which is `minn`.
       - The program appends `minn` to the `mex` list.
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused value.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - The program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
       - It marks `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used in the `used` dictionary.

5. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should handle up to `10^4` test cases and `n` up to `2 * 10^5` efficiently.

7. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX function.
   - The output matches the expected format and constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
