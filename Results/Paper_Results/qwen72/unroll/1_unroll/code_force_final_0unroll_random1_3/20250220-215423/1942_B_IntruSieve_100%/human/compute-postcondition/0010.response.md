The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns a list of integers that represents a valid permutation `p` of the input list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of valid permutations for each test case.**
