Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The key points to verify are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `a`.

2. **MEX Calculation and Permutation Construction**:
   - The program maintains a list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have already been used in the permutation.
   - The variable `minn` is used to find the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`, which is the MEX of the current prefix of `p`.

3. **Logic for Constructing `mex`**:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used. This is correct because if `a[i] > 0`, then `p[i]` must be the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of `p`.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and marks this value as used. This is correct because if `a[i] <= 0`, then `p[i]` must be the value that, when subtracted from the MEX of the current prefix, gives `arr[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` for each test case, which should be the permutation `p`.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic when `arr[i] <= 0`:
- The program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and adds this value to `mex`. This assumes that `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is the correct value to be added to `mex`, but this is not always true. The correct value should be `minn - arr[i]` because `arr[i]` is the difference between the MEX and `p[i]`.

Let's correct the logic for the case when `arr[i] <= 0`:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(minn - arr[i])
            used[minn - arr[i]] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases.

Correctness: **True** (after the correction mentioned above)
