The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function `R` is not used in the snippet, so it does not affect the initial state variables. The initial state variables `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lambda function `R` is defined but not used.**
