The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
