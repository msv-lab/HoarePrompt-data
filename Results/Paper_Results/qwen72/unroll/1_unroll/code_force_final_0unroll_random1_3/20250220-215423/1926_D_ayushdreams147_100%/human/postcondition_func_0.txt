The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function also maintains a dictionary `count` where the keys are the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1`, and the values are the counts of these complements. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a`. The dictionary `count` contains the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.
