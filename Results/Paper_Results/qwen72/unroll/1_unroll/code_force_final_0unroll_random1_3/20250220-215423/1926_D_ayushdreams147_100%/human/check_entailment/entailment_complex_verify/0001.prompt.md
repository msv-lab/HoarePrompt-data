You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary containing the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function also maintains a dictionary `count` where the keys are the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1`, and the values are the counts of these complements. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a`. The dictionary `count` contains the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to divide a list of integers into groups such that for any two numbers in the same group, their 31 least significant bits do not match.
   - This means that for any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x_2(i) \neq y_2(i) \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq 31 \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) have the same 31 least significant bits, they cannot be in the same group.
   - Therefore, the number of groups required is at least the number of unique 31-bit patterns in the list.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers \( a \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, a)` to determine the minimum number of groups required.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of groups.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the count of each 31-bit pattern.
   - For each number \( num \) in the list \( a \):
     - It checks if \( num \) is not in the `count` dictionary.
     - If \( num \) is not in the dictionary, it adds the complement of \( num \) (i.e., \( (1 << 31) - 1 \) XOR \( num \)) to the dictionary and increments `res`.
     - If \( num \) is in the dictionary, it decrements the count of \( num \) in the dictionary.
     - If the count of \( num \) becomes 0, it deletes \( num \) from the dictionary.

5. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly uses the complement of \( num \) (i.e., \( (1 << 31) - 1 \) XOR \( num \)) to determine the groups.
   - The correct approach should be to count the unique 31-bit patterns directly, not their complements.
   - The logic of decrementing the count and deleting the number from the dictionary is flawed. It does not ensure that the numbers are grouped correctly.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we should count the unique 31-bit patterns in the list.
   - The number of unique patterns will be the minimum number of groups required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses the complement of the numbers to determine the groups, which does not align with the problem's requirement. The correct approach should be to count the unique 31-bit patterns directly.
