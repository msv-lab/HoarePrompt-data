### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads `m` queries, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the next city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward travel costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward travel costs.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward travel costs, but the cities list is reversed before calling `func_1`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f`.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b`.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city. However, the logic is flawed:
     - The condition `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i + 1]` is always true because `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`.
     - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is incorrect because it should be checking the distance to the closest city, not just the next or previous city.
     - The function should return the cost of traveling to the closest city, but it is returning a list of distances or 1s, which is not correct.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect output of `func_1`.
   - The prefix sum for `pref_sum_b` is calculated after reversing the cities list, which is a good approach to handle backward travel, but the function `func_1` is still incorrect.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic is correct in terms of using the prefix sums, but the prefix sums themselves are based on incorrect data.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the program will not correctly determine the cost of traveling to the closest city, and thus the prefix sums and query results will be incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
