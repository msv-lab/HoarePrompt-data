### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The `cities` list is converted to a list of integers and is processed in both forward and backward directions to determine the closest city for each city.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - For each city `i`, it compares the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is less, it sets the cost to 1 (indicating a travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city.
   - The function returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers, where each integer represents the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city except the last one.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to store the cumulative costs of traveling to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum `pref_sum_f`.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum `pref_sum_b`.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the respective indices.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the cities are in strictly ascending order and the closest city is unique for each city.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the cities are reversed to compute the backward prefix sums.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Distance Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the distance calculation. Specifically, the condition `if i < n - 1` is always true for `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, and the distance to the next city is always calculated as `forward = cities[i + 1]`.
  - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is incorrect because it should be comparing the distance to the next city with the distance to the previous city, not the current city.
  - The correct condition should be `if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])`.

- **Incorrect Cost Assignment:**
  - The cost assignment in `func_1` is incorrect. If the distance to the next city is less, the cost should be 1. If the distance to the previous city is less, the cost should be the distance to the previous city.
  - The correct assignment should be:
    ```python
    if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
    ```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program contains logical errors in the `func_1` function that affect the correctness of the prefix sum calculations and, consequently, the query results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    cities.reverse()
    backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(a), int(b))
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[a - 1] - pref_sum_b[b - 1])

def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        forward = 99999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: False** due to the logical errors in the `func_1` function.
