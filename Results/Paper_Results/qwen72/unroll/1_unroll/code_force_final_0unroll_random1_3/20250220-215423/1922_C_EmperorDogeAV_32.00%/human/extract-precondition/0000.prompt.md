You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .
Function definition:
```
def func_1(cities, n):
```
