The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should accept a parameter `t` (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4) and a list of lists `p` where each sublist `p_i` contains four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. The function's output is not specified, but given the context, it likely processes these inputs to return some result based on the counts of the numbers in each sequence.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `p`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each `p_i` in `p` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. The function returns a result based on the input sequences, but the specific output is not provided.**
