Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). It then calculates a value `year` by summing `year % ai or ai` for each `ai` in the list `a`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer received, and `a` is the last list of integers received. The variable `year` holds the final calculated value for the last test case. **
