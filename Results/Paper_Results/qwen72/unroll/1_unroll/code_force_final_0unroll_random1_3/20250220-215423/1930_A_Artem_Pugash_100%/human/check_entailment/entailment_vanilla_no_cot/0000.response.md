Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
3. **Scoring**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score. This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum of each pair will always be the smaller index element.
4. **Output**: The final score for each test case is printed.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized by always selecting the smallest available number in each move, which is the optimal strategy for this problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
