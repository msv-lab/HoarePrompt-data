Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the integers for each test case. This is evident from the use of `int(input())` to get the number of test cases and the subsequent loop to process each test case. Inside the loop, it reads `n` and the list of 2n integers, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers using `sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`. Sorting the list in non-decreasing order is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first when forming pairs. This is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Pair Selection**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2 using `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. During each iteration, it adds the element at index `i` (which is the first element of each pair in the sorted list) to the score. This is the correct approach because the first element of each pair is guaranteed to be the smaller of the two, and by summing these, we maximize the score.

4. **Output**: The final score is printed for each test case using `print(score)`. This is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

The key insight is that by sorting the list and always selecting the first element of each pair, the program ensures that the smallest possible values are added to the score, which maximizes the score. This approach is optimal and works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as when all numbers are the same or when the numbers are in a random order.

The annotated code confirms that the function reads input correctly, processes each test case independently, and prints the correct score for each test case. The state of the program and the variables are managed correctly, with `score` being reset for each test case.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
