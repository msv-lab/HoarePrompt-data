Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest available numbers together to ensure that the minimum values are as large as possible.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the list of numbers ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first.
   - By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element (starting from the first element), we effectively pair the smallest numbers together and add the smaller of each pair to the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - It reads the value of n.
     - It reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
     - It initializes the score to 0.
     - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
     - It prints the score.

4. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - `for _ in range(int(input())):`: This loop runs for the number of test cases.
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the value of n for the current test case.
   - `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`: Reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
   - `score = 0`: Initializes the score to 0.
   - `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`: Iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element).
   - `score += l[i]`: Adds the current element to the score.
   - `print(score)`: Prints the final score for the current test case.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the list and taking every second element (starting from the first) is correct because it ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number in each pair to the score.
   - This strategy guarantees that we maximize the score because the smallest numbers are used first, which is optimal for the problem.
   - The code correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
   - The annotated version confirms that the function processes each test case independently, resets the score for each test case, and prints the correct result.

Given the above reasoning and the annotated version, the provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
