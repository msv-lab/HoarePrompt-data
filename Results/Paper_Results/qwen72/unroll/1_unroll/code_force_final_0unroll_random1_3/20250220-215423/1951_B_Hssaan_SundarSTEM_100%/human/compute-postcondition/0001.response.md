Output State: **The loop will execute for `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the maximum number of cows that can be placed before your cow (at index `k`) in the list `ratings` such that all these cows have a rating less than or equal to your cow's rating. The list `ratings` and the index `k` will not be modified after the loop execution.**
