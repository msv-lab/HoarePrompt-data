The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, for each test case, and an additional parameter `t` that specifies the number of test cases. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
