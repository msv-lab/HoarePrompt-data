### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine the k-th card laid down.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a list `L` to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It iterates while `n` is greater than 0:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current step.
     - `n` is reduced by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
     - `m` is appended to the list `L`.
   - The program then iterates over the list `L` to find the k-th card:
     - `tot` keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down so far.
     - `pow` is a multiplier that starts at 1 and is doubled in each step to account for the increasing multiples (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
     - If `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in the current step (`tot < k and k <= tot + a`), the program prints the k-th card as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
     - `tot` is updated to include the current step's cards.
     - `pow` is doubled for the next step.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of odd-numbered cards in each step and reduces `n` accordingly.
   - The program correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down and calculates the card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly generates the k-th card in the sequence by considering the current step's multiplier and the position within that step.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The program handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly by ensuring the last card is laid down in the appropriate step.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 * 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) by using a while loop to reduce `n` and a for loop to find the k-th card.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
