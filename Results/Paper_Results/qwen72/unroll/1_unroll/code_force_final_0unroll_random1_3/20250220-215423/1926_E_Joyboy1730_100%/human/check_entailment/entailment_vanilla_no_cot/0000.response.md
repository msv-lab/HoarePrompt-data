Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by determining the order in which cards are laid down and then finds the k-th card laid down. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to keep track of the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly calculate the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is appended to `L`, and `n` is updated by subtracting the number of cards laid down.
3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - It initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1. `tot` keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down so far, and `pow` is used to determine the multiplier for the current step.
   - It iterates through the list `L` to find the step where the k-th card is laid down. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it prints the k-th card, which is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It updates `tot` and `pow` for the next iteration.

The program correctly handles the order of laying down cards and the calculation of the k-th card, ensuring that it matches the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
