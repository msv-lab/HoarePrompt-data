The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function then calculates a sequence of values based on `n` and `k`, and prints a specific value derived from these calculations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate values have been printed.
