The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8. `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a value indicating the configuration or count of colored cells in a square grid of size `n` such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.**
