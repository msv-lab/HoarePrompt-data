Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the condition and the formula used to calculate the number of cells to be colored. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `k == 1` and prints `1` if true. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, one cell is sufficient.
   - The program then checks if `k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2))`. This condition is incorrect. The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \), and the condition should be based on this total number of diagonals.

2. **Formula for Minimum Cells**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can affect at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - For \( k > 2n - 1 \), the program uses \( k // 2 + 1 \). This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should account for the fact that once \( k \) exceeds \( 2n - 1 \), additional cells are needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

The correct approach should be:
- For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
- For \( k > 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells required is \( n + (k - (2n - 1)) \).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(n + (k - (2 * n - 1)))

func()
```

This program correctly handles the conditions and calculates the minimum number of cells required to color the grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
