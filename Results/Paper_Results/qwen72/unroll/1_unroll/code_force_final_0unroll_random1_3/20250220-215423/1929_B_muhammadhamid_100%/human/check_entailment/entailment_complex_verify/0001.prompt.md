You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each pair of inputs (n, k) provided. For each pair, if k is 1, the output will be 1. If k is between 2 and 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output will be the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output will be k divided by 2, rounded down, plus 1. The loop will continue to execute until all input pairs have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through user input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. For each pair, it outputs the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition. If `k` is 1, the output is 1. If `k` is between 2 and 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2. If `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output is `k` divided by 2, rounded down, plus 1. The function continues processing until all input pairs have been handled.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Special Case: \( k = 1 \)**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
   - This is handled correctly by the program with `if k == 1: print(1)`.

3. **General Case: \( 1 < k \leq 4n - 2 \)**
   - The program checks if \( k \) is within the range \( 1 < k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), which simplifies to \( 1 < k \leq 4n - 4 \).
   - If \( k \) is within this range, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 4 \), it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

4. **Correctness of the General Case:**
   - For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the program uses `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the program uses `k // 2 + 1`. This is because when \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 4 \), we need to cover more than half of the diagonals, and the additional `+1` ensures that we cover the remaining diagonals.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case \( k = 1 \) correctly.
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program should print \( n \) because coloring the entire diagonal (either main or anti-diagonal) will cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. However, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`, which is \( 2n - 1 \). This is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program fails to handle the edge case where \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. It should print \( n \) instead of \( 2n - 1 \).
