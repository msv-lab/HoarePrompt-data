The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n` is a positive integer, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9. The parameters `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are also positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.

The function returns one of two cases:
- **Case_1**: If the function can partition the list `numbers` into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) such that:
  - `group_a` contains the largest `na` elements,
  - `group_b` contains the next largest `nb` elements,
  - `group_c` contains the smallest `nc` elements,
  and the sums of the elements in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`, then the function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- **Case_2**: If the function cannot partition the list `numbers` in a way that satisfies the above conditions, it returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the list `numbers` can be partitioned into three groups with the largest `na` elements, the next largest `nb` elements, and the smallest `nc` elements, and the sums of these groups satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`. If such a partition is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
