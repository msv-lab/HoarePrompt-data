The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns the tuple (1, 0).
- **Case_2**: The function returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`. This case applies when `a` is less than `b`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, minus one. This case applies when `a` is divisible by `b`.
- **Case_4**: The function returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by calling `func_1(b, a % b)`. This case applies in all other scenarios.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1) (1, 0) if a specific condition is met, (2) the results of `func_1(b, a)` if `a` is less than `b`, (3) (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` is divisible by `b`, or (4) `d` and `c - a // b * d` where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)` in all other cases.**
