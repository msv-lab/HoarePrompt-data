### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not match the problem description and do not solve the problem of counting the number of different permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires a function to count the number of different permutations of length `n` that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The output should be the count of such permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function appears to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - The function does not directly handle permutations or the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**:
     - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Again, this function does not handle permutations or the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires a function that can determine the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The provided functions are not designed to solve this problem. They are more suited for tasks involving modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example provided, the correct solution involves a different approach, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial counting, to determine the number of valid permutations.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not provide any mechanism to count permutations based on the given indices.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
