You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the values 1 and 0.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`, the specific values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b.
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus one. Given that a is divisible by b, the quotient (a // b) is an integer, and the second value will be a negative integer.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0.
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is an integer, and the result of `c - a // b * d` is also an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1) (1, 0) if a specific condition is met, (2) the results of `func_1(b, a)` if `a` is less than `b`, (3) (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` is divisible by `b`, or (4) `d` and `c - a // b * d` where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)` in all other cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the values 1 and 0.

Case_2: The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`, the specific values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus one. Given that a is divisible by b, the quotient (a // b) is an integer, and the second value will be a negative integer.

Case_4: The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is an integer, and the result of `c - a // b * d` is also an integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
