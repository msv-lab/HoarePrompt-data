Output State: **The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`, the specific values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`.**
