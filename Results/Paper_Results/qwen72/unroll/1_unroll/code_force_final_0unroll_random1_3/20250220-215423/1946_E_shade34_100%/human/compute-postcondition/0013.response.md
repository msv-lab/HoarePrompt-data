Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of two integers based on the following conditions: (1) If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). (2) If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the results of `func_1(b, a)` but swaps the order of the returned values. (3) If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, minus one. (4) In all other cases, it returns the second value from `func_1(b, a % b)` and a computed value based on the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. **
