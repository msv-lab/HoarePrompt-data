### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200002` and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for calculating combinations (binomial coefficients) efficiently, which are used in the main logic to determine the number of valid permutations.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the indices of the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Validity Check:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is `1`, and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints `0` because the permutation cannot be valid under these conditions.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses a combination function `func_2` to calculate the number of ways to place elements in the permutation. The combination function `func_2` is based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (implemented in `func_1`) to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `1000000007`.

5. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates through the suffix maximums `s` and calculates the number of ways to place elements in the gaps between the suffix maximums. It updates the answer `ans` by multiplying it with the combination values and taking the result modulo `1000000007`.

6. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program processes the prefix maximums `p` in reverse order (excluding the last element, which is already checked). It calculates the number of ways to place elements in the gaps between the prefix maximums and updates the answer `ans` similarly.

7. **Final Permutations Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the answer `ans` by the factorials of the gaps between the prefix maximums and the gaps between the suffix maximums. This accounts for the internal permutations within these gaps.

8. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1(a, b)`:**
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `1000000007`. The function is based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is a standard method for finding the modular inverse. The function returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` is the modular inverse of `b` and `d` is an auxiliary value that is not used in the main logic.

- **`func_2(a, b)`:**
  - This function calculates the combination `C(a, b)` using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse computed by `func_1`. It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the modular inverse of `b`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The combination calculations and the modular arithmetic are handled appropriately, and the program ensures that the constraints are met before proceeding with the calculations.

Therefore, the program is correct.
