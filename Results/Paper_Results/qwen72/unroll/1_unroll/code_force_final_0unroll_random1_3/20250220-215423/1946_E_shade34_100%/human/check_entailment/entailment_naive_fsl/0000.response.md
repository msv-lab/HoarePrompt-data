Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires a function to count the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform this task. Instead, they seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
