Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and `n` tuples of coordinates and radii of disks from the user. It then processes these disks to determine if there is at least one set of disks that can be colored in a bipartite manner (i.e., no two overlapping disks have the same color) and that set is not empty. If such a set exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the coordinates and radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not. **
