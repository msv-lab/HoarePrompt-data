Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`.**

The code initializes a new list `visited` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
