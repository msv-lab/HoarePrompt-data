### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c` with an initial value of 0.
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sum of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix count of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the array `l` and updates the prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`.
   - `p` is updated to store the cumulative sum of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is updated to store the cumulative count of the number of 1s in `l`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` of the subarray.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix count array `c`.
   - The program checks if the subarray is good based on the conditions:
     - The subarray length `b - a + 1` must be greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray `s` minus the length of the subarray `b - a + 1` must be greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray `i`.

5. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has at least two elements.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray. This is necessary because for the subarray to be good, there must be enough "slack" in the sum to allow for a different positive integer for each element while maintaining the same total sum.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The prefix sum and prefix count arrays are used efficiently to handle the queries, and the conditions are checked correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
