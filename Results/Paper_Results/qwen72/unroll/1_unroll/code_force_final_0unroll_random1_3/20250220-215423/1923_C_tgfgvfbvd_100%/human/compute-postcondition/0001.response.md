Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n + 1 integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; queries is a list of q tuples, each containing two integers l_i and r_i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `t` test cases, so `t` remains unchanged.
- For each test case, `n` and `q` (renamed to `m` in the loop) are read from input and remain within their specified bounds.
- The list `c` is initially set to `[0]` and then populated with `n` integers, resulting in a list of `n + 1` integers.
- The list `p` is also initially set to `[0]` and then populated with `n` integers, resulting in a list of `n + 1` integers.
- The loop processes `q` queries, and the values of `a` and `b` for each query are read from input and remain within their specified bounds.
- The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions, but does not modify the input variables `n`, `q`, `l`, or `queries`.
- The variables `i` and `j` are used for intermediate calculations and are reset for each test case, so they do not affect the final state of the input variables.
