### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on the given conditions:
     - The sum of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` should equal the sum of some array `b` of the same length.
     - Each element in `b` should be different from the corresponding element in the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]`.
     - Each element in `b` should be greater than 0.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good," it must be possible to construct an array `b` such that the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray, and no element in `b` is the same as the corresponding element in the subarray.
   - If the subarray contains at least one element that is not 1, we can always construct `b` by incrementing each element in the subarray by 1 and then subtracting the number of 1s in the subarray. This ensures that the sum remains the same and all elements in `b` are different from those in the subarray.
   - If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, it is impossible to construct `b` because all elements in `b` must be different and greater than 0.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It reads the array `c` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` stores the prefix sums of the array `c`.
     - `c` stores the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `c`.
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` and the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - It then checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying if:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 (i.e., the subarray has more than one element).
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray. This condition ensures that we can construct `b` by incrementing each element and then adjusting for the 1s.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and prefix counts of 1s.
   - The query processing logic is correct:
     - It checks if the subarray has more than one element.
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - The conditions ensure that a subarray can be "good" if it contains at least one element that is not 1 and has more than one element.

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.
