### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones `arr` in each pile.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game.
   - The function first checks if the smallest pile has exactly 1 stone. If so, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it immediately returns "Alice" because Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will be greater than 1.

3. **Set and Sorting**:
   - The function creates a set of unique pile sizes from `arr` and sorts it.
   - This step is crucial because it helps to identify if there are any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive pile sizes.

4. **Loop to Check Gaps**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted unique pile sizes starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than 1.
   - If such a gap is found, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If no gap is found, it toggles the value of `A` (which starts as `False`).

5. **Final Decision**:
   - If `not_c` is `False`, it means there is at least one gap greater than 1, and the game can be won by the player who starts (Alice).
   - If `not_c` is `True`, it means all pile sizes are consecutive, and the game can be won by the player who plays second (Bob) if the number of piles is even, or by the player who starts (Alice) if the number of piles is odd.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initial Check**:
  - The initial check `if (arr[0] != 1)` is incorrect because `arr[0]` is not necessarily the smallest pile. The smallest pile should be determined by the minimum value in `arr`.
  - The correct check should be `if min(arr) != 1`.

- **Toggling Logic**:
  - The toggling logic `A = not A` is used to determine the winner based on the number of unique pile sizes and their gaps.
  - However, the logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where all pile sizes are consecutive. The winner should be determined by the parity of the number of unique pile sizes, not by toggling `A` in the loop.

### Corrected Logic:
- The correct logic should be:
  - If the smallest pile size is 1, the game can be won by the player who starts (Alice) if the number of unique pile sizes is odd, or by the player who plays second (Bob) if the number of unique pile sizes is even.
  - If the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size.

### Correctness:
- The given program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly handle the initial check and the toggling logic.

### Correctness: **False**
