Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The integer `n` represents the number of houses, and the string `a` indicates the preferences of the residents, where '0' means they want to live on the left side and '1' means they want to live on the right side. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the number of residents who can be satisfied with their preferred side. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
