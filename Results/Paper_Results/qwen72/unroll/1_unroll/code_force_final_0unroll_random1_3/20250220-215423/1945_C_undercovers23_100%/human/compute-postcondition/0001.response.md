The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
