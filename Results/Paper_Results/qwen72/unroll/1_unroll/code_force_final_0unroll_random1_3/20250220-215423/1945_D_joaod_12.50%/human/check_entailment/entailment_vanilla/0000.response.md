### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in the queue) and `pos_final` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It then reads two lists: `custo_pra_trocar_a` (cost to swap with the person at position `j`) and `custo_pra_passar_b` (cost to pay each person between `j` and `i`).
   - The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `total` to 0, which will store the total cost of bribes.
   - It also initializes `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `pos_final` positions.

3. **Iterating from the End:**
   - The function iterates from the end of the queue (`na_frente` to 0) to calculate the minimum cost.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the range of `pos_final`:
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is not within the range of `pos_final`:
       - It adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, the function prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `pos_final` positions.
  - It iterates from the end of the queue, ensuring that it considers the cost of moving to each position in the correct order.
  - The use of `best` to track the minimum cost is appropriate, as it ensures that the function finds the optimal solution.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where `na_frente` is 1 and `pos_final` is 0 (i.e., Kirill must be at the front of the queue).
  - It also handles the case where `na_frente` is equal to `pos_final` (i.e., Kirill is already in an acceptable position).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The function processes each test case in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The space complexity is O(n) for storing the input lists, which is also acceptable.
