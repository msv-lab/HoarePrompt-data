Output State: **The variable `cases` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has run. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. The final value of `best` is printed for each case. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `b` are not modified by the loop.**
