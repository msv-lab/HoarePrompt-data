The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is clear that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m`: integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the size of the lists and a specific constraint on the size.
- `a`: a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the first list of integers.
- `b`: a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the second list of integers.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the given constraints. However, the specific output is not provided in the question. Assuming the function is designed to return some result based on the inputs, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a list `a` of n integers, and a list `b` of n integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints and the relationship between the lists `a` and `b`.**
