### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the maximum allowable final position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, which represent the costs for Kirill to bribe the person at position `i` and the costs for Kirill to bribe each person between positions `j` and `i` respectively.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost Kirill spends.
   - `best` is initialized to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

4. **Looping Through the Queue**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue (`na_frente` to 0) to find the minimum cost.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the range of the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`):
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to bribe the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is outside the range of the first `m` positions:
       - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people is sound.
- The program ensures that Kirill spends the minimum possible coins by considering the cost to bribe the person at position `v` and the costs to bribe each person between positions `j` and `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
