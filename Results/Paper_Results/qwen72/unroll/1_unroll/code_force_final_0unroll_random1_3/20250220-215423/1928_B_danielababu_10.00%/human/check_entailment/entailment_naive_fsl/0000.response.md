Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the provided functions do not perform this operation. They are utility functions for reading input and processing arrays, but none of them actually solve the problem as described. Specifically, there is no function that adds a permutation to the array and then finds the maximum frequency of any element in the resulting array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
