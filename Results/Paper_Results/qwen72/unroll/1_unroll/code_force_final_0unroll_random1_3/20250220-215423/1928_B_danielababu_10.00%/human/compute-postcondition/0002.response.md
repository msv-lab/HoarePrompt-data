To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `arr` is the list of integers whose length is used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Range Function Parameters:**
   - `start = len(arr) - 1`: The loop starts from the last index of the list.
   - `stop = -1`: The loop stops before reaching -1, meaning it will run until `i` is 0.
   - `step = -1`: The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(arr) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `len(arr)` must be at least 1.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - `i` must be set to `len(arr) - 1` for the first iteration.
   - `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
