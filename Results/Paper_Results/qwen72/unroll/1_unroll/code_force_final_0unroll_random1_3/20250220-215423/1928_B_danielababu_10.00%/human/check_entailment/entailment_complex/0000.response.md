### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` again.
   - It then reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which returns a list of integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program finds the maximum element `m` in the array `arr`.

3. **Generating the New Array:**
   - It generates a new array `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - This transformation is based on the idea that adding a permutation to `arr` will result in elements that are shifted by the values of the permutation. The goal is to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by this transformation.

4. **Sorting and Filtering:**
   - The new array `new` is sorted.
   - The program then creates a set `ans` to store unique elements from `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element `m` in the array `arr`.
  - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` is used to determine the potential values that can be obtained by adding a permutation. This transformation ensures that the resulting values are within the range `[1, n]`.
  - By sorting the new array and using a set to filter out elements that are within the valid range, the program correctly counts the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as the set will contain only one element.
  - The program also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same, as the transformation will result in a set of size 1.

- **Function Usage:**
  - `func_1()` is used to read integers from the input, which is appropriate for the number of test cases and the length of the array.
  - `func_3()` is used to read the array, which is correct as it returns a list of integers.
  - Other functions (`func_2`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`) are not used in the main logic of the program, but their descriptions suggest they are not relevant to the problem at hand.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, performs the necessary transformations, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

**Correctness: **True****
