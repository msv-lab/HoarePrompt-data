The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case. However, since the function definition does not include these parameters, it is unclear how the function processes them or what it returns. Without additional information about the function's output, the description of the functionality is limited to the parameters it is expected to accept.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The return value is not specified.**
