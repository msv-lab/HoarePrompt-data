The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `N` must be greater than 1**
