The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `pd` and `n` are not relevant to the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` for `1 <= i < N` is the sum of all previous elements in the list plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1**
