### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The tower starts with 0 cubes.
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive).

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `n == m`, Nikita can add `m` cubes in `m` moves, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, Nikita can add `n - 1` cubes and then remove 1 cube, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m` and `n` are both even or both odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes:
     - If both are even, Nikita can add `m` cubes in `m` moves, and the remaining `n - m` moves can be pairs of add and remove (which cancel out).
     - If both are odd, Nikita can add `m` cubes in `m` moves, and the remaining `n - m` moves can be pairs of add and remove, plus one additional add or remove to make the total number of moves odd.
   - If `m` and `n` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes because the number of cubes in the tower will always have the same parity as the number of moves.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The conditions `n == m` and `m > n` are straightforward and correct.
   - The condition `m == n - 1` is also correct because it covers the case where Nikita can add `n - 1` cubes and then remove 1 cube.
   - The conditions `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0` correctly handle the parity cases.
   - The else condition correctly handles the case where `m` and `n` have different parities, which is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
