### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **`if n == m`**: If the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m > n`**: If the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower of height `m` because he cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m == n - 1`**: If the desired number of cubes `m` is exactly one less than the number of moves `n`, Nikita can add one cube per move and then remove one cube to achieve the desired height. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`**: If both `m` and `n` are even, Nikita can achieve the desired height by alternating between adding and removing cubes in such a way that the parity of the number of cubes matches the parity of the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`**: If both `m` and `n` are odd, Nikita can achieve the desired height by alternating between adding and removing cubes in such a way that the parity of the number of cubes matches the parity of the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`else`**: If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible for Nikita to achieve the desired height. This condition is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case based on the conditions specified.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output is "Yes" if it is possible to build a tower of height `m` after `n` moves, and "No" otherwise. The logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
