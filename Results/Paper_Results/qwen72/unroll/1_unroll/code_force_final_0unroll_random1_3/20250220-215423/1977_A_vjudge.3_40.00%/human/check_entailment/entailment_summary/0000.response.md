### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove a cube in one move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - If `n` equals `m`, it is possible because Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `m` moves.
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `m` is `n - 1`, it is possible because Nikita can add `n` cubes and then remove one.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, it is possible because the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves and the number of cubes must match. This is because adding or removing a cube changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks the following conditions:
     - If `n` equals `m`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints 'No'.
     - If `m` is `n - 1`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If both `n` and `m` are even, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` and `m` are equal, `m` is greater than `n`, and `m` is `n - 1`.
   - The parity check ensures that the program correctly determines if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
