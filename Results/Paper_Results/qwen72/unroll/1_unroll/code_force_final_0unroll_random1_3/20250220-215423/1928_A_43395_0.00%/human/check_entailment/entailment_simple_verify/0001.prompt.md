You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers a and b as input, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: The function will print 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the conditions provided, but the values of `a` and `b` will remain unchanged after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He wants to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, which can be rotated and moved.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The output should be "Yes" if Bob can form a different rectangle, otherwise "No".

3. **Conditions for Forming a Different Rectangle**:
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are even, Bob can always form a different rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) or \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and then rearranging them.
   - If one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even and the other is odd, Bob can also form a different rectangle by cutting the even side in half.
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd side will result in non-integer sides, and cutting an even side is not possible.

4. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) for each test case.
   - The first condition checks if both \( a \) and \( b \) are even. If so, it prints "yes".
   - The second condition checks if \( (a - b == -a, a) \) or \( (b - a == -b, b) \). This condition is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It should be removed.
   - The third condition checks if \( (a - b) \% 2 \) is greater than 0 or less than 0. This is always true for any non-zero \( a \) and \( b \), making this condition redundant.
   - The fourth condition prints "no" if none of the above conditions are met.

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can form a different rectangle.
     - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it contains redundant and incorrect conditions. The corrected program is provided above.

Correctness: **False**
