### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the rectangles for each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - **Both dimensions are even**: If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This condition is correctly checked with `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`.
   - **Difference between dimensions is odd**: If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it implies that one dimension is even and the other is odd. In this case, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. However, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant because `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1, which is equivalent to 1 in modulo 2). Therefore, this condition can be simplified to `if (a - b) % 2 != 0`.
   - **Other conditions**: The conditions `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and unnecessary. They do not correctly check the conditions for forming another rectangle. The correct condition should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even, which is already covered by the previous conditions.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:

The function has a logical error in the conditions used to determine if another rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the conditions `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and should be removed. The correct condition should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even, which is already covered by the first two conditions.

Therefore, the function is **incorrect** due to the presence of these unnecessary and incorrect conditions.

### Correctness: **False**
