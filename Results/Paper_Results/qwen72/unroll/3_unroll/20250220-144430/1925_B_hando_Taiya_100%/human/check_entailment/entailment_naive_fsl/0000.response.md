Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the maximum balance should be `x` itself, because the GCD of a single number is the number itself. However, the current implementation does not consider this case. For example, if the input is `10 1`, the program will output `0` instead of `10`.

Here is a test case that fails:
```
Input:
1
10 1
Output:
0
Expected Output:
10
```
