The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. The function then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `min(x // n, n)`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that meets the specified condition.
