The only variables in the loop head are `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` should start from 0 (as it is the initial value for the range function).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5
- `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
- For each trace a, there exists a suitable string s

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `t` starts from 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
