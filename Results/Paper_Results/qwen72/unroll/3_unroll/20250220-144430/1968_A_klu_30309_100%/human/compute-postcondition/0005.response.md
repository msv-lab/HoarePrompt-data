Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` where each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized. The function returns a list of these integers `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the returned list `results` contains the computed values for each `x` in `test_cases`. **
