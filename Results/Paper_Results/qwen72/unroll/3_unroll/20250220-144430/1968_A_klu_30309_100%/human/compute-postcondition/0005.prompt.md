You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x in test_cases satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x in test_cases satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, results is a list of integers where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized for each x in test_cases.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers 'results', where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized for each x in the list 'test_cases'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it returns a list of integers `results` where each integer is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of gcd(x, y) + y is maximized.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers 'results', where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized for each x in the list 'test_cases'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
