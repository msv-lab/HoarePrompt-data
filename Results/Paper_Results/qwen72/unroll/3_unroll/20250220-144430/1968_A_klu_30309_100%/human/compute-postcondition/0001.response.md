The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one integer. The variable `x` will be set to the first integer in `test_cases` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000
- `results` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty for the loop to execute. The value of `t` and the state of `results` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least 1 integer, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer in `test_cases`**
