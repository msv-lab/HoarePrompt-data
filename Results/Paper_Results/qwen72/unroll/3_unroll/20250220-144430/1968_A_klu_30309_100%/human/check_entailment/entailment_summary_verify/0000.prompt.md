You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    18
    98

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` where each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized. The function returns a list of these integers `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the returned list `results` contains the computed values for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The issue lies in the `break` statement within the loop. This causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds the first `y` that satisfies the condition, rather than continuing to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found. For example, for \(x = 10\), the program will output `5` (since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)), but the correct answer should be `6` (since \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\)). This means the program does not always find the optimal `y` for every `x`.
