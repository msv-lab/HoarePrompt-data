The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns a list of integers `results`, where each integer in `results` is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`, plus `y`, is maximized for each `x` in the list `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it returns a list of integers `results` where each integer is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of gcd(x, y) + y is maximized.**
