Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The issue lies in the `break` statement within the loop. This causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds the first `y` that satisfies the condition, rather than continuing to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found. For example, for \(x = 10\), the program will output `5` (since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)), but the correct answer should be `6` (since \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\)). This means the program does not always find the optimal `y` for every `x`.
