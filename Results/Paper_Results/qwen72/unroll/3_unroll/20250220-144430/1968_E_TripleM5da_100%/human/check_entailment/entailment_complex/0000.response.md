Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by selecting specific points in the grid for each test case. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the function prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - It then prints the coordinates `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`.

3. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`.
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` is `|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)`.
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` is `|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1`.
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` for `3 ≤ i < j ≤ n` is `|i-j| + |i-j| = 2(j-i)`.

4. **Distinct Manhattan Distances**:
   - The distances `1`, `2(i-1)`, and `2(i-1) - 1` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` are all distinct.
   - The distances `2(j-i)` for `3 ≤ i < j ≤ n` are also distinct.

5. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The program ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances `1`, `2(i-1)`, and `2(i-1) - 1` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`.
   - This set of distances is indeed maximized for the given points, as it covers a wide range of distinct values.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) with a size of 2.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`, which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) with a size of 4.
   - For larger `n`, the pattern continues to ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

Given this reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by selecting points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
