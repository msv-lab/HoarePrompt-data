The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function should select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The function returns the maximum size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.
