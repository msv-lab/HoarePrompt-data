Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by selecting a specific set of points for each test case. For each `n`, the program always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) first, and then prints points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. 

However, this approach does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) should ideally contain all possible distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of the selected points. The current approach will result in a limited set of distances, particularly because the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) will always be close to each other, and the points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n will all be on the diagonal of the grid, leading to a small number of distinct distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be selected in a way that covers a wide range of possible distances. One effective strategy is to place points at the corners and along the edges of the grid, ensuring that the maximum possible distances are included.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
