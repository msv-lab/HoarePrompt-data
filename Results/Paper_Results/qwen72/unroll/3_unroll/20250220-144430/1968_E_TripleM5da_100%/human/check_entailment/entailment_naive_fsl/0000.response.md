Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the remaining points as (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|, |1-3| + |2-1|\} = \{0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |3-3|, |3-3| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

The optimal size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4, but the program only produces a set of size 5, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
