The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. The function does not return any value; it only prints the selected coordinates for each test case. After the function concludes, the input test cases have been processed, and the coordinates for each test case have been printed to the standard output.
