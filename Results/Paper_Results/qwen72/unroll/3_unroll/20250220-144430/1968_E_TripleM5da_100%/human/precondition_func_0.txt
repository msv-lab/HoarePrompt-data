The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function should internally manage the input and output for these test cases, selecting `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
