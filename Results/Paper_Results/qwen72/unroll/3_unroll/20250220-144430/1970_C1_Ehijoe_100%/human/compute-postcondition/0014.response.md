To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the state right before the loop.

### Loop Condition:
```
while curr != e:
```
This loop will execute as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`.

### State Before the Loop:
- `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
- `edges` is still an empty list.
- `empty` is still `True`.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory and it now contains `n-1` edges where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes.
- `ends` is a list containing all keys (nodes) from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node.
- `s` is the first node in `ends`.
- `e` is the second node in `ends`.
- `tree` is a list containing the first node in `ends` (`s`).
- `prev` is the first node in `ends` (`s`).
- `curr` is the first connected node of `s` in `nodes`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `curr` and `e`.
- `curr` is the first connected node of `s` in `nodes`.
- `e` is the second node in `ends`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `curr` must not be equal to `e`. Given that `curr` is the first connected node of `s` and `e` is the second node in `ends`, we need to ensure that `s` has at least one connected node that is not `e`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory and contains `n-1` edges, it is possible for `s` to have a connected node.
- However, the state provided does not specify whether `s` has a connected node that is not `e`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `curr` is not equal to `e`.

### Adjusted State:
- `curr` must be a node that is connected to `s` but is not `e`.

Since `s` is the first node in `ends` and `e` is the second node in `ends`, and `ends` contains nodes with exactly one connected node, we need to ensure that `s` has a connected node that is not `e`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory and it now contains `n-1` edges where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys (nodes) from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first node in `ends`, `e` is the second node in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first node in `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first node in `ends` (`s`), `curr` is the first connected node of `s` in `nodes` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`**.
