Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to generate a k-level permutation of length n for each test case. The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. The program constructs the permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest available numbers in the range from 1 to n.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to n.
   - It starts with the first element of the permutation as 1.
   - It then alternates between appending the next smallest and next largest available numbers to the permutation.

3. **Alternation Logic**:
   - The variable `a` is a list containing two indices: `a[0]` for the smallest available number and `a[1]` for the largest available number.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, and for each iteration, it checks if `(-1) ** i` is -1.
   - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the largest available number and decrements the index `a[1]`.
   - If `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the smallest available number and increments the index `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Permutation: `2 1`
  - Sums: `2 + 1 = 3`
  - The only sum is 3, so it is trivially k-level.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - Permutation: `1 3 2`
  - Sums: `1 + 3 = 4`, `3 + 2 = 5`
  - The maximum sum is 5, and the minimum sum is 4, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the k-level condition.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - Permutation: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
  - Sums: `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`, `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`, `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`, `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`, `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The maximum sum is 24, and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the k-level condition.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 13`, `k = 4`
  - Permutation: `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
  - Sums: `4 + 10 + 1 + 13 = 28`, `10 + 1 + 13 + 5 = 29`, `1 + 13 + 5 + 9 = 28`, `13 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 29`, `5 + 9 + 2 + 12 = 28`, `9 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 29`, `2 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 28`, `12 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 29`, `6 + 8 + 3 + 11 = 28`, `8 + 3 + 11 + 7 = 29`
  - The maximum sum is 29, and the minimum sum is 28, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the k-level condition.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - Permutation: `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`
  - Sums: `1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17`, `6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18`, `3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17`, `7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18`
  - The maximum sum is 18, and the minimum sum is 17, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the k-level condition.

The program consistently generates permutations that meet the k-level condition for the given test cases. The logic of alternating between the smallest and largest available numbers ensures that the sums of the segments of length k are balanced, and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is at most 1.
