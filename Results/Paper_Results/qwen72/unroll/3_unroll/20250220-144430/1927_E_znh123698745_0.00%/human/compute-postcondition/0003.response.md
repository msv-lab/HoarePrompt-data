Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even) and generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This sequence alternates between the beginning and the end of the array of integers from 1 to `n`. The function prints this sequence for each test case. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. **
