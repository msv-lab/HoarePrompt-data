The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the list `a`. If the list `a` consists of a single unique number repeated throughout, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The internal loop variables are reset for each test case and do not retain meaningful values after the function concludes.
