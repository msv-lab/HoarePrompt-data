You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program: 
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import inf

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will print the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `ar`. If the array `ar` consists of a single unique number repeated, it will print `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged as they are input variables. The loop variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will be reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop will not be meaningful outside the context of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the list `a`. If the list `a` consists of a single unique number repeated throughout, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The internal loop variables are reset for each test case and do not retain meaningful values after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where an array is beautiful and can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly updates the `same` counter and the `minn` variable.

The issue lies in the update logic of the `same` counter and the `minn` variable. The program should correctly identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition, but it fails to do so in this case. The program increments `i` twice in some iterations, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect counting. Additionally, the logic for updating `minn` is not correctly capturing the minimum number of elements to remove.
