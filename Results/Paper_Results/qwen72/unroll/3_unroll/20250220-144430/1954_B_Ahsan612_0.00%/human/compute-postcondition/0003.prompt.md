You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will print the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `ar`. If the array `ar` consists of a single unique number repeated, it will print `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged as they are input variables. The loop variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will be reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop will not be meaningful outside the context of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns the result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
