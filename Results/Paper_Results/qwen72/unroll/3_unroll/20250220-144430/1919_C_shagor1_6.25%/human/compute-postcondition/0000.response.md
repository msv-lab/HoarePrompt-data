The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop can execute, the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used**
