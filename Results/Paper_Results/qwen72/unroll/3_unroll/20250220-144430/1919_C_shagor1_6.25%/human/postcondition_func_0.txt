The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of an array, followed by `n` integers. It then processes the array to find two minimum values and counts the number of elements that are greater than both of these minimum values. The function prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
