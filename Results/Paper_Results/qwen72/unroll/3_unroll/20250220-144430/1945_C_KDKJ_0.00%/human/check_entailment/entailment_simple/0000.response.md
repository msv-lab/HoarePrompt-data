### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the string `a` of length `n`.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S` is a list of sublists where each sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program iterates through each possible position `i` to place the road.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously stored position.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the position `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
  - The cumulative count is correctly calculated and stored in `S`.
  - The initial state of `S` is `[[0, 0]]`, which is correct as it represents the counts before the first house.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are correctly used to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
  - The program correctly updates `ans` to the position that is closest to the middle of the village.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the road is placed before the first house (output 0) or after the last house (output `n`).

- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
