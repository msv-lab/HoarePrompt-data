Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list` containing the adjacency lists of the nodes based on the input edges, `start` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the `nodes` dictionary, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `moves` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`.
- The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `nodes` and `start`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`, and `leaves` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided, so it is described as the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.
