### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves a game on a tree where nodes are initially inactive.
   - The game consists of one round (since `t = 1`).
   - Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from the current node to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for a given starting node.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` computes the distances from the starting node to all its leaf nodes.
   - If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no other neighbors except its parent), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively computes the distances to all its child nodes and adds 1 to each distance to account for the edge from the starting node to the child node.
   - The function returns a list of these distances.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads the input, constructs the tree, and identifies the starting node.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all its leaf nodes.
   - The function then checks if any of these distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make the last move on an even distance, which means she will be the one who cannot move.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that Ron is the one who cannot make a move last.

4. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct because it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the distances.
   - If there is at least one odd distance, Ron can always make a move that leaves Hermione with an even distance, ensuring Ron's win.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring Hermione's win.
   - The construction of the tree and the identification of leaf nodes are also correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
