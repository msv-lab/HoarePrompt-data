### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with \( n \) nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and the players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round based on optimal play.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all its child nodes (excluding the parent node).
     - If the starting node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent), it returns a list containing a single element, which is 0.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for each child node and extends the distances list by adding 1 to each distance.
     - The function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case, ensuring that the distances are calculated correctly.

   - **func_2**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree using a dictionary of adjacency lists, and identifies the starting node.
     - It then calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all its child nodes.
     - The function checks if any of the distances in the list are odd.
     - If any distance is odd, Ron wins the round because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has no valid move.
     - If all distances are even, Hermione wins the round because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that Ron is the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly constructs the tree and identifies the starting node.
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all its child nodes.
   - The `func_2` function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound: if there is at least one odd distance, Ron can always win by making the first move. If all distances are even, Hermione can always win by mirroring Ron's moves.
