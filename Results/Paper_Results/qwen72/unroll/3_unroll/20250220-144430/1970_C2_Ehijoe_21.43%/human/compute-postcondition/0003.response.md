Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` changes the `nodes` variable to be a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in the dictionary, it will automatically create a list for that key. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.
