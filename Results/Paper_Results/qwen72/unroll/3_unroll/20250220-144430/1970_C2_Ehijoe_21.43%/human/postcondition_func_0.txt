The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `nodes` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree), `start` (an integer representing the starting node, where 1 ≤ start ≤ n), and `parent` (an integer representing the parent node of the starting node or None if the starting node has no parent). It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all its child nodes (excluding the parent node). If the starting node has no child nodes (excluding the parent node), the function returns a list containing a single element, which is 0. Otherwise, it returns a list of distances, where each distance is the number of edges from the starting node to each of its child nodes, after one level of recursion. The `nodes` list, `start` integer, and `parent` integer remain unchanged after the function call.
