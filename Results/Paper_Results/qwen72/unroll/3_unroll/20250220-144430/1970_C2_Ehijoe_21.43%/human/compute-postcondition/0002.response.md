Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, and the states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`) remain unchanged.
