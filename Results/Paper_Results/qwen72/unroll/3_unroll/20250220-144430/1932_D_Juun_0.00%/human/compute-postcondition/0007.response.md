The only objects in the loop head are the variables `suit` and `rank`, and the dictionary `suits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `suits` dictionary. If the `suits` dictionary has at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `suits` dictionary must have at least one suit with a non-`None` value for the loop to execute.

State: **`trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that match the trump suit, `answers` list contains the results of the comparisons between cards of the same suit but not the trump suit, `suits` dictionary must have at least one suit with a non-`None` value, `suit` is the first suit in the dictionary with a non-`None` value, `rank` is the corresponding non-`None` value for that suit**
