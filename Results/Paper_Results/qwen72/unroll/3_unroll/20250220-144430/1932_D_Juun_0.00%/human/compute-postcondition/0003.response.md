Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) where each integer represents the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n cards (each card is a two-character string, with the first character being one of "23456789" and the second character being one of "CDHS", and all cards are different). The `trump` variable is assigned the value of user input, which is a string representing the trump suit. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list.**
