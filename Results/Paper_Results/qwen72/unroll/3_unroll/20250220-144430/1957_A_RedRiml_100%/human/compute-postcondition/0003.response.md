The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `t` (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100), `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. The function returns different values based on these inputs, but the specific return values are not provided in the output section.

Since the output section is not provided, I will assume the function returns a result based on the inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100 for each test case), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100). It returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
