Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of pairs of non-negative integers `(n, m)` provided by the user. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints `1`. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and can be subtracted from `k` to result in a power of 2. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters. **
