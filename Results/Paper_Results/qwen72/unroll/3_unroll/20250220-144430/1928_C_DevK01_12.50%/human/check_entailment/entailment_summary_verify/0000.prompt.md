You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including `q` itself if it meets the condition. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( n \) and \( x \) are such that the conditions for \( k \) are not met correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the main loop has some issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The program calculates `y` as `n + x`. However, based on the problem description, the correct calculation for the position of the number \( x \) in the sequence should be based on the modulo and division operations, not just the sum of \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd `y`**:
   - The program checks if `y % 2 != 0` and prints 0 if true. This condition is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the program incorrectly prints 0 because \( y = 12 \) is even, but the correct answer should be 4 as per the problem description.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but the logic inside it is flawed. It incorrectly checks for divisors and adds them to the list `M`. The condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is not necessary and can be misleading. Additionally, the loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` should be `for i in range(1, int(w) + 1)` to include all potential divisors.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the divisors to determine the valid \( k \) values. The logic for adding divisors to the list `M` and checking if they are valid \( k \) values is flawed.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the correct output should be 4 (as \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are valid), but the program prints 0 because it incorrectly checks the condition `y % 2 != 0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
