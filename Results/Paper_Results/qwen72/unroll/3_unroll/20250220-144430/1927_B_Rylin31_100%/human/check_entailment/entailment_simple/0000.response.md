### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This list is used to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the output string.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - It constructs the character for the output string by converting the value `s[j]` to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. This ensures that the character is a lowercase Latin letter.
   - It then increments `s[j]` to update the count of occurrences for the character at index `j`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic of the program is correct because it ensures that for each `a_i` in the trace array, the character at position `i` in the output string has appeared `a_i` times before.
   - The use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` correctly maps the integer `s[j]` to a lowercase Latin letter, and the increment operation ensures that the same character is used multiple times as required by the trace.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as a trace array of length 1 and a trace array where all elements are 0.
   - It also handles the case where the trace array has increasing values, which corresponds to a string with all distinct characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string from its trace array as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
