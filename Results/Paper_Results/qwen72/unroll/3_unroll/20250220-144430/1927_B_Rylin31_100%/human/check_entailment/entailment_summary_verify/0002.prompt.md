You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array`. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a corresponding lowercase letter based on a counter `s`. The counter `s` is incremented each time an index is accessed. The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and `t` strings have been printed, each corresponding to a test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the internal state variables `s` and `ans` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string, `l`, and the trace array, `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array will keep track of the count of each character used so far.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For each element `j` in the trace array `array`, the program constructs the string `ans` by:
     - Adding the character corresponding to the current count of `s[j]` to `ans`.
     - Incrementing `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of that character.

4. **Character Mapping**:
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`. This converts the count `s[j]` to a character in the range 'a' to 'z'. For example, `s[j] = 0` corresponds to 'a', `s[j] = 1` corresponds to 'b', and so on.

5. **Output**:
   - After constructing the string `ans` for each test case, it prints the string.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.
- The logic for constructing the string `ans` is sound:
  - The trace array `array` provides the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position.
  - By using `chr(s[j] + 97)`, the program ensures that the character is chosen based on the number of times it has appeared before.
  - The array `s` is updated correctly to keep track of the counts.

### Example Verification:
- For the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the program will construct the string `abracadabra`:
  - `a[0] = 0` -> `s[0] = 0` -> `ans += 'a'`
  - `a[1] = 0` -> `s[0] = 1` -> `ans += 'b'`
  - `a[2] = 0` -> `s[0] = 2` -> `ans += 'c'`
  - `a[3] = 1` -> `s[1] = 0` -> `ans += 'a'`
  - `a[4] = 0` -> `s[0] = 3` -> `ans += 'd'`
  - `a[5] = 2` -> `s[2] = 0` -> `ans += 'a'`
  - `a[6] = 0` -> `s[0] = 4` -> `ans += 'b'`
  - `a[7] = 3` -> `s[3] = 0` -> `ans += 'a'`
  - `a[8] = 1` -> `s[1] = 1` -> `ans += 'b'`
  - `a[9] = 1` -> `s[1] = 2` -> `ans += 'b'`
  - `a[10] = 4` -> `s[4] = 0` -> `ans += 'a'`

- The program will produce the correct output for the given examples and should work for other valid inputs as well.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
