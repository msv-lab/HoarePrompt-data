Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, the function initializes a list `s` of length `l` with zeros. This list is used to keep track of how many times each character has been used.

3. **String Construction**: The function constructs the string `ans` by iterating over the trace array `array`. For each element `j` in `array`, it:
   - Converts the value `s[j]` to a character by adding 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') and then converting it to a character using `chr`.
   - Appends this character to the string `ans`.
   - Increments the value at index `j` in the list `s`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The trace array `array` is correctly interpreted as the number of previous occurrences of the character at the current position.
   - The list `s` is used to keep a count of how many times each character has been used, which is essential for reconstructing the string.
   - The function ensures that the character used at each position is the next available character in the sequence, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the length of the string `l` is 1.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in the trace array are 0, which corresponds to a string where all characters are unique.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the trace array is a sequence of increasing integers, which corresponds to a string where each character is used exactly once more than the previous character.

7. **Constraints**:
   - The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
