### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string, `l`, and the trace array, `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array is used to keep track of the count of each character used so far.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `ans` by iterating over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it adds the character corresponding to the current count of `s[j]` to `ans` using `chr(s[j] + 97)`.
   - It then increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of that character.

4. **Character Mapping**:
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which converts the count `s[j]` to a character in the range 'a' to 'z'.
   - This ensures that the character is chosen based on the number of times it has appeared before, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

5. **Output**:
   - After constructing the string `ans` for each test case, the program prints the string.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Trace Array Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `array` provides the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position.
  - For example, if `array[3] = 1`, it means that the character at position 3 in the string `s` has appeared once before in the positions `0, 1, 2`.

- **Character Selection**:
  - The program uses `chr(s[j] + 97)` to map the count `s[j]` to a character.
  - This is correct because `chr(97)` is 'a', `chr(98)` is 'b', and so on. Therefore, `s[j] = 0` corresponds to 'a', `s[j] = 1` corresponds to 'b', and so on.

- **Counter Update**:
  - The counter `s[j]` is incremented each time an index `j` is accessed.
  - This ensures that the count of each character is maintained correctly, and the next time the same count is encountered, the next character in the sequence is used.
