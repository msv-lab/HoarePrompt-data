The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which already ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. However, to explicitly state the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
