Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is greater than 0, and `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, and the execution of the program will continue from the point where this function returns.**
