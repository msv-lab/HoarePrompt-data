### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves an array `a` of length `n` and operations to replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by including the MEX of the subarray in the sum.
   - However, the logic for calculating the MEX and the maximum sum is flawed. The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray, and the recursive splits do not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The logic for checking the maximum value and constructing the operations is also flawed. The condition `max_value == length ** 2` does not correctly reflect the MEX transformation, and the recursive splits may not cover all necessary cases.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the array and the result list `res` with the operations performed.
   - The function does not correctly handle the transformation to the MEX value. It assumes a specific form of transformation (staircase) which may not always be the optimal way to maximize the sum.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program's overall logic is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and does not ensure that the operations are optimal for maximizing the sum.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements, and the recursive backtracking in `func_2` may not cover all necessary cases.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1, but the logic for transforming the subarray is incorrect.
   - It does not handle the case where the subarray is already in the desired form (MEX transformation) correctly.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is intended to avoid redundant calculations, but the incorrect logic for MEX and sum calculation makes the approach invalid.
   - The recursive backtracking may lead to incorrect sequences of operations.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
- The sequence of operations is not correctly constructed to achieve the maximum sum.
- The program does not handle all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
