Functionality: ** The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies a list `res` to store operations as tuples `(l, r)`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form (where each element matches its index from 0 to `i`). If the subarray is already in this form, the function returns without performing any operations. If not, the function recursively modifies the subarray to ensure it matches the staircase form, appending the necessary operations to `res`. After the function concludes, `arr` will have the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` set to the staircase form, and `res` will contain the operations used to achieve this. The function does not return any value. **
