Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it uses a recursive approach that does not align with the MEX concept.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The function `func_1` does not implement this logic.

2. **Incorrect Operation Sequence**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. However, it relies on the incorrect results from `func_1` and does not correctly construct the operations.
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0, but it does not correctly handle the transformation and does not align with the MEX operation.

3. **Global Variables**:
   - The program uses global variables `arr` and `res_dict` without initializing them properly. This can lead to undefined behavior and incorrect results.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed. For example, the condition `if max_value == length ** 2` is not a valid check for the MEX operation. The MEX operation should be based on the smallest missing integer, not the square of the length of the subarray.

5. **Recursive Depth**:
   - The recursive depth in `func_1` and `func_2` can be very high, leading to potential stack overflow issues, especially for larger values of `n`.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
- Implement a function to calculate the MEX of a subarray.
- Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it.
- Ensure that the operations are constructed correctly and the array is transformed as required.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def mex(subarray: List[int]) -> int:
    seen = set(subarray)
    for i in range(len(subarray) + 1):
        if i not in seen:
            return i

def max_sum_and_operations(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * (1 << n)
    operations = [[] for _ in range(1 << n)]
    
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        bits = [i for i in range(n) if mask & (1 << i)]
        subarray = [arr[i] for i in bits]
        mex_value = mex(subarray)
        
        for i in bits:
            new_mask = mask ^ (1 << i)
            if dp[new_mask] + mex_value * (mask - new_mask).bit_count() > dp[mask]:
                dp[mask] = dp[new_mask] + mex_value * (mask - new_mask).bit_count()
                operations[mask] = operations[new_mask] + [(i, i)]
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1], operations[(1 << n) - 1]

def main():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_sum, ops = max_sum_and_operations(arr)
    print(max_sum, len(ops))
    for op in ops:
        print(op[0] + 1, op[1] + 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations. It correctly calculates the MEX of subarrays and constructs the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
