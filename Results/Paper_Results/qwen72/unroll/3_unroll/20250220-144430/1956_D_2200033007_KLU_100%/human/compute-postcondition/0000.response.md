Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is True.**

The initial state is unchanged, and the variable `is_already_stairs` is set to True.
