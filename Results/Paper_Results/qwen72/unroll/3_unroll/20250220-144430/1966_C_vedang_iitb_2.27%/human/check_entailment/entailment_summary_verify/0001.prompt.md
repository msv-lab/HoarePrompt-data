You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `n` where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions: If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is 2, it returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise it returns 2. For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. If the result of the recursive call is 2, or if the result is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players can remove a positive integer \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones from the pile.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If the smallest pile size is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game by considering the subproblem with one fewer pile.
     - If the recursive call indicates that the next player (Bob) will lose (`winNext == 2`), or if the next player will win but the current smallest pile size is not 1 (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`), Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The transformation of pile sizes into differences is a valid step because it simplifies the problem by reducing the number of distinct pile sizes.
     - The transformation ensures that the smallest pile size in the new list is always 1, which is crucial for the recursive analysis in `func_2`.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The base cases are correctly identified:
       - With one pile, Alice can always win by removing all stones.
       - With two piles, the parity of the smallest pile size determines the winner.
     - The recursive case is also correctly handled:
       - If the next player (Bob) will lose, Alice wins.
       - If the next player will win but the current smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can still win by removing a sufficient number of stones to force Bob into a losing position.
       - If the next player will win and the current smallest pile size is 1, Alice cannot force a win and will lose.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 2 3 4 5` -> `1 1 1 1 1`. Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and win.
   - For the second test case: `1 7` -> `1 6`. Alice must choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob with `0 6`. Bob can then choose \( k = 6 \) and win.
   - For the third test case: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100` -> `1 2 3 4 5 6 99`. Alice can choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob with `0 2 8 6 3 1 99`. Bob must choose \( k = 1 \), and Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game for the provided test cases and follows the logic of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
