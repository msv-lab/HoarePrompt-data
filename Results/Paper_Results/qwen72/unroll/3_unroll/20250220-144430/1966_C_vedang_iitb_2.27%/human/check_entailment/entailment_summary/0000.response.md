### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones, and on each turn, a player can choose a positive integer \( k \) (up to the size of the smallest nonempty pile) and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and we need to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between consecutive unique elements in the sorted list of `a`.
   - This transformation helps in understanding the game dynamics by reducing the problem to a simpler form where each element represents the number of stones that can be removed in a single move to reach the next unique pile size.
   - For example, if `a` is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, `func_1` will return `[3]` because all piles are the same size.
   - If `a` is `[1, 7]`, `func_1` will return `[1, 6]` because the smallest unique pile size is 1, and the difference between 7 and 1 is 6.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` determines the winner based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, the player who is about to move (Alice) wins because they can remove all stones in one move.
   - If `n` is 2, the player who is about to move wins if the first element of `a_new` is even, otherwise, the other player wins. This is because if the first element is even, the player can always choose a move that leaves an even number of stones, ensuring they can always mirror the opponent's moves.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively calls itself with the list `a_new` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. This simulates the opponent's turn.
   - The function returns 1 if the opponent loses (i.e., the current player wins) or if the opponent wins but the first element of `a_new` is not 1. This is because if the first element is 1, the current player can only remove 1 stone, leaving the opponent in a winning position.
   - Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating the current player loses.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The transformation in `func_1` is correct and simplifies the problem.
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive step, ensuring that the program can determine the winner based on the optimal play.
   - The program correctly prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on the result of `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem description.
