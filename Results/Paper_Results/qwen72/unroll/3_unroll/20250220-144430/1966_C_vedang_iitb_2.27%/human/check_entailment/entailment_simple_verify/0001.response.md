### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players can remove a positive integer \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - **State After Transformation:**
     - `a_new` is a list where the first element is the smallest unique pile size, and each subsequent element is the difference between the current and the previous unique pile size.
     - This transformation is valid because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the smallest pile size is always 1, which is crucial for the recursive analysis in `func_2`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones from the pile.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If the smallest pile size is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game by considering the subproblem with one fewer pile.
     - If the recursive call indicates that the next player (Bob) will lose (`winNext == 2`), or if the next player will win but the current smallest pile size is not 1 (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`), Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **State After Recursive Call:**
     - The function correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case.
     - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` effectively reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem by removing the smallest pile size.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The transformation of pile sizes into differences is a valid step because it simplifies the problem by reducing the number of distinct pile sizes.
     - The transformation ensures that the smallest pile size in the new list is always 1, which is crucial for the recursive analysis in `func_2`.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The base cases are correctly identified:
       - With one pile, Alice can always win by removing all stones.
       - With two piles, the parity of the smallest pile size determines the winner.
     - The recursive case is also correctly handled:
       - If the next player (Bob) will lose, Alice wins.
       - If the next player will win but the current smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can still win by removing a sufficient number of stones to force Bob into a losing position.
       - If the next player will win and the current smallest pile size is 1, Alice cannot force a win and will lose.
   - **Example Verification:**
     - For the first test case: `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 2 3 4 5` -> `1 1 1 1 1`. Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and win.
     - For the second test case: `1 7` -> `1 6`. Alice must choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob with `0 6`. Bob can then choose \( k = 6 \) and win.
     - For the third test case: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100` -> `1 2 3 4 5 6 99`. Alice can choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob with `0 2 8 6 3 1 99`. Bob must choose \( k = 1 \), and Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position.

The given program correctly determines the winner of the game for the provided test cases and follows the logic of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
