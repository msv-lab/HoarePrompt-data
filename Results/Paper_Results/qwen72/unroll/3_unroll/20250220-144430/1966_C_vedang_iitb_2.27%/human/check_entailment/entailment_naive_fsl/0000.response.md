Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is intended to determine the winner of the game, but it does not handle the game logic correctly for all cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` only considers the first element of the list and the rest of the list recursively, but it does not account for the optimal strategy of both players, which involves selecting the largest possible `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and removing `k` stones from each nonempty pile.

A counterexample is the test case where `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` and `n = 5`. According to the problem description, Alice can win by choosing `k=3` on her first turn, which will empty all the piles at once. However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario and will likely return an incorrect result.

The function `func_1` is also not used in the solution, and its purpose is unclear in the context of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
