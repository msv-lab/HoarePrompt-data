Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3` to determine the number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the only variable affected is `testcases`, which holds the result of `func_3()`. No return value is specified. **
