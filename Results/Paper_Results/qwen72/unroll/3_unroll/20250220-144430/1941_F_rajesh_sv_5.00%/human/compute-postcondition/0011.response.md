To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum differences between `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for all `f` in `F`.
- `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
1. **`ans` Calculation**:
   - `ans` is defined as the minimum value of the maximum differences between two expressions for all `f` in `F`.
   - The two expressions are:
     - `D[l] + f - left`
     - `right - D[l] - f`
   - For each `f` in `F`, the maximum of these two expressions is calculated.
   - `ans` is the minimum of all these maximum values.

2. **`max` Function**:
   - The `max` function will compare `ans` and `next_max_diff`.
   - It will return the larger of the two values.

### Output:
- The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the larger of the two values: `ans` and `next_max_diff`.
- Since the exact values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of the maximum differences between D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for all f in F, and next_max_diff is the value of next_max_diff)**
