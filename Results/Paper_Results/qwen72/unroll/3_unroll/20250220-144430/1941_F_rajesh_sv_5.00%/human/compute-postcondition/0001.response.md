The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the value `testcases`. The loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
