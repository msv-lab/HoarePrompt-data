Output State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` and no other variables are affected.**

Explanation: The code snippet calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return value to the variable `testcases`. Since no variables were passed to `func_7` and no other variables are mentioned in the code snippet, the only change in the state is the assignment of the return value of `func_3()` to `testcases`. The specific value of `testcases` depends on the implementation of `func_3()`, but it is now the result of that function.
