The function `func` should accept parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions: `t` for the number of test cases, `h` and `w` for the dimensions of the board, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` for the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The constraints are `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.

The function returns the outcome of the game for each test case, indicating whether Alice or Bob wins the game based on their initial positions and the board dimensions.
