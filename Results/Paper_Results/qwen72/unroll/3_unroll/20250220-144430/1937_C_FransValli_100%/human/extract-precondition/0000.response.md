Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input sequence is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries, and each query involves four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n). The goal is to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.**
