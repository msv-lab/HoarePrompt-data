Output State: **The loop will output two indices `maxi` and `mini` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized. The variables `maxi` and `mini` will hold the indices of the elements in the permutation `p` that achieve this maximum XOR value. The list `arr` will contain all indices `i` such that `p_i âŠ• p_maxi` is equal to the maximum XOR value found during the loop execution.**
