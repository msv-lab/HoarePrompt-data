You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: The loop will output two indices `maxi` and `mini` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized. The variables `maxi` and `mini` will hold the indices of the elements in the permutation `p` that achieve this maximum XOR value. The list `arr` will contain all indices `i` such that `p_i ⊕ p_maxi` is equal to the maximum XOR value found during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function operates in an interactive environment and processes a series of permutations of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each permutation, it makes at most 3n queries involving four indices each. The function identifies and outputs two indices `maxi` and `mini` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized. The list `arr` will contain all indices `i` such that `p_i ⊕ p_maxi` is equal to the maximum XOR value found during the loop execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Maximum Element Identification:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and queries the comparison between `(p_maxi | p_maxi)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`. This ensures that `maxi` will be the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding Elements with the Same Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes an array `arr` with the index 0.
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and queries the comparison between `(p_maxi | p_arr[0])` and `(p_maxi | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`, meaning `i` is the new index with the maximum bitwise OR.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`, meaning `i` has the same maximum bitwise OR as `arr[0]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element in the Array with the Same Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element in `arr`.
   - The third loop iterates over the elements in `arr` starting from the second element and queries the comparison between `(p_mini | p_mini)` and `(p_item | p_item)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`. This ensures that `mini` will be the index of the minimum element in the array `arr`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the answer, which are the indices of the elements that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
- It then identifies all indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR with the maximum element.
- Among these indices, it finds the index of the minimum element.
- The pair `(maxi, mini)` is then outputted, which should maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is `3(n-1)`, which is within the limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and adheres to the query limit. Therefore, it should correctly find a pair of indices that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Correctness:
**True**
