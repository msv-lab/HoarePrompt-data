### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Maximum Element Identification:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and queries the comparison between `(p_maxi | p_maxi)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`. This ensures that `maxi` will be the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding Elements with the Same Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes an array `arr` with the index 0.
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and queries the comparison between `(p_maxi | p_arr[0])` and `(p_maxi | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`, meaning `i` is the new index with the maximum bitwise OR.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`, meaning `i` has the same maximum bitwise OR as `arr[0]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element in the Array with the Same Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element in `arr`.
   - The third loop iterates over the elements in `arr` starting from the second element and queries the comparison between `(p_mini | p_mini)` and `(p_item | p_item)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`. This ensures that `mini` will be the index of the minimum element in the array `arr`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the answer, which are the indices of the elements that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
- It then identifies all indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR with the maximum element.
- Among these indices, it finds the index of the minimum element.
- The pair `(maxi, mini)` is then outputted, which should maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is `3(n-1)`, which is within the limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and adheres to the query limit. Therefore, it should correctly find a pair of indices that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Correctness:
**True**
