Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given specifications. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because no two fireworks from the same installation will overlap, and the only overlap can be between the first fireworks launched by each installation.
   - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than or equal to `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // b`. This is because the first installation will only launch one firework within the visibility window, but the second installation can launch multiple fireworks within the same window.
   - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // a`. This is similar to the previous case but with the roles of `a` and `b` reversed.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because both installations can launch multiple fireworks within the visibility window, and the first fireworks from both installations will also be visible.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

The logic and the conditions in the program correctly handle the different scenarios described in the problem, ensuring that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
