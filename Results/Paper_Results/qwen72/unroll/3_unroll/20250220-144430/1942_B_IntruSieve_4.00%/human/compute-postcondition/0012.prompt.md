You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array a of length n with elements a_i (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers, `mex` is a list of integers representing the appended values based on the conditions in the loop, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after all iterations, `maxx` is the final value of `maxx` after all iterations.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The loop prints each element of the `mex` list separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the given test cases, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 and that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
