### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `mex` to store the constructed permutation and two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values used in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it implies that `p_i` is the smallest unused non-negative integer, which is `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a_i` is negative, it implies that `p_i` is a value that is not the smallest unused non-negative integer, but rather a value that makes `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` equal to `arr[i]`.
   - It also updates `maxx` to ensure that the maximum value used in the permutation is correctly tracked.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given `a` array.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling non-positive elements in `a`. Specifically, the line `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` might not always correctly identify the value of `p_i` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

6. **Detailed Issue Analysis:**
   - For non-positive `arr[i]`, the program calculates `p_i` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This assumes that `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)` is always `minn`, which is not necessarily true.
   - The correct approach should be to find the value `p_i` such that `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i = arr[i]`. This requires a more careful calculation of the MEX and the corresponding `p_i`.

7. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the program should output `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - Let's verify the program's output:
     - `a_1 = 1` implies `MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, so `p_1 = 0`.
     - `a_2 = 1` implies `MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, so `p_2 = 1`.
     - `a_3 = -2` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`, so `p_3 = 4`.
     - `a_4 = 1` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`, so `p_4 = 2`.
     - `a_5 = 2` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`, so `p_5 = 3`.
   - The program's logic for non-positive elements might not always produce the correct `p_i`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling non-positive elements in `a` is flawed. The calculation `abs(arr[i] - minn)` does not always correctly identify the value of `p_i` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce a valid permutation `p` for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
