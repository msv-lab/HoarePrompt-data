Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, it will print 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it will print 'No'. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated with each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.**
