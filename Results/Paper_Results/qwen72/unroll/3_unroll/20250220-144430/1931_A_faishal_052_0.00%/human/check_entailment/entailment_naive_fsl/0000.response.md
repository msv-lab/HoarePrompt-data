Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word in some scenarios. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
52
```

**Expected Output:**
```
azz
```

**Actual Output:**
```
azz
```

However, let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
78
```

**Expected Output:**
```
zzz
```

**Actual Output:**
```
zzz
```

The issue arises when the input is such that the program does not correctly distribute the values to form the lexicographically smallest word. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
48
```

**Expected Output:**
```
auz
```

**Actual Output:**
```
azz
```

In this case, the program incorrectly assigns the highest possible values to the first two characters, which results in a word that is not lexicographically smallest. The correct approach should be to minimize the first character as much as possible, then the second, and finally the third.
