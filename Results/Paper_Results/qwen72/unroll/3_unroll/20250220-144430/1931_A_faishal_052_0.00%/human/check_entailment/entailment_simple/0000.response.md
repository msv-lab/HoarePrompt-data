### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `cases`, which is an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - An empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the letters.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function attempts to decode the integer `lex` into three positions of letters.
   - It iterates twice (for the first two letters) and checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, less than 52, or greater than or equal to 52.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the positions are in ascending order, which helps in generating the lexicographically smallest word.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the characters corresponding to the positions in `arr` by converting each position to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the characters are printed on the same line without spaces.

### Analysis:
- The logic for decoding the integer `lex` into three positions is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and the way the positions are appended to `arr` do not correctly handle all possible values of `lex`.
- The correct approach should be to find the largest possible value for the first letter, then the second, and finally the third, ensuring that the sum of the positions equals `lex` and the word is lexicographically smallest.

### Correct Approach:
- For the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.
- The correct logic would be:
  - Assign the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
  - Assign the smallest possible value (1) to the second letter.
  - The third letter should be `lex - 2` because the first two letters are both 'a' (position 1).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Initialize the positions of the three letters
        arr = [1, 1, lex - 2]
        
        # Ensure the positions are valid (1 to 26)
        while arr[2] > 26:
            arr[2] -= 25
            arr[1] += 1
        
        while arr[1] > 26:
            arr[1] -= 25
            arr[0] += 1
        
        # Convert positions to characters
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
        # Print a newline after each word
        print()

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program does not correctly handle the decoding process to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
