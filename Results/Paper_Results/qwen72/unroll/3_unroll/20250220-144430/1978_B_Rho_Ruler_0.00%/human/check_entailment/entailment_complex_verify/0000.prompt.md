You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are positive integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are all positive integers. It calculates the value `ans` as the sum of `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`. The function returns `True` if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Given the constraints on the parameters, the function will always return `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search, but the binary search is not necessary for this problem, and the function itself does not correctly calculate the profit.

The logic in `func_1` is:
```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
```
This function calculates the profit for a given `k` but returns `True` if the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition for determining the maximum profit.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and choose the maximum profit. The provided program does not do this and instead uses a binary search, which is not appropriate for this problem.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input: `1\n4 4 5`
- Expected Output: `17`
- Actual Output: `4`

The program incorrectly outputs `4` because the binary search logic is not correctly determining the maximum profit. The correct output should be `17` as explained in the problem description.
