Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to use a binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes Bob's profit. However, the logic in the function `func_1` and the binary search loop is flawed. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given \( k \) but returns a boolean value based on whether the calculated profit is less than or equal to \( n \times \max(a, b) \). This condition does not help in finding the maximum profit, as it does not correctly determine if the current \( k \) is optimal or not.

Moreover, the binary search loop is not correctly structured to find the maximum profit. The loop should be designed to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit, but the current implementation only updates `ans` with the value of `mid` when `func_1` returns `True`, which does not ensure that `ans` is the optimal \( k \).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the profit for each possible \( k \) from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\) and keep track of the maximum profit. The binary search approach is not appropriate here because the profit function is not monotonically increasing or decreasing over the range of \( k \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = (b * k - k * (k + 1) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of \( k \) and calculates the profit for each, keeping track of the maximum profit.

Given the flaws in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
