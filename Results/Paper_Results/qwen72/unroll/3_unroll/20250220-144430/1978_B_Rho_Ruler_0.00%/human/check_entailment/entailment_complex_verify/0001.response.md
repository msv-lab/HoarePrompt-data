Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires Bob to maximize his profit by selling \( n \) buns. The first \( k \) buns can be sold at a modified price, and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (1 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine if a given \( k \) results in a profit that is valid.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed on the range \([0, n]\).
   - The midpoint \( \text{mid} \) is calculated, and `func_1` is called to check if the profit for \( k = \text{mid} \) is valid.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the profit is valid, and the search continues in the upper half to find a potentially better \( k \).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the search continues in the lower half.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total profit for selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - However, the function incorrectly calculates the profit for the first \( k \) buns as \( k \times b \), which is not the correct modified price calculation.
   - The correct profit for the first \( k \) buns should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) \).

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The correct profit for the first \( k \) buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit for the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).

6. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the profit for the first \( k \) buns.
   - The binary search logic is flawed because it does not correctly update the maximum profit found.
   - The program prints the value of \( k \) instead of the maximum profit, which is incorrect.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each \( k \) from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \) and keep track of the maximum profit.
   - The binary search approach is not necessary for this problem and complicates the solution.

Given the issues in the implementation, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
