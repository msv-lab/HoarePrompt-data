Output State: **The program returns True.**

Explanation: The expression `ans <= n * max(a, b)` evaluates the condition where `ans` is the result of `k * b + (n - k) * a`. Given that `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, the value of `ans` will always be less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This is because the maximum value of `ans` occurs when `k` is 0 or `n`, and in both cases, `ans` will be `n * a` or `n * b`, which are both less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Therefore, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is always true, and the program returns True.
