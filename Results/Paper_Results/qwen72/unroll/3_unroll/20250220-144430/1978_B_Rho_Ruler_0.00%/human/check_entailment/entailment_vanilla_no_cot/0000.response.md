Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect for the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the binary search used to determine the optimal value of `k`. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the profit for a given `k` and check if it is the maximum possible profit, but it does not correctly implement the profit calculation as described in the problem statement.

### Issues:
1. **Profit Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the profit as `k * b + (n - k) * a`, which is incorrect. According to the problem, the first `k` buns should be sold at prices `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1`, not all at `b` coins.
   - The correct profit calculation for the first `k` buns should be the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`, which can be simplified to `k * (2*b - k + 1) // 2`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is used to find the optimal `k`, but the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct way to determine the maximum profit. The condition should be based on the actual profit calculation and comparing it to the maximum profit found so far.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

### Explanation:
- **Profit Calculation**:
  - For the first `k` buns, the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2`.
  - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the profit is `a * (n - k)`.
  - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
- **Finding the Maximum Profit**:
  - We iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculate the profit for each.
  - We keep track of the maximum profit found during the iteration.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.
