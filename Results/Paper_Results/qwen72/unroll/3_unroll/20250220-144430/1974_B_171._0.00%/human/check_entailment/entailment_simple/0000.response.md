Reasoning:  
The program provided aims to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. However, the given implementation of `func_1` does not correctly perform the decoding as described in the problem statement. The decoding process should involve reversing the encoding process, which means:

1. Constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
2. Replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

The current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly tries to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from the alphabet, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string `b`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded):
    # Construct the auxiliary string r from the distinct characters of the encoded string
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Use the mapping to decode the string
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the given examples. For instance, for the input "serofedsoc", the current implementation will not correctly map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', and so on, as it does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and does not create the symmetric mapping.

Correctness: **False**
