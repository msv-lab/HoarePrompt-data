Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_cases` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to handle the decoding process.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mapping from encoded characters to their corresponding decoded characters.
   - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `encoded`.
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it iterates over all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a letter that is not yet in the `mapping` values. It then maps this letter to the current character and appends the letter to the `decoded` list.

3. **Mapping and Decoding**:
   - The logic for finding the symmetric character in the auxiliary string `r` is incorrect. The program should construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string and then map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - The current implementation does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
