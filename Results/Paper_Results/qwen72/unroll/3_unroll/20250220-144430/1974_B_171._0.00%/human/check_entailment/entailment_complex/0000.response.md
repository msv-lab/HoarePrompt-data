Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string by dynamically creating a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to the lowercase Latin letters. However, this approach does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, we need to reverse this process: create the string `r` from the encoded string, and then replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character in `r`.

The current implementation in `func_1` does not follow this logic. Instead, it creates a mapping where each character in the encoded string is mapped to a unique lowercase Latin letter, which is not the same as the symmetric replacement required by the problem. This means that the program will not produce the correct original string for the given encoded string.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
1. Construct the string `r` from the encoded string, which consists of all distinct characters in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Replace each character in the encoded string using this mapping to get the original string.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly decode the string as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
