Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_cases` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to handle the decoding process.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mapping from encoded characters to their corresponding decoded characters.
   - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `encoded`.
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it iterates over all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a letter that is not yet in the `mapping` values. It then maps this letter to the current character and appends the letter to the `decoded` list.

3. **Mapping and Decoding**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the logic for finding the symmetric character in the auxiliary string `r` is incorrect. The program should construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - The current implementation does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts.
   - Instead, it maps each character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase letter in a sequential manner, which does not follow the symmetric mapping requirement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should be:
     - Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
     - Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The mapping logic is flawed and does not produce the symmetric characters as required.

Final: **False**
