The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique lowercase Latin letter. The replacement is based on a mapping that is dynamically created during the function's execution, ensuring that each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a different lowercase Latin letter. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped letter.
