You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on specific conditions. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the program state by printing the results. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins and, if he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from any sequence of losses because he can place a bet that will ensure he wins back more than he lost.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still recover from a sequence of losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the problem becomes more complex. Sasha needs to ensure he has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and still be able to place bets to recover.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input line into `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 1` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 2` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` which is the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses. It then prints "YES" if `a >= z` and "NO" otherwise.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - Sasha can always recover from any sequence of losses because he can place a bet that will ensure he wins back more than he lost.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - Sasha can still recover from a sequence of losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover.
     - The condition `a >= x + 2` is correct.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - The program calculates `z` which is the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses.
     - The calculation `z = k - 2` and the loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and the subsequent bets needed to recover.
     - However, the loop logic is not entirely clear and may not correctly simulate the worst-case scenario. The calculation of `z` should be more straightforward and based on the geometric progression of losses and wins.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.
   - For the case where `x > k - 1`, the loop logic is not clear and may not correctly determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`. However, for the case where `x > k - 1`, the logic for calculating `z` is not clear and may not be correct. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
