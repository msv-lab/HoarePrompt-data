### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)]`, which is a valid way to read lines from the standard input in Python.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the function splits the line into three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The function then checks several conditions to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins `n` after placing bets.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **If `x < k - 1`**:
     - If `a >= x + 1`, the function prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **If `x == k - 1`**:
     - If `a >= x + 2`, the function prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **If `x > k - 1`**:
     - The function initializes `z` to `k - 2`.
     - It then iterates from `0` to `x - k + 2` and updates `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - If `a >= z`, the function prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The key idea is to determine if Sasha can always recover from a series of losses and still have enough coins to place bets and eventually win.
   - The conditions `x < k - 1`, `x == k - 1`, and `x > k - 1` are used to handle different scenarios:
     - **`x < k - 1`**: Sasha can recover from any sequence of losses because the number of consecutive losses is less than the factor by which his coins increase on a win.
     - **`x == k - 1`**: Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins initially to guarantee he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses.
     - **`x > k - 1`**: The function calculates a threshold `z` that Sasha needs to have initially to guarantee he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses. This threshold is calculated using a loop that simulates the recovery process.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `a` is just enough to meet the threshold or not.
   - The function also correctly handles the constraints given in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins `n` based on the given rules and constraints. The conditions and the threshold calculation are sound and cover all the necessary scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
