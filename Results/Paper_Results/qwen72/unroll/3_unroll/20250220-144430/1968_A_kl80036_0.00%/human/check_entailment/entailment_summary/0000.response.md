Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program computes \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (integer division of \( x \) by 2) and prints this value for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x // 2 \) is generally \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even, and 1 if \( x \) is odd. This is because:
   - If \( x \) is even, \( x = 2k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( y = k \) and \( \gcd(2k, k) = k \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( x = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( y = k \) and \( \gcd(2k + 1, k) = 1 \).

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For even \( x \), \( \gcd(x, y) + y = k + k = 2k \), which is \( x \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + k \), which is \( \frac{x + 1}{2} \).

3. **Comparison with Other Possible \( y \)**:
   - For any \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \), the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is as large as possible.
   - The choice \( y = x // 2 \) ensures that \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \). \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \). \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \). \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \). \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \). \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \). \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

The program consistently finds a \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
