Output State: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and the operation `swap(k)` is performed for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. The input to the function includes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). `n_cases` is the number of test cases provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`.
- The initial state describes the function `func` and the problem it is intended to solve, which remains unchanged.
- The value of `n_cases` is now the number of test cases provided by the user.
- No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
