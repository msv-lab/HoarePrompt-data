The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and the operation `swap(k)` is performed for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. The input to the function includes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function should return the position of the element 1 in the array after all the swap operations have been performed.
