The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `ii` should be 0, as it is the starting index for the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
