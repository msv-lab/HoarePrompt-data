The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is not a parameter of the function, it must be a global variable or defined within the function. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a non-negative integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) which is either a global variable or defined within the function. The specific return value or output is not provided.**
