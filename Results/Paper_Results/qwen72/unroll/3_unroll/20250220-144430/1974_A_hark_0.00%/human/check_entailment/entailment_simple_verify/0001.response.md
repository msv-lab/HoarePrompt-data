### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

2. **Function 3:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to compute the result.
   - The function correctly handles the input and iteration over test cases.

3. **Function 2:**
   - This function reads the values of `x` and `y` for the current test case.
   - It handles four cases:
     - **Case 1:** Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and adjusts `x` accordingly.
       - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on the screen are 15 - 4 = 11.
       - If `x` is still positive, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
       - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - **Case 2:** `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - This logic is correct.
     - **Case 3:** `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
       - This logic is correct.
     - **Case 4:** Both `x` and `y` are 0.
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.
       - This logic is correct.

4. **Function 1:**
   - This function is not used in the program and can be ignored.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - **Case 1 (continued):** The adjustment of `x` after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is flawed. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on the screen are 15 - 4 = 11.
   - **Case 2:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons when `x` is 0 is correct.
   - **Case 3:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons when `y` is 0 is correct.
   - **Case 4:** The logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed formula in Case 1. The correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` instead of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
