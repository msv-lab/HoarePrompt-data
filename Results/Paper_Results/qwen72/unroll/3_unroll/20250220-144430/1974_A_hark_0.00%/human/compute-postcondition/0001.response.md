The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it is a throwaway variable used for iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, and it must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, `t` must be greater than 0**
