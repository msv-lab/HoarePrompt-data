Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
2. `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
3. `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < y \leq 99\).
4. `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < x \leq 99\).
5. `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is defined as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - Since \(0 < y \leq 99\), `y / 2` will be a value between 0 and 49.5.
   - `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this value up to the nearest integer, so `bxsfory` will be an integer between 1 and 50.

2. **Update `x`:**
   - The new value of `x` is calculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - Let's break this down:
     - `bxsfory * 15` is an integer between 15 and 750.
     - `y * 4` is an integer between 4 and 396.
   - Therefore, the new value of `x` will be:
     - `x - (an integer between 15 and 750) + (an integer between 4 and 396)`.

3. **Determine the range of the new `x`:**
   - The minimum value of `x` after the update:
     - `x` is at least 1.
     - `bxsfory * 15` is at most 750.
     - `y * 4` is at least 4.
     - So, the minimum value of `x` after the update is \(1 - 750 + 4 = -745\).
   - The maximum value of `x` after the update:
     - `x` is at most 99.
     - `bxsfory * 15` is at least 15.
     - `y * 4` is at most 396.
     - So, the maximum value of `x` after the update is \(99 - 15 + 396 = 480\).

4. **Calculate `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
   - If the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` will be 0.
   - If the new `x` is greater than 0, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be an integer between 1 and 32 (since \(0 < x \leq 480\)).
   - Therefore, `bxsfory1` will be an integer between 1 and 33 if `x` is greater than 0.

5. **Sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is an integer between 1 and 50.
   - `bxsfory1` is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 33.
   - Therefore, the sum `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` will be an integer between 1 and 83.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the range of the possible output.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 83 (where `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, and `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`)**
