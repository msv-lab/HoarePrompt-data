Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are assigned values provided by user input, but the precondition specifies that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(x / 15))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of the division `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
   - Since `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, the possible values for `x` are in the range \(1 \leq x \leq 99\).
   - The division `x / 15` will yield a floating-point number.
   - The `math.ceil` function will round this number up to the nearest integer.

4. **Possible Values**:
   - If \(1 \leq x \leq 14\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 0.0667 and 0.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 1.
   - If \(15 \leq x \leq 29\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 1.0 and 1.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 2.
   - If \(30 \leq x \leq 44\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 2.0 and 2.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 3.
   - If \(45 \leq x \leq 59\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 3.0 and 3.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 4.
   - If \(60 \leq x \leq 74\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 4.0 and 4.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 5.
   - If \(75 \leq x \leq 89\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 5.0 and 5.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 6.
   - If \(90 \leq x \leq 99\), then \(x / 15\) will be between 6.0 and 6.6, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 7.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the ceiling of the division `x / 15`.
   - Since `x` is in the range \(1 \leq x \leq 99\), the possible outputs are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the output will be one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)**
