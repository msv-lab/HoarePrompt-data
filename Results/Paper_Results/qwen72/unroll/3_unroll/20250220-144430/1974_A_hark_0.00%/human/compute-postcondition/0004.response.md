Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from user input and executes the function `func_2` `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function itself does not return any value. **
