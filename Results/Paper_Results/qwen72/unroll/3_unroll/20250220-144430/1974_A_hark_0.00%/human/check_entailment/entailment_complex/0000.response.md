### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`. It is a straightforward and correct implementation of the `min` function. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not directly relevant to the overall correctness of the program.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The function then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - It then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - If the updated `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - It prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - It prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_2` for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- The logic for updating `x` to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and the remaining 11 cells can be used for 1x1 icons).
- The logic for calculating the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the `+ 1`.

### Corrected Logic:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
  - Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
  - Update `x` to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 11`.
  - Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
  - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
- **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
  - Print the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
  - Print the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
  - Print 0.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the errors in the logic for updating `x` and calculating the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons in `func_2`.

### Correctness:
**False**
