Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

is incorrect. The intention seems to be to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, but the formula is flawed. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
2. Determine the remaining space on those screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
    remaining_space = (screens_for_2x2 * 15) - (y * 4)
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
    x -= min(x, remaining_space)
    # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
    additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    # Total screens required
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
    print(total_screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()

func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons is properly accounted for, and then it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
