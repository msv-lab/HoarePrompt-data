You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from user input and executes the function `func_2` `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function itself does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, in `func_2`, the line:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

This line is intended to adjust the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) after placing the 2x2 icons, but it incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` and then adds `y * 4`. This does not correctly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.

### Case When the Program Does Not Work Correctly:
Consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of screens required should be 1, because one 2x2 icon can be placed, and the remaining 11 cells can accommodate all 15 1x1 icons.

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 15 - 15 + 4 = 4`

Then, it calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`

So, the program outputs `3` instead of the correct answer `1`.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
