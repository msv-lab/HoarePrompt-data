Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(y / 2))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `y` is a non-negative integer and is greater than 0, the value of `y` can be any integer from 1 to 99.
   - The expression `y / 2` will divide `y` by 2, resulting in a floating-point number.
   - The `math.ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `y` is 1, then `y / 2` is 0.5, and `math.ceil(0.5)` is 1.
   - If `y` is 2, then `y / 2` is 1.0, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
   - If `y` is 3, then `y / 2` is 1.5, and `math.ceil(1.5)` is 2.
   - If `y` is 4, then `y / 2` is 2.0, and `math.ceil(2.0)` is 2.
   - This pattern continues for all values of `y` from 1 to 99.

5. **General Formula:**
   - The value printed will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - For any odd `y`, `math.ceil(y / 2)` will be \((y + 1) / 2\).
   - For any even `y`, `math.ceil(y / 2)` will be \(y / 2\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact value printed will depend on the specific value of `y` provided by the user.
   - However, the value will always be the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
