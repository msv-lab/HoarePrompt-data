You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `x` from the user, and then for each value from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the ones provided in the last input, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then compares `x` and `y` and prints the minimum followed by the maximum. This logic works for all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The program handles all edge cases, such as when `x` and `y` are equal, and it correctly outputs the minimum and maximum values in every scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
