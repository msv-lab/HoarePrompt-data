Output State: **The loop will execute x times, and for each iteration, it will take two integers x and y as input. If x is less than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. The values of x and y will be updated with each iteration, and the final values of x and y will be the ones provided in the last input. The loop variable i will be equal to x-1 after the loop completes.**
