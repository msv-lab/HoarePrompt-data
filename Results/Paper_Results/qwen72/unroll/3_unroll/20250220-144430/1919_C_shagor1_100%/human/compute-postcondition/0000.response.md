Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged as the `pass` statement does not perform any operations or modify any variables. The function still takes two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function also still handles multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
