#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list. However, the provided code does not implement any functionality, as it only contains a placeholder `pass` statement. Therefore, from the user's perspective, the function does not perform any actions and does not return any results. The state of the program remains unchanged after the function call.
