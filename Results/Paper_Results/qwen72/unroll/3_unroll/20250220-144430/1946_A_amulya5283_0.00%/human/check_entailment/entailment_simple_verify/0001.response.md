### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient approach for reading large inputs.
   - It iterates over the test cases, parsing the length `n` and the array `arr` for each test case and storing them in a list `test_cases`. This is done correctly.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - The array is sorted using `arr.sort()`, which is a necessary step to find the median.
   - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`. This is correct for both odd and even-length arrays. For odd-length arrays, it correctly points to the middle element. For even-length arrays, it points to the left middle element, which is the correct median according to the problem description.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array using `heap = arr[median_index:]` and `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
   - This initialization is correct because it focuses on the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median, which are the ones that need to be incremented to increase the median.

4. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted and added to `operations`.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that the smallest possible elements are incremented first, which minimizes the total number of operations required to increase the median.

5. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required to increase the median is appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed one by one.
   - This output is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The state is correctly described: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, a)` with `n` being an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 10^5\) and `a` being a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

- **State After Function Call:**
  - The state is correctly described: `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list of the corresponding test case greater than the median of that list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently, and the program handles all edge cases correctly.
