The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of t test cases, `results` is an empty list**
