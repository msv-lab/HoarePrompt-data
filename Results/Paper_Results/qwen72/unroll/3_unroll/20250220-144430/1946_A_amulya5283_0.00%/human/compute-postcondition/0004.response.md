The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`. In each tuple, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` integers. Each integer in the `results` list represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list of the corresponding test case greater than the median of that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list `a` greater than the median of that list.**
