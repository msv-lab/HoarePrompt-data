Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list `a` greater than the median of that list. The input `test_cases` list remains unchanged after the function execution. **
