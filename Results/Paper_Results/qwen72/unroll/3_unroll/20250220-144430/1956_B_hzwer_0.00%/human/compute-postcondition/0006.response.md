Output State: **The `dp` table is updated such that `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the `i`-th card to the `n-1`-th card, given that the card with value `j+1` can be used up to its count in the `cards` list. The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged.**
