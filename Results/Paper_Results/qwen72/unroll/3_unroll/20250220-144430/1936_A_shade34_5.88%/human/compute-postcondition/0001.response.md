Output State: **The loop will output the indices `mak2` and `mak` such that `p[mak2] âŠ• p[mak]` is maximized for each permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is the length of the permutation. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` will be reset for each new permutation, and the loop will repeat for the number of test cases specified by the initial input.**
