The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This means that the input provided to the function must be a positive integer. The state of the function's interactive environment and the input it receives are the critical factors here.

Given the initial state:
- The function operates in an interactive environment.
- The input is a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- The function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
- The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. This means the input must be a positive integer.

State: **The function operates in an interactive environment where it receives a positive integer input, and the loop will execute for the number of times specified by this input.**
