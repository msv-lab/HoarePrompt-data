Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where it receives input and provides output through a series of queries. The input is a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
