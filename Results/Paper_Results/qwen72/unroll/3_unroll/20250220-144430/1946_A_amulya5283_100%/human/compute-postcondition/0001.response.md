The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that `t` is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`. The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
