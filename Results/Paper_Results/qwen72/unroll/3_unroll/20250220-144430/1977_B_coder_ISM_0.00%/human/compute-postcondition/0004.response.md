Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string of length 30. It then applies a series of transformations to this binary string, which may result in the string being modified and potentially extended to a length of 31. The function prints the original binary string, the length of the modified string, and the modified binary string for each test case. The value of `x` is not preserved across iterations, and the final state includes the modified binary string and its length. **
