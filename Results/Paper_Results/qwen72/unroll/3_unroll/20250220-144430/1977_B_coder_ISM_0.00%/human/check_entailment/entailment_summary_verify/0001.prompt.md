You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        print(*s)
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):

                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string of length 30. It then applies a series of transformations to this binary string, which may result in the string being modified and potentially extended to a length of 31. The function prints the original binary string, the length of the modified string, and the modified binary string for each test case. The value of `x` is not preserved across iterations, and the final state includes the modified binary string and its length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` using 30 bits.
   - It checks each bit of `x` using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`) and appends '1' or '0' to `s` accordingly.

3. **Adjusting the Representation**:
   - The program then iterates through the array `s` to adjust the values to meet the constraints.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a carry needs to be propagated.
   - If a carry is needed and the current bit is '0', it changes the bit to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the current bit and the next bit are both '1' and the flag is not set, it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is '1', it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program makes a final pass through the array to ensure that no two consecutive bits are non-zero.
   - If a bit is '-1' and the previous bit is '1', it changes the current bit to '0' and the previous bit to '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself.

### Analysis of Constraints and Correctness:

- **Binary Representation**: The initial binary representation is correct, but it needs to be adjusted to meet the constraints.
- **Carry Propagation**: The carry propagation logic is designed to ensure that no two consecutive bits are non-zero. However, the logic seems to be handling the carry in a way that might not always produce the correct result.
- **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments are necessary to ensure that the array meets the constraints, but the logic might not be robust enough to handle all edge cases.

### Potential Issues:

- **Carry Propagation**: The carry propagation logic might not correctly handle cases where multiple consecutive bits need to be adjusted.
- **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments might not always result in a valid array, especially if the carry logic has not been fully resolved.

### Example Test Cases:

- For `x = 14`, the binary representation is `1110`. The program should adjust this to `0 -1 0 0 1` to meet the constraints.
- For `x = 24`, the binary representation is `11000`. The program should adjust this to `0 0 0 -1 0 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for carry propagation and final adjustments is not entirely clear and might not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
