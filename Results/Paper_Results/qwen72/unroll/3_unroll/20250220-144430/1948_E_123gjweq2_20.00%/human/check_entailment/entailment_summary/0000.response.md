### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, ensuring each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` and filled with zeros.
     - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.
     - Finally, it prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - This function is responsible for populating the `arr` and `cliquess` lists within the specified range `[left, right]`.
     - It assigns the first half of the range with values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
     - It assigns the second half of the range with values from `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)` to `right + 1`.
     - It also assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Distinct Integers Assignment:**
     - The function `make_array` ensures that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n].
     - The first half of the range is assigned values starting from `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
     - The second half is assigned values starting from `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)` to `right + 1`.
     - This guarantees that all values in `arr` are distinct and cover the range [1, n].

   - **Clique Formation:**
     - The function `func_1` divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques.
     - Each clique is formed by the function `make_array`, which assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` such that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied within each clique.
     - The pattern of assignment in `make_array` ensures that the vertices within each segment (clique) are connected according to the given condition.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - The function `func_1` prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.
     - The values in `cliquess` indicate the partition of the graph into cliques, where `cliquess[i]` is the clique index for vertex `i`.

4. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - The function handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values.
   - For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function correctly prints:
     ```
     2 1
     1
     1 1
     ```
   - When `n = 8` and `k = 16`, the function correctly prints:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
     1
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly assigns distinct integers to vertices, forms the minimum number of cliques, and prints the partition as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
