You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the `res` list contains the results of the computations for each test case, and the variables `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are in their final states for the last test case processed. Specifically, `ans` will be 1 (or 0 if any division by zero occurred), `c` will be equal to `n`, `l` will be equal to `n` if all characters in `s` were 'R', or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise, and `r` will be -1 if all characters in `s` were 'L', or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise. The `res` list will have been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of length `n` where the first element is the product of all integers in `a` modulo `m` and then further modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are computed by iteratively dividing the current product by elements in `a` based on the direction specified by the characters in `s` ('L' for left, 'R' for right), and then applying the same modulo operations. The function prints the `res` list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the `res` list for the last test case is printed, and the variables `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are in their final states, with `ans` being 1 (or 0 if any division by zero occurred), `c` equal to `n`, `l` equal to `n` if all characters in `s` were 'R' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise, and `r` equal to -1 if all characters in `s` were 'L' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.
   - It initializes a result list `res` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which will be used to store the product of the elements of the array.

2. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - This step is correct and necessary to compute the initial remainder.

3. **Initial Remainder Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.
   - It also takes an additional modulo `MOD` (which is `10^9 + 6`), but this is unnecessary and can be removed since the problem does not require such a large modulo.

4. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates through the command string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of the array `arr[l]`, updates the result list `res`, and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of the array `arr[r]`, updates the result list `res`, and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - The program correctly updates the result list `res` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result list `res` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Modulo `MOD`:** The program uses an additional modulo `10^9 + 6` which is not required by the problem statement. This can be removed to simplify the code.
- **Division and Modulo Operation:** The division operation `ans // arr[l]` or `ans // arr[r]` might not always yield the correct result because integer division in Python can introduce rounding errors. Instead, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to correctly handle the division under modulo.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but the use of integer division and the unnecessary modulo `MOD` can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
To ensure correctness, we should use modular multiplicative inverses for division under modulo. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def modinv(a, m):
    a, m = a % m, m
    if gcd(a, m) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Inverse does not exist")
    x, y = 1, 0
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        a, m = m, a % m
        x, y = y, x - q * y
    if x < 0:
        x += m
    return x

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modinv(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modinv(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **modinv Function:** This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` under modulo `m` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- **Initial Product Calculation:** The product is calculated modulo `m` to prevent overflow.
- **Processing Commands:** Instead of using integer division, the program multiplies `ans` by the modular inverse of the element being removed, ensuring the result remains correct under modulo `m`.
