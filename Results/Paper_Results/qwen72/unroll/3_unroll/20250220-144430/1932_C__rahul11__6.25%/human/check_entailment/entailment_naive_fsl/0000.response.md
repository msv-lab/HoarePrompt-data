Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Incorrect MOD Value**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, but the problem description does not specify any need for this MOD value. The correct MOD value should be `m` as specified in the input.

2. **Division in Modulo Arithmetic**: The program uses integer division (`ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]`) to update the product. However, division in modulo arithmetic is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the program should use the modular multiplicative inverse to correctly handle the division.

3. **Potential Zero Division Error**: If the array contains a zero, the program will attempt to divide by zero, which will raise an error.

4. **Incorrect Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation should be done modulo `m` to avoid overflow issues, but the program does not do this.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```

Actual Output:
```
0 2 4 4
```

The actual output is incorrect because the division in modulo arithmetic is not handled correctly, leading to the wrong result for the last command.
