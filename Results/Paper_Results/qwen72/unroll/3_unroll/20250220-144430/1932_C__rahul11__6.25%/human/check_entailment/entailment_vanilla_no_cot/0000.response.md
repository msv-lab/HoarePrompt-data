Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect MOD Usage**: The `MOD` variable is set to `10 ** 9 + 6`, but this is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem. The problem only requires taking the remainder with respect to `m`, not an additional `MOD`.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product of the array elements is calculated correctly, but the `MOD` operation is applied unnecessarily. The product should only be taken modulo `m`.

3. **Division in Modular Arithmetic**: When removing an element from the array, the program uses integer division (`//`) to update the product. However, in modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward and should be handled using the modular multiplicative inverse if the divisor and `m` are coprime. If they are not coprime, the division can result in incorrect values.

4. **Indexing and Range Issues**: The loop that processes the commands should run `n` times, not `n - 1` times. The program should also handle the case where the array becomes empty correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(1, n):
            if s[k-1] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse
                r -= 1
            res[k] = ans
        print(*res)
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
1. **Removed Unnecessary MOD**: The `MOD` variable is removed, and all operations are performed modulo `m`.

2. **Corrected Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product is taken modulo `m` directly.

3. **Used Modular Inverse for Division**: Instead of using integer division, the program uses the modular multiplicative inverse to "divide" by the element being removed. This is done using `pow(arr[i], m-2, m)`, which computes the inverse under modulo `m` (assuming `m` is a prime number).

4. **Corrected Loop Range**: The loop now runs from `1` to `n` to ensure all commands are processed.

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.
