Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the `res` list contains the results of the computations for each test case, and the variables `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are in their final states for the last test case processed. Specifically, `ans` will be 1 (or 0 if any division by zero occurred), `c` will be equal to `n`, `l` will be equal to `n` if all characters in `s` were 'R', or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise, and `r` will be -1 if all characters in `s` were 'L', or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise. The `res` list will have been printed for each test case.**
