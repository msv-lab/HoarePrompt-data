The only variables in the loop head are `y` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state of `t` and the constraints on `n`, `m`, and the list `a` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `y` should start at 0, and the input value must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, the input value must be greater than 0**
