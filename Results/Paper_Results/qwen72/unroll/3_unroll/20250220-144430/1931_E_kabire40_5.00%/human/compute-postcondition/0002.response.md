The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple inputs, likely in the form of a list or tuple, to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers, `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, ensuring that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6`, and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.**
