Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the game logic correctly. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha as described in the problem statement. Instead, it reverses the digits of some numbers and concatenates them in a specific order, which does not follow the rules of the game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Sasha
```

Actual Output:
```
Anna
```

The program incorrectly determines that Anna wins, whereas according to the game rules, Sasha should win. This is because the program does not correctly simulate the game where Anna reverses the digits of one of the numbers and Sasha concatenates the two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^2\).
