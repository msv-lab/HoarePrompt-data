Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form a tent of 3 people. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 4 1
```

Here, there is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal. The program will output:
```
-1
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```

The correct arrangement would be:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 3 extroverts (2 extroverts and 1 universal).
- 1 tent for the remaining extrovert.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, leading to the incorrect output.
