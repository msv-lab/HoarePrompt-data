Postcondition: **`flag` is `False`, the values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered, `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop.**
