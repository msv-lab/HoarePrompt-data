Output State: `results` is a list containing the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and (a_i + a_j) is divisible by x and (a_i + a_j) is divisible by y. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to the count of such pairs for the respective test case. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
