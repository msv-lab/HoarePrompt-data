The only objects in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be set based on the first tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the list of integers following the first tuple, `results` is an empty list**
