The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a tuple with three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of pairs (i, j) in the corresponding test case such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and the sum (a_i + a_j) is divisible by both x and y. The input list `test_cases` remains unchanged.
