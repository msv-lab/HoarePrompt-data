To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the code step by step and understand the values of the variables and objects involved.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The code first reads an integer `t` from the input using `int(input())`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The code then enters a loop that runs `t` times using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, resulting in a list of four integers.

3. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The code uses a list comprehension to calculate a sum for each test case.
   - For each integer `x` in the list of four integers, it performs the following calculation:
     - `3 * (x // 2)`: This calculates the number of complete pairs of `x` and multiplies by 3.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)`: This checks if `x` has a remainder when divided by 2 (i.e., if `x` is odd). If `x` is odd and `i` is less than 3, it adds 1 to the sum. If `x` is odd and `i` is 3, it adds 0 to the sum.
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 using integer division `// 3`.

4. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The result of the sum calculation for each test case is converted to a string.
   - These strings are joined together with a newline character `\n` to form the final output string.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example with `t = 2` and the following test cases:
- Test Case 1: `p_i = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Test Case 2: `p_i = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

#### Test Case 1:
- `p_i = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Calculation for each `x` in `p_i`:
  - `x = 1`: `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `x = 2`: `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3`
  - `x = 3`: `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 4`
  - `x = 4`: `3 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 2 + 0 * 0 = 6`
- Sum: `1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14`
- Result: `14 // 3 = 4`

#### Test Case 2:
- `p_i = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- Calculation for each `x` in `p_i`:
  - `x = 0`: `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 0 * 1 = 0`
  - `x = 1`: `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `x = 2`: `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3`
  - `x = 3`: `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 0 = 3`
- Sum: `0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7`
- Result: `7 // 3 = 2`

### Final Output:
The code will print the results of the sum calculation for each test case, each on a new line.

Output: **4
2**

### General Description:
The `print` statement will output the integer result of the sum calculation for each test case, divided by 3 using integer division. Each result will be printed on a new line.

Output: **[result1]
[result2]
...
[resultT] (where result1, result2, ..., resultT are the integer results of the sum calculation for each test case, divided by 3 using integer division)**
