Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. Since `k` is 0, all elements in the list are 0, and the last element is also 0. Therefore, the list `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**
