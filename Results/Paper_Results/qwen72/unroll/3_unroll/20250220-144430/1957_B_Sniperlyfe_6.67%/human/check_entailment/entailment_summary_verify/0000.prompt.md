You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. Each element in the list is initially set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element, which is adjusted to be `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k` after the loop. The final state of the program is a list `nums` where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is smaller than the number of bits required to represent `n` non-negative integers in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Specifically, if `k` is small, the program may incorrectly distribute the values, leading to a sum that does not equal `k`.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `0`

The program sets all elements to the maximum value that can be represented with the bit length of `k` minus 1, and then adds the remaining `k` to the last element. For `k = 1`, this results in all elements being set to 0 initially, and then the last element being set to 1, which is incorrect because it should be the only element and should be 1.
