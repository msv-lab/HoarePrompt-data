Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times.
- In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits.
- `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[i]`.
- After `n` iterations, `nums` will be a list where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `k` will be `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
