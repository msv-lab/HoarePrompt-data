The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`. All elements in the list are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. If `k` is 0, all elements in the list are 0, and the last element is also 0. Therefore, the list `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` zeros.**
