You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `nums`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. Since `k` is 0, all elements in the list are 0, and the last element is also 0. Therefore, the list `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - For each integer in the sequence, the function sets it to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This number is then subtracted from `k`.
   - Finally, the remaining value of `k` is added to the last element of the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` generates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit set in `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary 1010), `k.bit_length()` is 4, so `(1 << 3) - 1` is 7 (binary 111).
   - This ensures that each number in the sequence has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.
   - By setting each number in the sequence to this value and then adjusting the last number to account for the remaining sum, the function ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is very small (e.g., 1), the function will set each number in the sequence to 0 and then add `k` to the last number. This is correct because the sum of the sequence will still be `k`, and the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - If `n` is 1, the function will set the single number to `k`, which is correct because the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

5. **Ensuring the Sum**:
   - The function ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` by adding the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence. This is a valid approach because it maintains the sum while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

6. **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
   - By setting each number in the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the function ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible. This is because each number in the sequence will have the same set of bits, and the bitwise OR will combine all these bits.

7. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the sequence into a string and appending it to the results list.
   - The results are then printed with each sequence on a new line.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
