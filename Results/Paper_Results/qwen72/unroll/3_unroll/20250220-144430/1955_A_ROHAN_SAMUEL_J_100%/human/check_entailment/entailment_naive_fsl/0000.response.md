Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases based on the given problem description. It checks if the number of yogurts `n` is odd or even and then calculates the minimum cost accordingly. 

- If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`). If so, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`). Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
- If `n` is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`). If so, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`). Otherwise, it buys all pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
