### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - **Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and buys one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`), resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **Even `n`**: If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions `if 2 * a < b` and `if n % 2` are correctly used to determine the minimum cost.
   - For odd `n`, the program correctly adds the cost of one additional yogurt when using the promotion price.
   - For even `n`, the program correctly calculates the total cost using the promotion price if it is cheaper.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct minimum cost for each test case, which matches the expected output based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given conditions and constraints, and it produces the correct output for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
