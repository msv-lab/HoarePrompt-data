#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input through a method not defined in the function signature, such as reading from standard input or another source. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the list `a` contains `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The keys in `cnt` will be the unique integers from `a`, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`. The variables `N` and `a` will remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the first integer `i` where either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. The variables `N` and `a` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers from standard input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function returns the first integer `i` (starting from 0) where either the count of `i` in `a` is 0, or there are at least two unique integers in `a` that have a count of 1. The variables `N` and `a` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
