The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept parameters through its function signature. However, it is expected to read input from a source such as standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < n). The number of test cases `t` is an integer (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function processes this input and returns a result based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from an input source. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes this input and returns a result for each test case.**
