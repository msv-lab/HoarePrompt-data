### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends elements to an array `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by deleting it if possible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of `c`.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of times an integer appears exactly once in `a`.

4. **Key Logic:**
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it means the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`. Alice can include this integer in `c`, and Bob can delete it, so `t` is incremented.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it means either:
     - There are two or more integers that appear exactly once, which means Alice can include one and Bob can delete the other, and the MEX will be `i`.
     - The integer `i` does not appear in `a` at all, so the MEX will be `i`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a specific order.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program correctly returns the MEX of `c` for each test case.
   - The provided example test cases are handled correctly by the program.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers from standard input.
  - It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.
  - It returns the first integer `i` (starting from 0) where either the count of `i` in `a` is 0, or there are at least two unique integers in `a` that have a count of 1.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic of counting the occurrences of each integer using `defaultdict` is correct.
  - The iteration through integers from 0 to `N` to find the MEX is also correct.
  - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` ensures that the MEX is found correctly:
    - If `t >= 2`, it means there are at least two integers that appear exactly once, and Alice can include one of them while Bob deletes the other, making `i` the MEX.
    - If `cnt[i] == 0`, it means `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`, making `i` the MEX.

- **Handling of Test Cases:**
  - For the test case `4 0 0 1 1`:
    - `cnt` will be `{0: 2, 1: 2}`.
    - The loop will return `2` because `cnt[2] == 0`.
  - For the test case `4 0 1 2 3`:
    - `cnt` will be `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`.
    - The loop will return `1` because `t` will be `4` after processing all integers, and the first `i` where `t >= 2` is `1`.
  - For the test case `2 1 1`:
    - `cnt` will be `{1: 2}`.
    - The loop will return `0` because `cnt[0] == 0`.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
  - It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.
