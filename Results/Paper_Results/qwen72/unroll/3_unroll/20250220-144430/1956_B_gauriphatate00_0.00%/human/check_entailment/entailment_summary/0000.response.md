### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - **Behavior**: It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then calculates the number of pairs of integers (i.e., integers that appear exactly twice) and returns the minimum of this number and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly identifies the number of pairs of integers in your hand.
     - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which is the maximum number of points you can get if Nene plays optimally. This is because Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours, so you can only score points for the pairs you have up to half of the total number of cards you have.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads the input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It processes each test case by extracting the integer `n` and the list of integers `a`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - Finally, it prints each result in `results`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and collects the results.
     - It prints the results for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly solve the problem as described. `func_1` calculates the maximum points you can get for a single test case, and `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results. The logic and behavior of both functions align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
