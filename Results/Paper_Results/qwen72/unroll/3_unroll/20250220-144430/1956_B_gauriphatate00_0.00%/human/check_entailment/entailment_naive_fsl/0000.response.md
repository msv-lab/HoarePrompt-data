Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of pairs you can form with the cards in your hand, but it does not consider the optimal play strategy of Nene, who always plays to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program returns `2` because it counts the number of pairs you can form (1 pair of `1`s and 1 pair of `2`s), but it does not account for Nene's optimal play. According to the problem description, Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The correct output should be `1` because Nene will play her `2` and `3` cards before you can play your second `1` card, ensuring that you only get 1 point.

The program needs to simulate the game more accurately to ensure that it considers the optimal play of both players.
