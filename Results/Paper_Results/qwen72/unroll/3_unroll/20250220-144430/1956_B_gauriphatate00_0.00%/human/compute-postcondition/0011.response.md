The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, we can infer that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, given the context, we can infer that the function might return some result based on the input parameters, but without further details, we cannot determine the exact output.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.**
