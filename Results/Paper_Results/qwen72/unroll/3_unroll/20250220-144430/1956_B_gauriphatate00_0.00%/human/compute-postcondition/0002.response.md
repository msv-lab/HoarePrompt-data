Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `idx` is 0.** 

The variable `idx` is assigned the value 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged.
