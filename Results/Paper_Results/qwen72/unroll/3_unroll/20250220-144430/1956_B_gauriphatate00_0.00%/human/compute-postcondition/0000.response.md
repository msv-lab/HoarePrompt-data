The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. The only impact is on the `input` variable, which now points to the `read` method instead of the original `input` function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.**
