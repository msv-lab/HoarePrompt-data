Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.** 

The list `arr` has been sorted in ascending order, while the value of `n` remains unchanged. Each element in `arr` is still an integer within the specified range, but now the list is ordered from the smallest to the largest element.
