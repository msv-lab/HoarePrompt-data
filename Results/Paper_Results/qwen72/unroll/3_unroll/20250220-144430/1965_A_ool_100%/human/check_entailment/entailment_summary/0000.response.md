Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`. This part of the program is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first checks if the smallest pile size is greater than 1. If so, it returns 'Alice' because Alice can always choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size and empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the function then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and iterating through them.
   - If the differences are all 1, the function toggles the boolean `A` one more time before returning the result. This is because if the differences are all 1, the game can be reduced to a sequence of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile, and the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles.

3. **Logic for Winning**:
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by removing `k` stones equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, the game reduces to a sequence of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile. The winner in this case depends on the parity of the number of piles. If the number of piles is odd, Alice wins; if it's even, Bob wins.
   - If the differences are not all 1, Alice can always win by choosing a `k` that breaks the sequence, ensuring she can always make a move while Bob cannot.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has more than 1 stone.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
