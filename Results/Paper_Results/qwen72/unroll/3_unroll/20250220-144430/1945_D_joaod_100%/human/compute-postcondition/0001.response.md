The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are defined, but they do not directly affect the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0 and `c` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of integers of length n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of integers of length n such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
