Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cost to move to a position is higher than the cost to move through intermediate positions. Specifically, the logic for updating `total` and `best` is flawed. It does not consider the optimal way to move Kirill to the desired position while minimizing the total cost.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `17`.

**Explanation:**
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- To move to position 2, he can:
  - Move to position 3, paying `9` coins.
  - Move to position 2, paying `6` coins.
  - Total cost: `9 + 6 = 15`.
- Alternatively, he can:
  - Move to position 3, paying `9` coins.
  - Move to position 2, paying `3` coins.
  - Total cost: `9 + 3 = 12`.
- The minimum cost to move to position 2 is `14` (by moving to position 3 and then to position 2, paying `9 + 5`).

The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost in this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.
