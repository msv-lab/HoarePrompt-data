You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, leaving the variables `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. `p` is a list of length `n` containing integers where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is 2, `p` is a list of length 2 containing integers where `p_0` and `p_1` are the best friends of the 0-th and 1-st friend, respectively, and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element being 0 and the remaining two elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, leaving the variables `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the minimum number of invitations required is greater than 3. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

In this case, the friends form a cycle of length 6. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends. However, the program will incorrectly print 3, even though it should print 4 to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. The logic in the program only checks for cycles of length 3 (using `v[v[v[i]]] == i`), but it does not handle cycles of other lengths.
