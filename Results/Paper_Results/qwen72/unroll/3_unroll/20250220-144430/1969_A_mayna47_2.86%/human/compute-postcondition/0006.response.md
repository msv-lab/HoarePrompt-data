The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but given the state, `n` is already an integer between 3 and 50, inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. The loop starts with `i` being 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 1**
