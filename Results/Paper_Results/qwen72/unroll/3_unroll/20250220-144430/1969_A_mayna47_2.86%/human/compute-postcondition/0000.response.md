Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, and the function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend.**
