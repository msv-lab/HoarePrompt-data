Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `p` is a list of length `n` containing integers where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `v`. The first element of `v` remains 0, and the remaining elements are replaced with the integers provided by the user input. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.
