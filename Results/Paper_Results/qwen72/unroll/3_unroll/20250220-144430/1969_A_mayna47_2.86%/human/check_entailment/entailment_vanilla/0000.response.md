### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 (to make the indices 1-based).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Triplet Cycles:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., friend `i`'s best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`).
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any 2 friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Default Case:**
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`.
- The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 and prints 2 for such cases.
- However, the program does not handle other cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3. For example, if there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program will still print 3, which is incorrect.

### Example:
- Consider the input `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. Here, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends. The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because Monocarp can invite any one pair (e.g., friends 1 and 2) to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3.

### Correctness:
**False**
