### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros and then updates it to include the best friend relationships starting from index 1.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 2` by printing 2 and returning. This is correct because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Triplet Cycles:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any 2 friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Default Case:**
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect. There are cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3, such as when there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

### Example:
- Consider the input `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. Here, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends. The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because Monocarp can invite any one pair (e.g., friends 1 and 2) to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3. Specifically, it fails to identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and can be invited with just 2 invitations.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
