Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v` (after adjusting the indexing by prepending a 0 to the list).

2. **Special Case for 2 Friends**: If `n` is 2, the function correctly prints 2. This is because, in this case, the only way to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is to invite both of them, as they are each other's best friends.

3. **Loop for Triplet Check**: The function checks for a specific condition in the loop: `if v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, the function prints 2 and returns. This is correct because, in such a cycle, inviting any two friends will ensure that both of them come to the party, as each of them has an invitation and their best friend also has an invitation.

4. **Default Case**: If no such triplet is found, the function prints 3. This is a reasonable default because, in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 2 friends might not be enough if they are not in a cycle of length 3, and inviting 3 friends will always ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

5. **Test Cases**: The function correctly handles the test cases provided in the problem description:
   - For `n = 5` and `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, the function will find a cycle of length 3 (1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1) and print 2.
   - For `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the function will not find a cycle of length 3 and print 3.
   - For `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the function will print 2 directly.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
