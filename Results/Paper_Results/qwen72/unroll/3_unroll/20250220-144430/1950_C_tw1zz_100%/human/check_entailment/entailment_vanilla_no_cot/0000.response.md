Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including handling the transition from AM to PM and the special cases for "12:00 AM" and "12:00 PM". The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each 24-hour hour to its corresponding 12-hour hour and AM/PM indicator. The output format is also correct, as it prints the time in the required "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" format. 

However, the program can be optimized to reduce the number of `if-elif` statements, but for the given problem and input constraints, it is functionally correct.
