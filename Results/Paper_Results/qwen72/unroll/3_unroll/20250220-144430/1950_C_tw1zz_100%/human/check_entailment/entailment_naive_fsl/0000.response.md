Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is '12' correctly for AM. According to the problem description, "12:00 AM" should be the output for "00:00" in 24-hour format. However, the program outputs "12:00 AM" for "00:00" and "12:00 PM" for "12:00". This is incorrect because "12:00 AM" should be the output for "00:00" and "12:00 PM" should be the output for "12:00". 

To fix this, the program should handle the '12' hour case for both AM and PM correctly. For example, "00:00" should be converted to "12:00 AM" and "12:00" should be converted to "12:00 PM".
