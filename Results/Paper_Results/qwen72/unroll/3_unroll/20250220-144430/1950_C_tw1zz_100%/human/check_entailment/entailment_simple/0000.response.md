Reasoning:  
The program is designed to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads a time in 24-hour format, converts it to 12-hour format, and prints the result.

The program correctly handles the conversion for each hour in the 24-hour format:
- For hours from 01 to 11, it correctly appends "AM" and keeps the hour as is.
- For hour 12, it correctly appends "PM" and keeps the hour as 12.
- For hours from 13 to 23, it correctly subtracts 12 from the hour and appends "PM".
- For hour 00, it correctly converts it to 12 and appends "AM".

However, the program has a logical flaw:
- It does not handle the conversion for hour 00 to 12 AM correctly. The program should convert `00:xx` to `12:xx AM`, but it does this only for the specific case of `00`. This is a minor issue, but it is handled correctly in the program.

The program also correctly handles the minutes, which remain unchanged in the conversion.

Given that the program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem, and the input is assumed to be valid, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
