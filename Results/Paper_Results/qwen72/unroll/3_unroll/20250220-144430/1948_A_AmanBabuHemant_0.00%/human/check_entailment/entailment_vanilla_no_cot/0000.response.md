Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's, which does not meet the criteria of the problem. The program should generate a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors and the string should consist of uppercase Latin letters.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. The problem states that a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which means `n` cannot be 1, as a single character cannot have exactly one neighbor that it is equal to. The program should print 'NO' for `n = 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'A' * (n // 2) + 'B' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version generates a string of uppercase Latin letters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and it correctly handles the case where `n` is odd.
