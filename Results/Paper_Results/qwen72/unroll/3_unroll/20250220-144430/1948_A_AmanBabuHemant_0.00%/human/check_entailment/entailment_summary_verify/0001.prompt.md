You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the string formed by repeating '110' `n // 2` times is 200 or more, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string is less than 200, the function prints "YES" followed by the string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special.
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should be of length at most 200.
   - If no such string can be constructed, we should print "NO".

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n`.
   - For each test case, we need to determine if a valid string can be constructed and print the result accordingly.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO".

4. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern '110' is used to create special characters. In this pattern, the first two '1's are special because they are equal to one of their neighbors.
   - Each repetition of '110' adds 2 special characters.
   - Therefore, `n // 2` repetitions of '110' will create exactly `n` special characters.

5. **Length Check:**
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is even and the length of `s` is within the limit by printing "YES" followed by the string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements of the problem. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the length of the string is within the 200-character limit.

### Correctness:
**True**
