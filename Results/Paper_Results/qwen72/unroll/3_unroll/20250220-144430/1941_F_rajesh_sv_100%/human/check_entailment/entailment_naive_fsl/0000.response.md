Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum difference `max_diff` is not reduced by adding any new problem. This can happen if the new problem's complexity is not within the range of the existing complexities. For example, if the existing complexities are `[1, 10, 20, 30]` and the model complexities are `[100]` and function complexities are `[100]`, the new problem's complexity will be `200`, which does not help in reducing the maximum difference. In such a case, the program should output the original `max_diff` if it cannot be reduced, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input complexities are already balanced, and adding a new problem does not change the imbalance.
