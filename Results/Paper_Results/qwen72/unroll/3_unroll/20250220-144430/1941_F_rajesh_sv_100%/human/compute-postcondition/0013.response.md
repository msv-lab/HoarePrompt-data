The function `func_6` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5.
- `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1].
- `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `m` integers where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9.
- `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9.

The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to operate on the given lists and integers and return a result based on the defined constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function operates on three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific constraints, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
