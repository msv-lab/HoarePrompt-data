To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`A`**: This is a list of integers.
2. **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These are some integer values, but their exact values are not provided.
3. **`D`**: This is a sorted list of unique integers.
4. **`F`**: This is a list of `k` integers.
5. **`max_diff`**: This is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`.
6. **`next_max_diff`**: This is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`.
7. **`index`**: This is the index in `A` where the maximum difference occurs.
8. **`left`**: This is the element in `A` at the index `index - 1`.
9. **`right`**: This is the element in `A` at the index `index`.
10. **`ans`**: This is the minimum value of the maximum differences calculated for each `f` in `F`.

The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`max_diff` and `next_max_diff`**:
   - `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.
   - `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.

2. **`ans`**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value of the maximum differences calculated for each `f` in `F`.
   - This means that `ans` is the smallest value among the maximum differences obtained when each `f` in `F` is considered.

3. **`max(ans, next_max_diff)`**:
   - The `max` function will compare `ans` and `next_max_diff` and return the larger of the two.
   - Since `ans` is the minimum of the maximum differences for each `f` in `F`, it is possible that `ans` is less than or equal to `next_max_diff`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the larger value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of the maximum differences calculated for each f in F, and next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A)**
