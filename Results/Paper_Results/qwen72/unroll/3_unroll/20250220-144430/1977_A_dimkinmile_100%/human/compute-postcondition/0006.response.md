The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it is incomplete. Assuming the correct definition is `def func_1(n, m):`, the function should return a value based on the parameters `n` and `m`. Since the output is not specified, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional information.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters `n` and `m`, both integers within the range 1 to 100. The function's output is not specified, so its exact functionality cannot be determined.**
