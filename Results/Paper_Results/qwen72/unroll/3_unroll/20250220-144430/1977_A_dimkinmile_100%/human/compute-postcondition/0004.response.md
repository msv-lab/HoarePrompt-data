Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- They are assigned values from the input.
- Either \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\)**:
   - This means that the difference between `n` and `m` is not divisible by 2, i.e., it is an odd number.
   
2. **Condition 2: \(n - m < 0\)**:
   - This means that `n` is less than `m`.

3. **Combined Condition**:
   - The initial state guarantees that at least one of these conditions is true. This means that the difference between `n` and `m` is either odd or negative (or both).

### Conclusion:
- Since the initial state ensures that either \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\) (or both), the code snippet will always execute the `print('No')` statement.

### Output:
Output: **No**
