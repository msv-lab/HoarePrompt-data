### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Correctness**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves must be even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed to build the tower. This is necessary because Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis of Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case. The function should read `n` and `m` from the input, where both integers are within the range 1 to 100.
- **State inside the function**:
  - `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed.
  - If both conditions are met, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No" is printed.
- **State after the function call**:
  - The program state reflects the result of the condition check as either "Yes" or "No" being printed.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and reasoning behind the program.
- The conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are indeed necessary and sufficient to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
