Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n < m`. According to the problem description, it should output "No" if `n < m` because it is impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes with fewer than `m` moves. However, the program does not check for this condition and may incorrectly output "Yes" in such cases. For example, if the input is `2 3`, the program will output "Yes" instead of "No".
