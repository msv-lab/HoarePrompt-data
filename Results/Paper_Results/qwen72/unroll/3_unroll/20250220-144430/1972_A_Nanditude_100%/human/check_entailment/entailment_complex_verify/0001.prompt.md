You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

    #State: The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been executed. The variable `n` is the last input integer value read for the number of elements in the lists. The lists `a` and `b` are the last input lists of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` for the last iteration. The variable `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the first element in `b` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of inputs from the user. It first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` has been decremented to 0, `n` holds the last input integer value for the number of elements in the lists, and `a` and `b` hold the last input lists of `n` integers. The variable `cnt` holds the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` for the last iteration, and `i` holds the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the first element in `b` for the last iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of proposed problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to zero, which will keep track of the number of new problems needed.
   - It also initializes an index `i` to zero, which will be used to track the position in the array `a`.

3. **Looping Through `b`**:
   - The program iterates through the array `b` using a loop variable `j`.
   - For each element `b[j]` in `b`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than the current element `a[i]` in `a`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult and a new problem needs to be proposed. The counter `cnt` is incremented.
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is acceptable, and the index `i` is incremented to move to the next problem in `a`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in `b`, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies when a problem in `a` is too difficult by comparing it with the corresponding problem in `b`.
  - The counter `cnt` is incremented each time a problem in `a` is too difficult, and the index `i` is incremented when a problem is acceptable.
  - However, the program does not actually insert new problems or sort the array `a` after each insertion. Instead, it relies on the fact that both `a` and `b` are already sorted and uses a greedy approach to count the number of new problems needed.

- **Greedy Approach**:
  - The greedy approach works because both `a` and `b` are sorted. By iterating through `b` and comparing with `a`, the program can determine the minimum number of new problems needed without explicitly performing the insertions and deletions.
  - This approach ensures that the number of new problems is minimized, as it always tries to match the most difficult acceptable problem in `b` with the least difficult problem in `a`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (i.e., no new problems are needed).
  - It also handles the case where all problems in `a` are too difficult, requiring the maximum number of new problems.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem description. It correctly determines the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

### Correctness:
**True**
