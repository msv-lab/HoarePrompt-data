Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a single string `s` from user input, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 characters. It then processes this string to find the longest substring that is repeated at a distance of `j` (where `j` is a positive integer less than or equal to half the length of `s`) and contains only question marks or matching characters. If such a substring is found, it prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such substring is found, it prints `0` and returns. The function does not modify the input string or any other variables. **
