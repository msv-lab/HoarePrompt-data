The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it is implied that the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (size of the list), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of integers). For each test case, it processes the list `a` and the integer `k` according to the constraints and returns a result.**
