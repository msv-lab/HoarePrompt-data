Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. The variable `t` has been exhausted, and the final output for each test case is printed. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not retained between test cases, so they are reset for each iteration. The final state of `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are undefined after the loop completes.**
