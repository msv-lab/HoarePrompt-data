The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (t, n, k, and a) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
