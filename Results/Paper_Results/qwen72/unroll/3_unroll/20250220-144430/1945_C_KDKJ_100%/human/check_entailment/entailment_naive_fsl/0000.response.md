Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first reads the number of houses and their preferences for living on the left or right side of the road. It then constructs a prefix sum array `S` to keep track of the cumulative count of residents who prefer the left side (0) and the right side (1) up to each house. The program iterates through all possible positions to place the road and checks if the condition of having at least half of the residents on each side satisfied is met. If the condition is met, it updates the answer to the position that is closest to the middle of the village. The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the road is placed before the first house or after the last house. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
