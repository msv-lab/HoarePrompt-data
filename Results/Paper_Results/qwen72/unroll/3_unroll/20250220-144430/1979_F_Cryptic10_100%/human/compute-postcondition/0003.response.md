The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it interacts with a pre-defined graph for each test case. The graph is a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices and `(n - 2)` edges removed. The input `n` for each test case satisfies `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and the total number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`. The function can make at most `n` queries of the form "? d" to determine the structure of the graph. After determining a Hamiltonian path, the function outputs the path in the form "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n".
