Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices from 1 to `n` and an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

2. **Querying the Graph**:
   - The function uses a loop to repeatedly query the graph until only 2 vertices remain in `vx`.
   - The query `q(len(vx) - 2)` asks for a vertex with a degree of at least `len(vx) - 2` and another vertex that is not connected to it.
   - The vertex `v1` is removed from `vx` after each query.
   - If `v2` is greater than 0, it means there is a vertex not connected to `v1`, and the pair `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`.
   - If `v2` is 0, it means `v1` is connected to all remaining vertices. In this case, an additional query `q(0)` is made to find a vertex with the minimum degree, which is then removed from `vx` and added to `ops` along with `v1`.

3. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path**:
   - Once only 2 vertices remain in `vx`, they are stored in the list `p1`.
   - The function then reconstructs the Hamiltonian path by iterating over the operations in `ops` in reverse order.
   - For each operation `(v1, v2)`, the vertex `v1` is appended to `p1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise it is appended to `p2`.
   - Finally, the Hamiltonian path is printed by concatenating `p1` in reverse order with `p2`.

4. **Query Limit**:
   - The function ensures that it makes at most `n` queries per test case by removing vertices and updating the set `vx` accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `v2` is 0 correctly by making an additional query to find a vertex with the minimum degree.
   - The function also handles the case where only 2 vertices remain by directly adding them to `p1`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The final Hamiltonian path is printed in the required format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n".

Given the problem constraints and the behavior described in the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding a Hamiltonian path in the modified graph using the specified queries.

Correctness: **True**
