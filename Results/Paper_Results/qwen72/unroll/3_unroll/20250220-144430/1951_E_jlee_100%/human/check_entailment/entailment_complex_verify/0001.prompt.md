You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the required output based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will have their final values after the last iteration, but these values are not significant outside the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the list `s` will contain the last processed string as a list of characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string from the input. The function determines if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If the string cannot be split in this manner, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t` and the list of strings are not modified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the program correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the program correctly prints "YES" and the string itself as a single non-palindromic substring. This is valid because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the program correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the program checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single non-palindromic substring.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program then iterates through the string to find the first and second characters that are different from the first character `x`.
   - If it finds such characters, it attempts to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic for partitioning is complex and involves checking the positions of these different characters and ensuring that the resulting substrings are not palindromic.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as strings with all identical characters, strings with one different character, and strings with different first and last characters correctly.
   - However, the logic for partitioning in the general case is overly complex and may not cover all possible valid partitions.

### Issues:
- **Complexity and Redundancy:**
  - The logic for partitioning in the general case is overly complex and may not be necessary. A simpler approach could be used to partition the string.
  - For example, if the string has at least two different characters, it can always be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings by splitting at the first occurrence of the second different character.

- **Potential Bugs:**
  - The program may not correctly handle cases where the string has more than one different character but the logic fails to find a valid partition.

### Simplified Approach:
- **Single Character String:**
  - If the string has only one character, print "NO".
- **Different First and Last Character:**
  - If the first and last characters are different, print "YES" and the string itself.
- **All Characters are the Same:**
  - If all characters are the same, print "NO".
- **General Case:**
  - If the string has at least two different characters, find the first occurrence of the second different character and split the string at that point. This will ensure that both resulting substrings are non-palindromic.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** due to its overly complex and potentially flawed logic for partitioning in the general case. A simpler and more robust approach is needed.

### Correctness:
**False**
