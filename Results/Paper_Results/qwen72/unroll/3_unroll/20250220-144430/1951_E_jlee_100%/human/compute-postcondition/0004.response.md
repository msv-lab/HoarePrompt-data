Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string from the input. The function determines if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If the string cannot be split in this manner, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t` and the list of strings are not modified. **
