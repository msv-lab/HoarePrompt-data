You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should return the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop will print either 2 or 3 for each test case, depending on whether there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other. The variables `n`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` will be in their final states after the loop has executed, but their specific values will depend on the input. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, `x` will be the last input value for the number of friends in the current test case, `l` will be the last list of best friends for the current test case, and `flag` will be `True` if a pair of mutual best friends was found in the last test case, otherwise it will not be set or will remain `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`, and returns the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
