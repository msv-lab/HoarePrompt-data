### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \), which contains the distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints the coordinates of \( n \) cells.
   - The program always prints the cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 4)\) and then prints cells \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output for Different \( n \):**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has size 2.
     - This is correct as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 2 \) is 2.

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |3-1| = 3 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |3-2| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 4.
     - This is correct as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 3 \) is 4.

   - **For \( n = 4 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-1| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-2| = 3 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-1| = 6 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-2| = 5 \)
       - \( |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has size 7.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 4 \) should be 10.

   - **For \( n = 5 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-1| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-2| = 3 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-1| = 6 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-2| = 5 \)
       - \( |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |5-1| + |5-1| = 8 \)
       - \( |5-1| + |5-2| = 7 \)
       - \( |5-2| + |5-4| = 5 \)
       - \( |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has size 9.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 5 \) should be 13.

   - **For \( n = 6 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-1| = 4 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |4-2| = 3 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-1| = 6 \)
       - \( |4-1| + |4-2| = 5 \)
       - \( |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |5-1| + |5-1| = 8 \)
       - \( |5-1| + |5-2| = 7 \)
       - \( |5-2| + |5-4| = 5 \)
       - \( |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |6-1| + |6-1| = 10 \)
       - \( |6-1| + |6-2| = 9 \)
       - \( |6-2| + |6-4| = 6 \)
       - \( |6-4| + |6-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |6-5| + |6-5| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has size 11.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 6 \) should be 16.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n > 3 \). It fails to generate the required number of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of \( n \).

Final: **False**
