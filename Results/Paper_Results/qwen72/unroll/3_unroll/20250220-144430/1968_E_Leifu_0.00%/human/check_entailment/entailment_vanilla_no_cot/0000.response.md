Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze why:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct and has a size of 2.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct and has a size of 4.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which is correct and has a size of 7.

4. **For \(n = 5\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which is correct and has a size of 9.

5. **For \(n = 6\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which is correct and has a size of 11.

However, the program does not handle the general case for \(n \geq 4\) correctly. For \(n \geq 4\), the program always prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 3 to \(n\). This does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this arrangement is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which also has a size of 7, but the program does not consistently produce such optimal arrangements for all \(n \geq 4\).

For \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
5 5
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
1 5
5 1
5 5
3 3
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this arrangement is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which also has a size of 9, but the program does not consistently produce such optimal arrangements for all \(n \geq 5\).

Therefore, the program is not correct for all values of \(n\), especially for \(n \geq 4\).
