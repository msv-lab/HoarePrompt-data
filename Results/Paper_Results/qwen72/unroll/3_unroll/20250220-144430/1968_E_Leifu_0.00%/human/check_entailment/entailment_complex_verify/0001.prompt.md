You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer n as input where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and n represents the size of the grid (n x n) and the number of cells to choose.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print '1 1', '1 2', and then either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by a sequence of numbers from 4 to `n` inclusive, where each number is printed as 'j j'. The value of `n` will be updated based on the input provided for each iteration, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function then prints a series of coordinates for each test case. Specifically, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and if `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by a sequence of coordinates from '4 4' to 'n n'. The function performs these actions for each of the `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer \( n \) and need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The goal is to maximize the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \), which contains the distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints the coordinates of \( n \) cells.
   - The program always prints the cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 4)\) and then prints cells \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output for Different \( n \):**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has size 2.
     - This is correct as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 2 \) is 2.

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |3-1| = 3 \)
       - \( |2-1| + |3-2| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 4.
     - This is correct as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 3 \) is 4.

   - **For \( n = 4 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)

       - \( |4-1| + |4-2| = 5 \)
       - \( |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has size 7.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 4 \) should be 10.

   - **For \( n = 5 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)

       - \( |5-1| + |5-2| = 7 \)
       - \( |5-2| + |5-4| = 5 \)
       - \( |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has size 9.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 5 \) should be 13.

   - **For \( n = 6 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) contains the distances:

       - \( |5-1| + |5-2| = 7 \)
       - \( |5-2| + |5-4| = 5 \)
       - \( |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |6-1| + |6-1| = 10 \)
       - \( |6-1| + |6-2| = 9 \)
       - \( |6-2| + |6-4| = 6 \)
       - \( |6-4| + |6-4| = 2 \)
       - \( |6-5| + |6-5| = 2 \)
     - The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has size 11.
     - This is incorrect as the maximum size of \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n = 6 \) should be 16.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \) for \( n > 3 \). It fails to generate the required number of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of \( n \).
