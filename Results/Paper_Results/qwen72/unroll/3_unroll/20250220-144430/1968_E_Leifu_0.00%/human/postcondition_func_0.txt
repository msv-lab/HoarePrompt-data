The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function then prints a series of coordinates for each test case. Specifically, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and if `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by a sequence of coordinates from '4 4' to 'n n'. The function performs these actions for each of the `t` test cases.
