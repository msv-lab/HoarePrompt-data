The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 by default when the loop begins. The condition that `2 <= n <= 10^3` is not directly related to the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. However, it is part of the initial state and should be mentioned.

State: **`2 <= n <= 10^3`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
