Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print '1 1', '1 2', and then either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by a sequence of numbers from 4 to `n` inclusive, where each number is printed as 'j j'. The value of `n` will be updated based on the input provided for each iteration, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.**
