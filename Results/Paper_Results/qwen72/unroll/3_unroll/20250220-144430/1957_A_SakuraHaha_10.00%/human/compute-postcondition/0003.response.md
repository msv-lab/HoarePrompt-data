Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the creation of an empty dictionary `cnt`.
