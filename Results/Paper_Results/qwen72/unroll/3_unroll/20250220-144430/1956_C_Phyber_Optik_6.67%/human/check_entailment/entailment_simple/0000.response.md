Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix by performing a limited number of operations (up to \(2n\)). The operations involve setting a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) for each row and each column. This is because the sum of the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
   - If we fill all \(n\) rows and all \(n\) columns with this permutation, the sum of the matrix will be \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \(n\).
   - It initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), and for each \(i\), it checks if \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) (the sum of the permutation) is greater than \(i \times n\).
   - If the condition is true, it increments `sum` by \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) and sets `r` to \(i\).
   - If the condition is false, it increments `sum` by \(i \times n\).
   - Finally, it prints `sum` and `n + r` as the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations: the first `n` lines are Type 1 operations (rows), and the remaining lines are Type 2 operations (columns).

4. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `sum` and `r` is flawed. The condition \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i \times n\) is always true for \(i < n\), and false for \(i = n\). This means `r` will always be \(n-1\) and `sum` will be \((n-1) \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n \times n\), which is not the correct maximum sum.
   - The correct maximum sum should be \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), which is achieved by filling all rows and columns with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the correct number of operations, which is \(2n\), but the sum calculation is incorrect.
   - The operations themselves are correct in terms of format and the permutations used, but the sum is not maximized as intended.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The operations are correctly formatted but do not achieve the intended maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
