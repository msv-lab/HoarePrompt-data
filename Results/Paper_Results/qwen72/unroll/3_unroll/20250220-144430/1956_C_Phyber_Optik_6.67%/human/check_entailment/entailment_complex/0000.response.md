### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row and replace its elements with a permutation of \( 1 \) to \( n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column and replace its elements with a permutation of \( 1 \) to \( n \).
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) because each element in the matrix can be set to a value from \( 1 \) to \( n \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates `sum` and `r` based on a condition:
     - If \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i \times n \), it adds \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to `sum` and sets `r` to \( i \).
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - It prints `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It prints `n + r` lines of operations:
     - The first \( n \) lines are Type 1 operations, setting each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - The remaining lines are Type 2 operations, setting each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Sum Calculation**:
     - The program's logic for calculating `sum` is incorrect. It should simply be \( n^2 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) because each element in the matrix can be set to a value from 1 to \( n \).
     - The current logic does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum.
   - **Number of Operations**:
     - The program prints \( n + r \) operations, which is not always correct. The maximum number of operations should be \( 2n \).
     - The logic for determining `r` is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The maximum sum is \( n^2 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - To achieve this sum, you can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to set each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and then \( n \) Type 2 operations to set each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and does not ensure that the number of operations is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
