The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The function should return the appropriate output for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
