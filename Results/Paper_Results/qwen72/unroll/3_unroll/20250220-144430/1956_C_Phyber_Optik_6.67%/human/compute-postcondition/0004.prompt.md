You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop will read an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) from the user. After the loop finishes, the variables `sum` and `r` will be calculated and printed for each test case. The variable `sum` will be the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition. Additionally, for each test case, the loop will print a series of lines where the first line is `sum` and `n + r`, followed by `n + r` lines. The first `n` lines will print `1` followed by the line number and the range from 1 to `n`. The remaining lines will print `2` followed by the line number modulo `n` and the range from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
