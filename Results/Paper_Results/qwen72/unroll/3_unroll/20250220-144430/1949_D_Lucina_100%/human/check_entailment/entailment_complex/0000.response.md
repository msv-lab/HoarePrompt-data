Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing the transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column) of the matrix, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an extra empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Characters**:
   - The function iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' character found.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` correctly reflect the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the i-th row (and column).

3. **Categorizing Rows**:
   - The function categorizes rows into two lists: `sa` for rows with 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, and `sb` for rows with 'S' characters but no 'F' characters.
   - This categorization helps in deciding how to replace the '?' characters later.

4. **Handling Unassigned Transitions**:
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the function appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa`.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the function appends these rows to `sb`.
   - This ensures that the function has a balanced approach to assigning 'F' and 'S' to the remaining '?' characters.

5. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - The function iterates through the matrix again and constructs the output strings.
   - If a character is not '?', it is appended to the output string as is.
   - If a character is '?', the function decides whether to replace it with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in `sa` or `sb` and their positions in the matrix.
   - Specifically, if the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (or `sb`), it replaces '?' with 'F' (or 'S'). Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'S' (or 'F').

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the output is symmetric and respects the constraints.

**Potential Issues**:
- The logic for replacing '?' characters is based on the first quarter of `sa` or `sb`, which might not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters are present in any permutation of scenarios.
- The function does not explicitly check the final output to ensure it meets the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters.

**Conclusion**:
- While the function attempts to balance the assignment of 'F' and 'S' characters, it does not guarantee that the output will always satisfy the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters in any permutation of scenarios.
- Therefore, the function might not always produce a correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
