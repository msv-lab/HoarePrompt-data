You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with the diagonal elements always being '.'. It reads the matrix from user input and counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row (and column) of the matrix. The function then categorizes rows into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, where `sa` contains rows with 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, and `sb` contains rows with 'S' characters but no 'F' characters. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, it appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa`. Otherwise, it appends these rows to `sb`. Finally, it prints a modified version of the matrix, replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the content of `sa` or `sb` and the position of the '?' in the matrix. The function does not return any value, but it modifies and prints the matrix.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which represents the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Known Transitions**:
   - For each scenario `i`, the program reads the input string `x` and iterates through each character `j` in the string.
   - If the character is 'F', it increments the count in `a` for both `i` and `j`.
   - If the character is 'S', it increments the count in `b` for both `i` and `j`.
   - The input string `x` is appended to the list `xx`.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through all scenarios and appends the indices to `sa` if they have only funny transitions and to `sb` if they have only scary transitions.

4. **Assigning Unknown Transitions**:
   - The program checks if the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
   - If `sa` is longer, it appends the indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
   - It then iterates through each scenario `i` and constructs the new transition string `nx` for each scenario.
   - For each transition `j`:
     - If the transition is already known (not '?'), it is added to `nx` as is.
     - If the transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, it assigns 'F'.
     - Otherwise, it assigns 'S'.
   - If `sb` is longer, it appends the indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sb`.
   - It then follows a similar process to construct the new transition string `nx`, but assigns 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` and 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the new transition string `nx` for each scenario.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Transition Assignment**:
  - The program aims to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are allowed.
  - By assigning 'F' or 'S' to the unknown transitions based on the length of `sa` and `sb`, the program tries to balance the number of consecutive transitions.
  - However, the logic for assigning transitions to avoid more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions is not robust. The condition `n // 4 - 1` is incorrect and can lead to more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is very small or very large.
  - The logic for appending indices to `sa` and `sb` and then assigning transitions based on these lists may not always result in a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for assigning unknown transitions is flawed and may not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are allowed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
