Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incomplete Handling of Undecided Transitions**:
   - The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions ('?') based on the lists `sa` and `sb`, which are supposed to contain scenarios with only 'F' or only 'S' transitions, respectively. However, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to these transitions is flawed and does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for any permutation of the scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Assigning Transitions**:
   - The program uses the condition `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` to decide whether to assign 'F' or 'S'. This logic is not sufficient to ensure the required constraint. It only considers a subset of the scenarios and does not account for the overall sequence of transitions.

3. **Handling of Symmetry**:
   - The program does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions. While the input guarantees symmetry, the output must also maintain this property.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the number of scenarios is small or when the number of pre-decided transitions is exactly \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\).

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible approach is to use a backtracking algorithm to ensure that the constraints are met for all permutations of the scenarios. This would involve trying different assignments for the undecided transitions and checking if the resulting sequence of transitions satisfies the constraint for all permutations.

Here is a corrected version of the program that uses a backtracking approach:

```python
def is_valid(matrix, n):
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if matrix[perm[i-1]][perm[i]] == matrix[perm[i]][perm[i-1]]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 1
            if count > (3 * n) // 4:
                return False
    return True

def backtrack(matrix, n, i, j):
    if i == n:
        return is_valid(matrix, n)
    if j == n:
        return backtrack(matrix, n, i + 1, i + 2)
    if matrix[i][j] == '?':
        for c in ['F', 'S']:
            matrix[i][j] = c
            matrix[j][i] = c
            if backtrack(matrix, n, i, j + 1):
                return True
            matrix[i][j] = '?'
            matrix[j][i] = '?'
    else:
        return backtrack(matrix, n, i, j + 1)
    return False

def func():
    from itertools import permutations
    n = int(input())
    matrix = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Ensure the matrix is symmetric
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[j][i]:
                matrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
    
    # Use backtracking to assign the undecided transitions
    if backtrack(matrix, n, 0, 1):
        for row in matrix:
            print(''.join(row))
    else:
        print("No solution found")

func()
```

This corrected version uses a backtracking algorithm to try all possible assignments of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions and checks if the resulting matrix satisfies the constraint for all permutations of the scenarios. If a valid solution is found, it prints the matrix; otherwise, it indicates that no solution was found.
