Output State: **The list `sb` will contain the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0, as well as the indices of all rows (1 to n) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sa` and the lists `xx`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will still be less than the length of `sb`. After the loop, the printed output will be a series of strings `nx` where each string `nx` is constructed by replacing '?' characters in `xx[i]` with 'S' if the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.**
