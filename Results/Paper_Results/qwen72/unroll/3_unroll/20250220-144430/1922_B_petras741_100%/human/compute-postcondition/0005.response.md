Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the exponents of their lengths are the same or form a non-decreasing sequence. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0 for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variable `buffer` remains an empty list, while `t` (the number of test cases) is unchanged. **
