The function `func` is expected to take input parameters as described in the problem, but the actual function definition is missing these parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. Each `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers within the range of the permutation, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of positive integers.
