Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha using a loop. However, the logic for updating the scores is flawed. The program updates `bm` and `sm` using the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which is incorrect. The score should be accumulated over each turn, not recalculated based on the remaining turns.

2. **Incorrect Loop Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, but the loop variable `k` is being decremented inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the loop is not properly managed.

3. **Incorrect Movement Logic:**
   - The program moves the players to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` in each turn, which is incorrect. The players should move to `p[b]` and `p[s]` directly, without subtracting 1, as the positions are 1-indexed in the problem statement.

4. **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
   - The program should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns and then compare the final scores. The current logic does not correctly simulate the game for the full duration of `k` turns.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Simulate the game for exactly `k` turns.
- Track the positions and scores of both Bodya and Sasha.
- Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust for 0-indexing
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            
            # Move to the next position
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game for `k` turns and updates the scores accordingly. It then compares the final scores to determine the winner.
