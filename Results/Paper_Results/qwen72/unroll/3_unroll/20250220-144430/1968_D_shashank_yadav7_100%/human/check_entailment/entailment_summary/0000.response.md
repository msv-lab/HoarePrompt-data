Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the "Permutation game" problem, where Bodya and Sasha play a game on a permutation and an array to accumulate scores over a fixed number of turns. The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

However, there are a few issues in the program that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Scores**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bm` and `sm`) by iterating through the permutation and updating the scores based on the current position and the remaining number of turns.
   - The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines are incorrect because they do not properly account for the dynamic nature of the game. The scores `bm` and `sm` should be updated based on the actual moves and positions, not just the remaining number of turns.

2. **Incorrect Loop Termination**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, but the loop variable `k` is decremented inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect termination. The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, and the loop variable should be a separate counter.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect. The permutation `p` is 1-based, so the positions should be updated as `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` only once to convert them to 0-based indices. After that, the positions should be updated as `p[b]` and `p[s]` without the `- 1`.

4. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated correctly, but the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` are not. The maximum scores should be the final scores after `k` turns, not the intermediate values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
