Reasoning:

The provided function `func` attempts to solve the "Permutation game" problem by simulating the game for each test case. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to determine if the function is correct:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but it should. The function should accept the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. This is a minor issue and can be fixed by adding the parameters to the function definition.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates `k` times, but the variable `k` is decremented within the loop, which is not necessary. The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, and `k` should remain unchanged.

3. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively. However, the logic for updating these scores is incorrect. The function should simulate the game by following the rules:
   - On each turn, the score of a player increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`.
   - The player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.

   The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game because it updates `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible values based on the current and previous values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` multiplied by `k`, which does not follow the game rules. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores based on the moves.

4. **Permutation Handling**: The permutation `p` is 1-based, but the function converts it to 0-based by subtracting 1 from the indices. This is correct, but the logic for moving the players based on the permutation should be more clearly defined.

5. **Output**: The function prints the results for each test case, which is correct. However, the logic for determining the winner is based on the incorrect score calculation.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
