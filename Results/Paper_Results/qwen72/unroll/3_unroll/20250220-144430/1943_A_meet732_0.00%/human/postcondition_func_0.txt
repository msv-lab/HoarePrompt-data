The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. If there are no zeros in the list, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) such that the count of `j` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `n` and `a` will retain their values from the last test case, and `cntl` will be a list of counts for the last test case.
