### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The function initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count of each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX**:
   - The function checks if `0` is not present in `a` (i.e., `cntl[0] == 0`). If `0` is not present, the MEX of `c` will be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` is present, it initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The function then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of any integer `j` in `cntl` is less than `2`.
   - If `cntl[j] < 2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last integer (`j == n`). If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of MEX Calculation**:
  - The function correctly identifies the MEX by checking the presence of each integer starting from `0`.
  - If `0` is not present, the MEX is `0`.
  - If `0` is present, it ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s, and Bob can pick at most one `0` if available.
  - The loop then checks for the smallest integer `j` that is missing from `c` by ensuring that `cntl[j] < 2` (since Alice and Bob can each pick at most one of each integer).

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The function correctly simulates the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
  - The logic ensures that the game ends when all elements are picked, and the MEX of `c` is correctly calculated based on the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly calculates the MEX for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
