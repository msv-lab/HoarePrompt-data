### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means 0 is not in the array `a`, and the MEX of `c` will be 0. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, Alice cannot add 0 to `c`, and thus the MEX of `c` will be 0.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can add at most 2 zeros to `c` if they are available.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means Bob can prevent Alice from adding both instances of `j` to `c` (if `j` appears twice in `a`).
     - The program decrements `c` by 1 for each such element.
     - If `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Alice will always try to add the smallest available integer to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from adding the smallest available integer to `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the point where Alice can no longer add the smallest integer to `c` due to Bob's optimal play.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where 0 is not in the array by immediately printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array by correctly identifying the MEX.

8. **Verification with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program processes each test case correctly.
   - The `cntl` list is reset for each test case, ensuring that the counts are accurate for each individual test.
   - The loop correctly iterates through the elements and applies the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
