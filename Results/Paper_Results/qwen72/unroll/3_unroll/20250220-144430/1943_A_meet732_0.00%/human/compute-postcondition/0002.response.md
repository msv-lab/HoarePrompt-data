The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The integer `n` must be within the range 1 to 200,000, and each integer `a_i` must be within the range 0 to `n-1`. The total number of test cases, `t`, must be between 1 and 20,000, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases must not exceed 200,000.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result is determined based on the input list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for the respective test case.
