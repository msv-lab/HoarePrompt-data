It seems there's a misunderstanding in the function definition provided for the given problem description. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition given is `def func():`. I will provide the precondition based on the problem description and the correct function definition.

Problem description: Write a function to generate files for HTML files in a range of subfolders. The function should:
- Get the current directory and list all subfolders.
- Check if the subfolder names are within the specified range and are numeric.
- For each subfolder within the range, list all `.html` files.
- For each `.html` file, create two new files: one with `-ac.py` and another with `-wa.py` as suffixes.
- Print the number of HTML files in each subfolder and the names of the generated files.

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
