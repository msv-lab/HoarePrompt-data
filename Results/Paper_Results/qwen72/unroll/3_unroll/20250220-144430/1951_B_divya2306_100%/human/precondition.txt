The function `win` should take parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the number of cows and the index of your cow (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `a` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, all a_i are distinct). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
