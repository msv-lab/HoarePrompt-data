Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's being pairwise different). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def max_wins(t, test_cases, ratings):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, k) and `ratings` is a list of lists containing the ratings for each test case.
