The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `k` (the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively), and a list `a` of Cowdeforces ratings. It calculates the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to your cow's rating (`a[k-1]`) up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered. If this number (`wins`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be swapped to increase your cow's position and prints this value. The function does not return any value. The input parameters `t`, `cows_info`, and `ratings` are not directly used within the function, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function call.
