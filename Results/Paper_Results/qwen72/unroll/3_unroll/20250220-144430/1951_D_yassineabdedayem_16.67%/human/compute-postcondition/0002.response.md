Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` are read from input. The loop modifies `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` within the while loop. After the while loop, `n` is reduced to a value that is either 0 or less than `k`, `k` is reduced to a non-positive value or remains positive if `n` is less than `k`, `rep` is incremented up to 60, `number` holds the last value appended to `tab`, and `tab` contains a list of strings representing the values of `number` appended during the loop. If `k` is 0, the loop prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the loop prints 'NO'. The variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` are reset for each test case.**
