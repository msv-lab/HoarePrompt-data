Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it attempts to reduce `n` by repeatedly subtracting the product of the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k` from `n`, while also decrementing `k` by the minimum of these two values. This process is repeated up to 60 times or until `n` is less than `k` or `k` becomes non-positive. If `k` reaches 0, the function prints 'YES', the number of operations performed, and the sequence of numbers representing the operations. If `k` is still positive after the process, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console. **
