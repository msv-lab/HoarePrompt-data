You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` are read from input. The loop modifies `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` within the while loop. After the while loop, `n` is reduced to a value that is either 0 or less than `k`, `k` is reduced to a non-positive value or remains positive if `n` is less than `k`, `rep` is incremented up to 60, `number` holds the last value appended to `tab`, and `tab` contains a list of strings representing the values of `number` appended during the loop. If `k` is 0, the loop prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the loop prints 'NO'. The variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` are reset for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and needs to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and buying as many jewels as possible at each stall before moving to the next.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls set up, `number` to store the price per jewel, and `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.
   - The program enters a loop where it tries to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab`, subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`, and increments `rep`.
   - The loop continues until `n` is zero, `k` is zero, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The loop ensures that `k` is reduced by the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall.
   - The condition `n * Min <= k` is used to ensure that Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding the number of coins.
   - The loop also ensures that `rep` does not exceed 60, which is the maximum number of stalls Bob can set up.

4. **Output:**
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop and printing "NO".
   - It also handles the case where `k` is zero by printing "YES" and the stall prices.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The loop runs at most 60 times, which is within the constraints.
   - The operations inside the loop are simple arithmetic and list operations, which are efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the stalls and prices appropriately. The conditions and edge cases are handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
