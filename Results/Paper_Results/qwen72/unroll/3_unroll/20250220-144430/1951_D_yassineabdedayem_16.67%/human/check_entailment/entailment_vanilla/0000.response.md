### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice has \( n \) coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \( 10^{18} \).
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a counter \( rep \) to track the number of stalls and a list \( tab \) to store the prices of the stalls.
   - The program uses a while loop to set up the stalls until one of the following conditions is met:
     - \( n \) (remaining coins) is 0.
     - \( k \) (remaining jewels to buy) is 0.
     - \( rep \) (number of stalls) reaches 60.
     - \( n \) is less than \( k \) (not enough coins to buy the remaining jewels).

3. **Stall Price Calculation**:
   - Inside the loop, it calculates \( \text{Min} \) and \( \text{Max} \) as the minimum and maximum of \( n // k \) and \( k \).
   - If \( \text{Max} \) equals \( k \) and \( n \times \text{Min} \leq k \), it sets the price of the stall to \( \text{Min} \) and reduces \( k \) by \( \text{Max} \).
   - Otherwise, it sets the price of the stall to \( \text{Max} \) and reduces \( k \) by \( \text{Min} \).
   - It appends the price to the list \( tab \) and updates \( n \) by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought at the current stall.
   - It increments the stall counter \( rep \).

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if \( k \) is 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If \( k \) is not 0, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints of \( n \) and \( k \) being up to \( 10^{18} \).
   - It ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
   - The logic for setting the prices of the stalls is designed to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels, but it needs to be verified if it always works as intended.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for setting \( \text{Min} \) and \( \text{Max} \) and updating \( n \) and \( k \) is complex and might not always correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - The condition \( n \times \text{Min} \leq k \) is not necessary and might lead to incorrect stall prices.
   - The program should ensure that \( n \) is always sufficient to buy the required number of jewels at each stall.

### Correctness:
After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for setting the prices of the stalls is overly complex and might not always produce the correct result. Specifically, the conditions and updates for \( \text{Min} \) and \( \text{Max} \) are not straightforward and could lead to incorrect stall prices.

A simpler and more straightforward approach would be to set the prices of the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall until she has bought \( k \) jewels. This can be achieved by setting the price of the \( i \)-th stall to \( \lceil n / k \rceil \) and adjusting \( n \) and \( k \) accordingly.

Given the complexity and potential issues in the current logic, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases.

**Correctness: False**
