You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The loop will print the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of each array `nums` for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the last array `nums` processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a` where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case based on the elements of the array for that test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
