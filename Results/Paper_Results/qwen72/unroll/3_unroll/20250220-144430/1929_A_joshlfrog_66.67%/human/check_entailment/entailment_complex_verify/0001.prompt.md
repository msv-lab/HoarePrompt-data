You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

    2 1 3

    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The loop will print the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of each array `nums` for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the last array `nums` processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (2 ≤ l ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `l` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from the input. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the largest element is followed by the smallest element, and this pattern continues.
   - For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1` or `(1 - 3) + (2 - 1) = -2 + 1 = -1`. However, the maximum beauty is achieved by the first arrangement.
   - In general, the maximum beauty is achieved by the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, multiplied by `(n-1)`, because each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` can be maximized by the largest possible difference between any two elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.
   - It then initializes `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element) and `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum and minimum elements.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
   - However, it only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for the optimal arrangement, which is `(max - min) * (n-1)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
