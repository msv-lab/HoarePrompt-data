You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The loop will print the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of each array `nums` for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the last array `nums` processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (2 ≤ l ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `l` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from the input. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the sorted array will have the largest possible differences between consecutive elements, thus maximizing the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the provided program will output 2 - 1 = 1, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The correct output should be 57, which can be achieved by sorting the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and calculating the beauty as (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57. However, the provided program will output 100 - 43 = 57, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason. This does not generalize to other cases where the maximum and minimum values are not the only elements contributing to the beauty.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
