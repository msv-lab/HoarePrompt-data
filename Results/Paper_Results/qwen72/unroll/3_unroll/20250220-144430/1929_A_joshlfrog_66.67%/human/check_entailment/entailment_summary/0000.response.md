Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any order. The beauty is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order, and the maximum beauty is then the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which is \( x - y \) in the program.

The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference for each test case. However, the program does not explicitly sort the array, which might seem like a missing step. Nevertheless, the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array is indeed the maximum possible beauty, regardless of the order of the other elements. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct and it will produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
