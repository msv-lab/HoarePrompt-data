Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def max_beauty(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the elements of the array `a` for a test case.
