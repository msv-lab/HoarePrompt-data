### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem asks to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The beauty of the array is maximized when the difference between consecutive elements is maximized.
   - To maximize the difference, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be the largest possible.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, read the length \(n\) and the array elements.
   - Sort the array in ascending order.
   - Calculate the beauty as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

4. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(l\) and the array elements.
   - It then initializes \(x\) to 0 and \(y\) to a very large number (100000000).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum element \(x\) and the minimum element \(y\).
   - Finally, it prints \(x - y\).

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program only finds the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference.
   - This does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem. The beauty should be the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the same as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array.

**Correctness: False**
