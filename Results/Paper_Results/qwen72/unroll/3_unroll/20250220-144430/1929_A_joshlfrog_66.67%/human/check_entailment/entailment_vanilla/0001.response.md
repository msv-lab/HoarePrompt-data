Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the largest element is followed by the smallest element, and this pattern continues.
   - For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1` or `(1 - 3) + (2 - 1) = -2 + 1 = -1`. However, the maximum beauty is achieved by the first arrangement.
   - In general, the maximum beauty is achieved by the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, multiplied by `(n-1)`, because each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` can be maximized by the largest possible difference between any two elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.
   - It then initializes `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element) and `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum and minimum elements.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
   - However, it only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for the optimal arrangement, which is `(max - min) * (n-1)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
