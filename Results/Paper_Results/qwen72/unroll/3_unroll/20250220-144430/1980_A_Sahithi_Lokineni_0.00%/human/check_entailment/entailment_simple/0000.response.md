Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition**: The program does not define a function `func_1` that matches the problem description. Instead, it directly reads input from the user and processes it within a `while` loop. The function `func_1` is defined but does not perform any useful operations and always returns 0, which is irrelevant to the problem.

2. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with a `default_value` that is not defined. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with an integer default value is to use `int` as the default factory, like `defaultdict(int)`.

3. **Logic for Counting Missing Problems**: The logic for counting the number of problems needed is incorrect. The program should check if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than `m` and then calculate the difference. However, the current logic incorrectly adds `m - d[val]` to `ans` if `d[val] <= m`. This will result in a negative value being added to `ans` if `d[val]` is less than `m`, which is not what we want.

4. **Correct Logic**: The correct logic should be to calculate the total number of problems needed for `m` rounds, which is `7 * m` (since each round requires 7 problems of different difficulties). Then, for each difficulty level, if the number of available problems is less than `m`, add the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program should output the correct number of problems needed for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
