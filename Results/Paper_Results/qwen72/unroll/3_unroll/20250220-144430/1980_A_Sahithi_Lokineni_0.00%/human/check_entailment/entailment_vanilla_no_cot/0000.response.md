Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `default_value`**: The `default_value` function is not defined in the provided code. Instead, it should be `int` or `lambda: 0` to initialize the dictionary with default values of 0.

2. **Logic for calculating the number of problems needed**: The logic for calculating the number of problems needed is incorrect. The program should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and then calculate the total number of problems needed to reach `m` for each difficulty level.

3. **Handling all difficulty levels**: The program should ensure that it checks for all difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and not just the ones present in the input string.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with default value of 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Ensure all difficulty levels are checked
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **`defaultdict(int)`**: This initializes the dictionary with a default value of 0 for any key that is not already present.
- **`for val in 'ABCDEFG'`**: This loop ensures that all difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G' are checked, even if some of them are not present in the input string.
- **`if d[val] < m`**: This condition checks if the count of a particular difficulty level is less than the required number of rounds `m`. If so, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level and adds it to `ans`.

With these changes, the program should correctly solve the problem as described.
