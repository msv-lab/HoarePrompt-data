Reasoning:  
The program's logic has some issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n):

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2]`**: The program checks if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>'. If it is not, it immediately prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot move to the last cell (2, n).

2. **Check for `n == 1`**: The program checks if `n` is 1 and prints 'YES' if true. This is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is always even and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, this condition will never be met, and the check is redundant.

3. **Path Checking Logic**:
   - The program attempts to check if there is a path by iterating over the characters in `b` and `a` in steps of 2. However, the logic is flawed:
     - It first sets `no_path` to `True` and then checks if any even-indexed character in `b` is not '>'. If it finds such a character, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
     - It then resets `no_path` to `True` and checks if any odd-indexed character in `a` (excluding the last character) is not '>'. If it finds such a character, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - The program then prints 'YES' if `no_path` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise. This logic is incorrect because:
     - The robot can move in multiple ways, and the current logic does not account for all possible paths.
     - The robot can move up and down between rows, and the current logic only checks for specific patterns in `a` and `b` without considering the robot's ability to move between rows.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The robot can reach the cell (2, n) if there is a way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows and the rules of movement.
   - The robot can move down to the second row at any column, and then it must follow the arrows in the second row to reach the last column.
   - The program should check if there is any way to move from the first row to the second row and then follow the arrows in the second row to reach the last column.

Given the flaws in the path checking logic and the redundant check for `n == 1`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
