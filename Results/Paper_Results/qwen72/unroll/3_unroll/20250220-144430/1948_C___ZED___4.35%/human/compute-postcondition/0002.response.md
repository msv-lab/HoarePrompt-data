The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a list of integers where each `n[i]` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all `n[i]` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The list of tuples contains pairs of strings, each string consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns the number of cells in the grid where the arrows from the first and second rows point towards each other.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, a list of integers `n`, and a list of tuples containing two strings of length `n[i]` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It returns the number of cells where the arrows from the first and second rows point towards each other.**
