#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n[i] consisting of characters '<' and '>'. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n[i] is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n[i] does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, and no arrow points outside the grid.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reading the integer n and the two strings a and b for each case. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of b is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings a and b. If no path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables t, n, a, and b are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings `a` and `b`. If no valid path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.
