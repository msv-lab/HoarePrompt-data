Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reading the integer n and the two strings a and b for each case. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of b is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings a and b. If no path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables t, n, a, and b are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.**
