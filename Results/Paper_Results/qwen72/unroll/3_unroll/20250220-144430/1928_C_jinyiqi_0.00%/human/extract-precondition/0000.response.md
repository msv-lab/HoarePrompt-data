It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling. Therefore, the correct function definition should be:

```
def find_possible_ks(n, x):
```

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.**
