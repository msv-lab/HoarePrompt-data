Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The list is structured such that the first part contains divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, followed by the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. **
