### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is in a line of students, and he remembers his position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The pattern is: the first `k` positions are numbered `1` to `k`, the next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1` to `2`, and this repeats.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `x`.
   - The output is the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 \leq t \leq 100`
   - `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the pattern.
   - The position `n` can be expressed in terms of `k` and the repeating pattern.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`.
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n + x - 2` is even.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n - x` is even.
   - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective value and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors and appends both `i` and `x / i` to the output lists.
   - The lists are then combined and returned.

7. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
   - It checks if `n + x - 2` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - It checks if `n - x` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - For each divisor, it checks if it can form a valid `k` and appends it to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Function `func_1(x)`**:
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
  - The divisors are found by iterating from `1` to `sqrt(x)` and checking divisibility.
  - The divisors are appended to two lists, one for divisors greater than the square root and one for divisors less than or equal to the square root.
  - The lists are combined and returned, ensuring all divisors are included.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The main logic correctly checks if `n + x - 2` and `n - x` are even.
  - For each even value, it finds the divisors using `func_1`.
  - It then checks if each divisor can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
  - The valid `k` values are appended to the `output` list.
  - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of Divisor Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of `x`, which is essential for the main logic.

- **Correctness of Main Logic**:
  - The main logic correctly checks the conditions for `n + x - 2` and `n - x` being even.
  - The logic for checking if a divisor can form a valid `k` is correct: `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures `s + 2` is even, and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures the `k` value is valid.
  - The use of a set to remove duplicates is appropriate and ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, checks if they can form valid `k` values, and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Final: **True**
