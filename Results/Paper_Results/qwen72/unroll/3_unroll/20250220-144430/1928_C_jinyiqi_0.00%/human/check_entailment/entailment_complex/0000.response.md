### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a pattern of numbering in a line where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given position \( n \) and number \( x \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \) from the input.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - The function `func_1(x)` returns a list of all divisors of \( x \).
   - The program then filters the divisors to find those that are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) by iterating up to the square root of \( x \) and checking divisibility.
   - It returns a list of all divisors, with the smaller divisors in reverse order followed by the larger divisors.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - These conditions are derived from the pattern of the numbering:
     - \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) should be even because the pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The program then filters the divisors to ensure they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), which is necessary for the pattern to fit.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The program also handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given position \( n \) and number \( x \). The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find all divisors, and the main logic correctly filters and processes these divisors to find the valid \( k \) values.

Correctness: **True**
