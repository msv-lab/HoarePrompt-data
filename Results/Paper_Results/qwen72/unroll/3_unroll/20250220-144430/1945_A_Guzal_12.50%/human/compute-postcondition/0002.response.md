Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on user input for each iteration of the loop, and `k` is recalculated for each iteration. The final state of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop, and `k` will be the value calculated in the last iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.**
