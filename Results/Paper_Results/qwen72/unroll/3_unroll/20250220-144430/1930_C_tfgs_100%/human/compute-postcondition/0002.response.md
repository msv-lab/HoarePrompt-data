The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers provided as input. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
