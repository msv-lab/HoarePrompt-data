Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from the set `S` after performing the operations as described. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to track the occurrences of elements in the modified array `a`, but it does not handle the insertion of elements into the set `S` correctly when duplicates are involved. The problem specifies that the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and inserting the same element multiple times should not affect the set.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `b`**: The logic for constructing the array `b` by appending elements and handling the count of duplicates is flawed. The program attempts to fill gaps between sorted elements, but this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically largest result.

3. **Incorrect Use of `cur` and `cnt` Variables**: The variables `cur` and `cnt` are used in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. The variable `cnt` is supposed to track the number of elements that need to be added to `b` to reach the length `n`, but the logic for decrementing `cnt` and incrementing `cur` is not correct.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

- Perform the operations as described, ensuring that the set `S` only contains unique elements.
- After all operations, sort the set `S` in decreasing order to form the array `b`.
- Ensure that the array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This version correctly adds the elements to the set `S` and then sorts the set in decreasing order to form the array `b`. This ensures that the array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.
