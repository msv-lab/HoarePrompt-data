Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**: Remains sorted in descending order.
2. **Variables `n` and `t`**: Remain unchanged.
3. **Counter `counter`**: Contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, and all frequencies are 0.
4. **Variables `cur` and `cnt`**: Both are 0.
5. **List `ans`**: Contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n + cnt`. The additional elements are consecutive integers starting from the last element of `ans` and decreasing by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: Since `a` is sorted in descending order, let's assume `a` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` for the sake of this example. The exact values of `a` are not provided, but we know it is sorted in descending order.
2. **Variables `n` and `t`**: These variables are not used in the `print` statement, so their values are not relevant to the output.
3. **Counter `counter`**: This is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each element in `a`, but all frequencies are 0. This information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
4. **Variables `cur` and `cnt`**: Both are 0, which means no additional elements are inserted into `ans`.
5. **List `ans`**: `ans` is constructed to contain the elements of `a` in descending order. Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are inserted. Therefore, `ans` will be the same as `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the elements of `ans`, which are the same as the elements of `a` in descending order.

### Output:
Output: **5 4 3 2 1 (where `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order)**

This output assumes `a` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. If `a` has different values, the output will reflect those values in descending order.
