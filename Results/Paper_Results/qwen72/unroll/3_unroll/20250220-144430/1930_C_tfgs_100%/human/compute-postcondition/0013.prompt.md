Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` (all frequencies are 0), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
