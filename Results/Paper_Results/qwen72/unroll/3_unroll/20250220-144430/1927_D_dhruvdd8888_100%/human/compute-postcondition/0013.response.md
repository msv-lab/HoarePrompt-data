The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the list.
- `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
- Each query is a pair of integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, representing the indices of the sublist to be processed.

The function returns the results of the queries based on the specified indices `l` and `r` for each test case. The exact nature of the results is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes the sublist `a[l:r]` for each query and returns a value or a list of values corresponding to the queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, and `q` is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers `l` and `r`. The function returns the results of the queries based on the sublist `a[l:r]` for each test case.**
