You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `N` is the same integer value as the input, `nums` is the same list of integers read from `sys.stdin` with `-1` appended to it, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` that contains the same integer, and the integer itself.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `N` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `(l, r)` from the input, processes them according to the conditions in the loop, and prints a pair of integers or `(-1, -1)` based on those conditions. The list `arr` and the variable `N` are not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, and `q` is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers `l` and `r`. The function returns the results of the queries based on the sublist `a[l:r]` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
