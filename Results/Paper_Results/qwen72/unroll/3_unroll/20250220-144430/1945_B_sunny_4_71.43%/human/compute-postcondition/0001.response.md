The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder that will take values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop iterations. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The placeholder `_` is not initialized before the loop, but it will be automatically handled by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` will take values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop iterations**
