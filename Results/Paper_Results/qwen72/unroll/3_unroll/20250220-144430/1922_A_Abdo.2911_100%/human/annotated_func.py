#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and three strings a, b, and c.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` by changing any character in `a` to the corresponding character in `c`. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the loop variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` are no longer in scope.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` by changing any character in `a` to the corresponding character in `c`. If such a transformation is possible for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer in scope.
