Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` by changing any character in `a` to the corresponding character in `c`. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the loop variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` are no longer in scope.**
