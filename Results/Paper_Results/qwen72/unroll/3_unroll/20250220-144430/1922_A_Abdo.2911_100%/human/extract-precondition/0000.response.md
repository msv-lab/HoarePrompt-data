Precondition: **The function should take four parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and three strings a, b, and c.**
