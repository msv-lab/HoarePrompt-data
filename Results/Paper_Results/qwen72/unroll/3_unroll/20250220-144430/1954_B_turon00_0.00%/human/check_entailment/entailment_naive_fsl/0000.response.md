Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful in certain scenarios.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the `2`s will make the array stop being beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it only checks the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array (`1` in this case). It does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not equal to the first element but are still part of the pattern that makes the array beautiful.

The program's logic is flawed because it assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove to stop the array from being beautiful is always related to the first element. This is not always the case, as shown in the example above. The correct approach should consider all possible elements and their counts, and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern that makes the array beautiful.
