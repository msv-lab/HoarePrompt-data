Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the array `a` consists of only one unique element by converting it to a set `aa` and checking its length.
   - If `len(aa) == 1`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` using `cnt`.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Consecutive Elements Check**:
  - The program only counts consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`, which is the first element of the array. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The array might have other patterns that need to be considered.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only count the consecutive `1`s, but it should also consider the `2`s and other patterns.

- **Minimum Removal Calculation**:
  - The program updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, but this does not correctly account for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.
  - The correct approach would be to find the longest subarray where the elements can be made the same and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
