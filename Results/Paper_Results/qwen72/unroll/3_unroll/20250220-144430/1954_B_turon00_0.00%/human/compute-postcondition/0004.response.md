Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The function prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it non-beautiful, where a beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by performing a specified operation. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the function prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` will hold the state of the last test case processed. **
