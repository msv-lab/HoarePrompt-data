You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it is possible to make all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function should return the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop iterates `t` times), and the variables `n` and `a` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `tmp` will hold the first element of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `aa` will be a set containing the unique elements of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `cnt` will be 0, and the variable `ans` will hold the minimum number of elements to remove to make the last test case's array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The function prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it non-beautiful, where a beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by performing a specified operation. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the function prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` will hold the state of the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**: The problem states that the given array is already beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array where all elements are the same by repeatedly applying the operation. The key insight is that if the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program correctly outputs `-1` in such cases.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does this by:
   - Initializing `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - Using a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
   - Iterating through the array and counting consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - If a different element is found, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`) with the current count of consecutive `tmp` elements.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive `tmp` elements.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It should consider all unique elements in the array, not just the first one.

To fix this, the program should:
- Iterate through all unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, count the maximum number of consecutive occurrences.
- The minimum number of elements to remove would be the maximum of these counts.

Given this, the current program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case of finding the minimum removals for all unique elements in the array.

Correctness: **False**
