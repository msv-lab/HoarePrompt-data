Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 200,000). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns the results of the queries for each test case.**
