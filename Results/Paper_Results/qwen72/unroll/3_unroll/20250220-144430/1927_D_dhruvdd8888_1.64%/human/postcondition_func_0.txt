The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 200,000). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function processes the array to identify contiguous ranges of repeated elements and stores these ranges in a list `arr`. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of the next or previous range of repeated elements relative to the given range `[l, r]`. If no such range exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
