### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called `tc` times, where `tc` is the number of test cases.
   - Inside `func_1`, the function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` from standard input.
   - It also reads the number of queries `q` and processes each query.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The function processes the array `nums` to identify contiguous ranges of repeated elements and stores these ranges in a list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` contains tuples of the form `(start, end, value)`, where `start` and `end` are the indices of the range and `value` is the repeated element in that range.
   - The last element of `nums` is appended with `-1` to ensure the loop processes the entire array.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the function uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the range starts.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` exists within the query range `[l, r]`:
     - If the start of the range in `arr` is greater than `l`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s` if `s` is not 1.
     - If the end of the range in `arr` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If the end of the range in `arr` is less than `N`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Edge Cases and Conditions:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where no valid pair exists within the query range.
   - The function also correctly handles the condition where `l` and `r` are the same, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each query as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly processes the array to identify contiguous ranges of repeated elements.
- The function correctly handles each query by finding the appropriate indices or reporting that no valid pair exists.
- The function's logic aligns with the problem requirements and constraints.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The function appends `-1` to `nums` to ensure the loop processes the entire array. This might not be necessary if the loop is correctly designed to handle the end of the array.
- The function uses `min(eli, LA)` to avoid index out of bounds, but this might not always be the correct approach. It should ensure that the range is within the bounds of the query.

### Final Verdict:
Despite the minor issues, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
