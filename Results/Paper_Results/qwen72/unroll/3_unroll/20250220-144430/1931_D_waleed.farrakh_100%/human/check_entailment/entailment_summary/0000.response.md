### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it into a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr`.
   - The input is split into lines, and the first line is read to determine the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the function reads the next two lines to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` and appends them to the `test_cases` list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - `func_1` processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `arr`.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - `func_1` uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

4. **Output**:
   - `func_2` prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly identifies the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - The use of remainders `rx` and `ry` ensures that the conditions are met. Specifically, `rx` is used to check the divisibility of \(a_i + a_j\) by `x`, and `ry` is used to check the divisibility of \(a_i - a_j\) by `y`.
  - The dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count the number of pairs that meet the conditions.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes it into the required format for `func_1`.
  - It handles the input in a way that is consistent with the problem description, ensuring that each test case is processed correctly.
  - The results are printed in the correct format, one per line.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly to solve the problem as described. The input is processed correctly, and the pairs are counted based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
