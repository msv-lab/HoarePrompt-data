Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function correctly iterates over each test case and initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.
   - It appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function reads the input from standard input and processes it to extract the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - It correctly constructs the list of test cases and calls `func_1` with this list.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the conditions for a pair of indices to be beautiful:
- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) if and only if \((-a_i) \% x\) and \(a_j \% x\) have the same remainder.
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) if and only if \(a_i \% y\) and \(a_j \% y\) have the same remainder.

The use of the frequency dictionary `freq` ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of such pairs without needing to check every possible pair explicitly, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays.

The input processing in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's input format. It reads the input, splits it into lines, and processes each test case appropriately.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program handles all valid inputs correctly and produces the expected output.

Final: **True**
