### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the function correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of test cases and processes each one.
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - This part of the function correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs as described in the problem.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases using `func_1`, `func_2` prints the results.
   - The results are printed one per line, which matches the output format specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs, and prints the results in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
