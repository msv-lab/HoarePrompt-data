Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry` as the remainders when `-a` is divided by `x` and `a` is divided by `y`, respectively.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it.
   - It splits the input into lines and extracts the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the first line and the array `arr` from the second line.
   - It appends the test case data to the `test_cases` list.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions, and `func_2` correctly reads and processes the input. The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
