The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of integers `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs in the respective `arr` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The original `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
