To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is an iterable that contains at least one element. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`results` must be an iterable**: Since `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, it must be an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or generator) for the loop to execute.
2. **`results` must contain at least one element**: If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `results` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

We need to ensure that `results` is not empty. This means that `func_1(test_cases)` must return an iterable with at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is an iterable returned by `func_1(test_cases)` and must contain at least one element, `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state**.
