Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the second, third, and fourth values of each pair of lines in `data`, starting from the second line. `arr` is a list of integers derived from the third line of each pair of lines in `data`. `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state, and `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
