### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and populates the `test_cases` list as expected.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count`.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - This logic correctly identifies pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases, `func_2` calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list.
   - It then prints each result in the `results` list.
   - This part of the code correctly outputs the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the test cases to find the number of beautiful pairs, and outputs the results. The logic in both functions is sound and aligns with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
