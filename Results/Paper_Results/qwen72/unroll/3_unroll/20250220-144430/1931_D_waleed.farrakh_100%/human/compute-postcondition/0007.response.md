Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the second, third, and fourth values of each pair of lines in `data`, starting from the second line. `arr` is a list of integers derived from the third line of each pair of lines in `data`. `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, and `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state.
