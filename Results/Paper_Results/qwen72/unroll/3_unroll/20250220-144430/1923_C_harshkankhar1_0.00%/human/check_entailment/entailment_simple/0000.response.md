### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, but it does not handle multiple test cases properly. It calls `func_1()` in a loop, but `func_1` itself does not take any parameters, and it reads input directly within the function. This is a potential issue, but for the sake of this problem, we can assume that the input is handled correctly for a single test case.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with a leading zero and then populated with the input values. This is correct as it allows for easier computation of cumulative sums.
   - The array `b` is initialized with zeros and then populated with cumulative sums of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. This is a clever approach to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and that all elements in `b` are positive.

3. **Cumulative Sums:**
   - The program correctly computes the cumulative sums of `a` using `itertools.accumulate`.
   - The cumulative sums of `b` are also correctly computed within the loop.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]` or if `l_i == r_i`.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray `a` is not less than the sum of the subarray `b`, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good."
   - The condition `x == y` checks if the subarray is a single element, which cannot be "good" because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with the same sum and all elements positive.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions mentioned above, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The use of cumulative sums and the conditions for checking the queries are appropriate and align with the problem requirements.
