Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) representing the borders of the subarray (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` and `q` are now assigned the values from the input. `a` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, followed by the integers entered by the user. `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
