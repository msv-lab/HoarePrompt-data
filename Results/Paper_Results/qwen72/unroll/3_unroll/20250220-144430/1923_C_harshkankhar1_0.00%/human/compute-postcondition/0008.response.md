Output State: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` also remain unchanged. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is true, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed for each query.
