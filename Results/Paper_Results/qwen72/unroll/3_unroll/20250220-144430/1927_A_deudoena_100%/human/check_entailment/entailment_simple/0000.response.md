Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in a strip white. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1()` does not take any parameters, but according to the problem description, it should take the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip. This is a significant issue because the function cannot operate correctly without these inputs.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads input directly using `input()`, which is not ideal when the function is supposed to be called multiple times in a loop. Each call to `func_1()` should handle the input for a single test case, but the function should not be responsible for reading the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Segment**:
   - The variable `c` is used to find the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.
   - The variable `d` is used to find the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.
   - The function then returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is intended to be the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive. However, the formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. It should be `ma - mi + 1` to correctly calculate the length of the segment.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` contains only one 'B', the function should return 1, but the current implementation might return 2 due to the incorrect formula.
   - If the string `s` contains no 'B' (which is not possible according to the problem constraints), the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
