The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must be non-empty. The variable `j` will take the value of the first character in the string `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`c` is 0, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must be non-empty, `t` is an input integer, the list of tuples is an input list, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character in `s`**
