Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over them, calling `func_1()` for each test case and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. Inside this function:
   - It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `c` and `d` to 0, which will be used to find the positions of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It initializes an empty list `l`, but this list is not used in the function, so it can be considered redundant. This part is correct.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
   - It increments `c` for each cell and checks if the cell is 'B'.
   - When it finds the first 'B', it sets `mi` to `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `mi` will now hold the position of the first black cell. This part is correct.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
   - It increments `d` for each cell and checks if the cell is 'B'.
   - When it finds the last 'B', it sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `ma` will now hold the position of the last black cell. This part is correct.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program returns `ma - mi + 2` as the result.
   - This formula is intended to calculate the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
   - However, the correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to correctly calculate the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
   - The current formula adds an extra 1, which is incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the strip consists of only one black cell, both `mi` and `ma` will be the same, and the formula `ma - mi + 2` will return 2, which is incorrect. The correct result should be 1.
   - If the strip has no black cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

7. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` should be `ma - mi + 1` to correctly calculate the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
   - The current formula adds an extra 1, which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it adds an extra 1 in the formula to calculate the segment length.

Final: **False**
