Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and the arrays `p` and `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The function initializes two lists, `pathb` and `paths`, to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.
   - For Bodya, it starts at position `P_B` and follows the permutation `p` to collect scores from `a` until it encounters a previously visited position. This ensures that it doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts at position `P_S` and follows the permutation `p` to collect scores from `a` until it encounters a previously visited position.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to calculate the score for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The score for each turn is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for Bodya and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for Sasha, where `preb` and `pres` are the cumulative scores up to the current turn.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, the function compares `resb` (Bodya's score) and `ress` (Sasha's score).
   - It prints 'Bodya' if `resb` is greater, 'Sasha' if `ress` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is less than the number of turns, breaking the loop early to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - The function correctly initializes and resets the necessary variables for each test case, ensuring that the results for each test case are independent.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the permutation `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" problem and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
