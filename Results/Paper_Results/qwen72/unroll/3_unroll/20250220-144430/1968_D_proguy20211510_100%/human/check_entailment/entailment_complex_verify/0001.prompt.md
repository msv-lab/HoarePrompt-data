You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `MOD`, and `alpha` remain unchanged. The variables `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are reset and recalculated for each test case. After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are undefined as they are reinitialized and used within each test case loop. The loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case based on the calculated values of `resb` and `ress`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of elements in two different paths starting from `P_B` and `P_S` in the permutation `p`, considering the array `a` and the limit `k`. The function then compares these sums and prints 'Bodya' if the sum from `P_B` is greater, 'Sasha' if the sum from `P_S` is greater, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function does not return any values; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres`, as they are reinitialized for each test case. The input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It converts the input strings to integers and initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a while loop to detect cycles for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - It appends the scores at each position to the `pathb` and `paths` lists.
   - It marks visited positions using the `vis` list to avoid infinite loops.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by iterating through their respective paths.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to keep track of the cumulative score and multiplies the current score by the remaining number of turns `(k - i)` to account for the possibility of staying at the same position.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Length Handling:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle the length of the cycle. If the cycle length is greater than `k`, it should stop the loop early to avoid unnecessary calculations.
  - However, the program does break the loop if `k < i + 1`, which is a correct approach to handle this case.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it could be optimized to avoid recalculating the same sums multiple times.

- **Variable Naming:**
  - The variable names `YES` and `NO` are defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

- **Unrelated Variables:**
  - The variable `alpha` is defined but not used in the program, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the permutation game as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison correctly. The only issues are some unnecessary variables and potential optimization, but these do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
