t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, P_B and P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, p is a permutation of length n containing integers from 1 to n, a is an array of length n containing positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
