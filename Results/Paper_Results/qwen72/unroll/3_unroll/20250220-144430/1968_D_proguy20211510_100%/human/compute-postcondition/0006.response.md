Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of elements in two different paths starting from `P_B` and `P_S` in the permutation `p`, considering the array `a` and the limit `k`. The function then compares these sums and prints 'Bodya' if the sum from `P_B` is greater, 'Sasha' if the sum from `P_S` is greater, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function does not return any values; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres`, as they are reinitialized for each test case. The input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. **
