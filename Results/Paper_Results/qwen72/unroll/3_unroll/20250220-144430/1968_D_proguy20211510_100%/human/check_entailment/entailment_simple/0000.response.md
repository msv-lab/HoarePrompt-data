### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the path for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` starting from their respective positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops. This is crucial because the permutation can have cycles.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to calculate the score for each turn, considering the possibility of staying or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The score is updated using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for Bodya and `curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for Sasha, where `preb` and `pres` are the prefix sums of scores.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the function compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The function correctly handles cycles by using the `vis` list to break the loop when a position is revisited. This ensures that the path calculation does not get stuck in an infinite loop.
  
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation logic seems to be correct. It considers the score at each position and the number of remaining turns to maximize the score.
  - However, the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` might not be the most intuitive way to calculate the score. It should be noted that this formula is used to calculate the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is very large or when the permutation has cycles. The cycle detection ensures that the score calculation is done correctly even in these cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the score calculation and comparison are done correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
