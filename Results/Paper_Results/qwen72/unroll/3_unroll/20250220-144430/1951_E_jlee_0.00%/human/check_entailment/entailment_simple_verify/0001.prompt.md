You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. The loop processes each string in `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified, and may also print additional information if 'YES' is printed. The internal variables `string`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` are reset or modified during each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Single Character String**: If the string `s` has only one character (`n == 1`), the program correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check**: The program checks if the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`). If they are, the string is not a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

4. **All Characters the Same**: The program checks if all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`). If they are, the string is a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "NO" because it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same**: The program checks if all but one character in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`). If this is the case, it further checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different from `x`. If the middle character is different, the program prints "NO" because the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

6. **General Case**: For strings that do not fall into the above categories, the program iterates through the first half of the string and checks for the first position where the characters at the beginning and the end of the string are different (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`). If such a position is found, the program prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

7. **Handling Complex Cases**: If the characters at the beginning and end are the same but the string is not a simple palindrome, the program attempts to find a valid partition by tracking the positions of characters that are different from `x` (`count` and `count2`). If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" with the partition. If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Single Character String**: The program correctly handles this case.
- **First and Last Character Check**: The program correctly handles this case.
- **All Characters the Same**: The program correctly handles this case.
- **Almost All Characters the Same**: The program correctly handles this case.
- **General Case**: The program attempts to find a valid partition, but the logic for finding the partition is overly complex and may not always produce the correct result. For example, the program might miss valid partitions in some cases.

### Example of a Potential Issue:

Consider the string `abba`. The program will:
- Set `x` to `a`.
- Check if `a` is different from `a` (first and last characters are the same).
- Check if all characters are `a` (they are not).
- Check if all but one character is `a` (they are not).
- Iterate through the string and find that `s[1]` and `s[2]` are different from `s[0]` and `s[3]`.

However, the program will not correctly identify the partition `ab b a` as a valid non-palindromic partition.

### Conclusion:

The program is not correct for all cases. It fails to handle some complex cases where a valid partition exists but is not identified.

### Correctness:
**False**
