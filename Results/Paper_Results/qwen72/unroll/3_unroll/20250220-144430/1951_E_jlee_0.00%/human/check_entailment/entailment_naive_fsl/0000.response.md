Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string has more than two distinct characters and can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, consider the string "abccbaab". The program will incorrectly output "NO" for this string, even though it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings such as "abc" and "cbaab" or "abcc" and "baab". The logic in the program is too restrictive and does not explore all possible partitions to ensure that a non-palindromic partition exists.
