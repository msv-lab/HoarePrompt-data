Output State: **The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"). The input has been read, and `trump` is now assigned the value of the input character. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list.**
