You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: The values of x and y remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop processes inputs n and m, and for each iteration, it prints a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop does not alter the initial state of x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the user, computes the absolute difference `k` between them, and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`; if `k` is odd, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` after subtracting all smaller powers of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables or the initial state of the program.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sequences \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \).
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these sequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are derived by XORing the index \( n \) with two distinct constants \( x \) and \( y \).
   - The difference between \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) is \( (n \oplus x) \oplus (n \oplus y) = x \oplus y \). This means that the sequences will differ by a constant value \( k = x \oplus y \).

3. **Behavior of XOR:**
   - XOR is a bitwise operation that results in a 1 in each bit position where the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1s, and a 0 where they are the same.
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, then the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will have a common subsegment of length \( k \). This is because the XOR operation will flip a single bit, and the sequences will align in a periodic manner with a period of \( k \).

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: \( k \) is a power of 2.**
     - If \( k \) is a power of 2, the length of the longest common subsegment is \( k \). This is because the sequences will repeat every \( k \) elements.
   - **Case 2: \( k \) is odd.**
     - If \( k \) is odd, the sequences will not have a common subsegment longer than 1. This is because the XOR of an odd number with any integer \( n \) will result in a sequence that does not align in a periodic manner.
   - **Case 3: \( k \) is even but not a power of 2.**
     - If \( k \) is even but not a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides \( k \). This is because the sequences will align in a periodic manner with a period equal to the largest power of 2 that divides \( k \).

5. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It computes \( k = |x - y| \).
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \( k \) is even but not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 that divides \( k \) until \( k \) becomes a power of 2, and then prints the result.

6. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly handles the three cases mentioned above.
   - The use of `bin(k).replace('0b', '')` to convert \( k \) to its binary representation and then finding the length of the binary string to determine the largest power of 2 is a valid approach.
   - The loop that repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 from \( k \) ensures that \( k \) is reduced to the largest power of 2 that divides it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) based on the value of \( k = x \oplus y \).

Correctness: **True**
