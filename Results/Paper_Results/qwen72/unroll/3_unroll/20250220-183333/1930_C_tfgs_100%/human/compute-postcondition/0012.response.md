The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state before the loop (such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `counter`, `cur`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
