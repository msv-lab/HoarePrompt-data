Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that after each operation, the element `a_i` is deleted from the array `a`, and the indices of all elements to the right of `a_i` will decrease by 1. However, the provided program does not perform this deletion and index adjustment. Instead, it modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then sorts the set of these modified elements. This approach does not follow the specified three-step operation and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i=3` (last element), insert `8 + 3 = 11` into `S`, and delete `8` from `a`. Now `a = [6, 4]` and `S = {11}`.
2. Select `i=2` (last element of the new `a`), insert `4 + 2 = 6` into `S`, and delete `4` from `a`. Now `a = [6]` and `S = {11, 6}`.
3. Select `i=1` (last element of the new `a`), insert `6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, and delete `6` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {11, 7, 6}`.

The sorted set `S` in decreasing order is `[11, 7, 6]`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
11 7 6
```
which is correct in this case, but it does not follow the correct logic for all cases. For instance, if the input is:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i=3` (last element), insert `3 + 3 = 6` into `S`, and delete `3` from `a`. Now `a = [1, 2]` and `S = {6}`.
2. Select `i=2` (last element of the new `a`), insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`, and delete `2` from `a`. Now `a = [1]` and `S = {6, 4}`.
3. Select `i=1` (last element of the new `a`), insert `1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and delete `1` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {6, 4, 2}`.

The sorted set `S` in decreasing order is `[6, 4, 2]`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
6 4 3
```
which is incorrect because `3` should not be in the set `S` after the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
