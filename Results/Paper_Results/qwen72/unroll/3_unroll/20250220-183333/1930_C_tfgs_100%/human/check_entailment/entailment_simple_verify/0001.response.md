### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the index of the element. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements in descending order. This step is correct as it ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans` while also handling the insertion of additional elements to make the array `b` lexicographically largest.
   - The `cur` variable keeps track of the number of elements that need to be inserted between the current and previous elements.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the remaining elements that need to be added to `ans` to reach the total length `n`.

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly handles duplicates by decrementing the count of each element in the `counter` and adjusting the `cur` and `cnt` variables accordingly.

6. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order to ensure the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

- **Modification of Array `a`:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n): a[i] += i + 1` correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it. This step is crucial as it simulates the insertion of `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

- **Counting and Sorting:**
  - `counter = Counter(a)` correctly counts the occurrences of each modified element.
  - `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicates and converts `a` to a list of unique elements.
  - `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the unique elements in descending order.

- **Constructing the Array `b`:**
  - The loop `for i in range(len(a))` iterates through the sorted unique elements.
  - The condition `if i > 0:` ensures that the program only attempts to fill gaps between elements if there is a previous element.
  - `adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` calculates the number of elements to insert between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` to maximize the lexicographical order.
  - The inner loop `for j in range(adv): ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the calculated elements.
  - `cnt -= adv` and `cur -= adv` update the remaining elements to be added and the current gap count.
  - `ans.append(a[i])` appends the current unique element to `ans`.
  - `counter[a[i]] -= 1` and `cur += counter[a[i]]` handle the decrement of the count of the current element and update the current gap count.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - The loop `for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order to ensure the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the array `b` is constructed to be lexicographically largest. The logic and steps are sound and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.
