To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute if `n_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration. The state of `func` and the input handling are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
