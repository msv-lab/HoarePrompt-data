Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, followed by `t` integers `n`. For each integer `n`, it prints either `1` if `n` is `1`, or the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` if `n` is greater than `1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input has been processed and the results have been printed to the standard output. **
