#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function should be able to read input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t lines, each containing one integer n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `n_cases` times, and for each test case, it will have printed either `1` if `n` is `1`, or `2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, followed by `t` integers `n`. For each integer `n`, it prints either `1` if `n` is `1`, or the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` if `n` is greater than `1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input has been processed and the results have been printed to the standard output.
