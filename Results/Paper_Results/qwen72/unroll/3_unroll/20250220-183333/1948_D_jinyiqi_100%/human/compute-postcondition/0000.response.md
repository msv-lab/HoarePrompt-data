Output State: **The function should take two parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of testcases, and a list of strings s (each string s has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000 and consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks). The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000. `s` is now a list of characters from the input string.**
