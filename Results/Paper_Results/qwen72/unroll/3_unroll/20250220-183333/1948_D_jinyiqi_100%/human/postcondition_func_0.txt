The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a string from the user input, processes it to find the longest substring that is repeated at a distance of its length within the string, and prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2. If no such substring is found, it prints 0. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
