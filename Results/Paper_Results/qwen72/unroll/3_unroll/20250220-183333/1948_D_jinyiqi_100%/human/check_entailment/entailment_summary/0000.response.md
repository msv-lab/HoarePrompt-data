Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. The function `func_1()` reads a string, processes it to find the longest possible tandem repeat after replacing question marks, and prints the result.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the string directly from input, which is not ideal. It would be better to pass the string as a parameter to `func_1()` to make the function more modular and testable.

2. **Logic for Finding Tandem Repeats**: The logic for finding the longest tandem repeat is flawed. The current implementation checks for a substring of length `j` that can be repeated, but it does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Specifically, it only increments the `count` when the characters are either a question mark or match, and it resets the `count` when they don't match. This approach does not ensure that the longest possible tandem repeat is found, especially when there are multiple question marks that could be replaced to form a valid tandem repeat.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the string is very short (e.g., "a?"), the program might not correctly identify that a tandem repeat of length 2 is possible.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
