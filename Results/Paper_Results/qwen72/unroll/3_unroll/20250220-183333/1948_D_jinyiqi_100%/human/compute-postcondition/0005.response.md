The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `s` is a list of strings, where each string has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000 and consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

Output:
- Case_1: If the input is valid (i.e., `t` is within the specified range and `s` meets the string constraints), the function processes each string in the list and returns a list of results.
- Case_2: If the input is invalid, the function returns an error message indicating the problem with the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`. It processes each string in the list and returns a list of results. If the input is invalid, it returns an error message.**
