#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of testcases, and a list of strings s (each string s has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000 and consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks). The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop will either print a value and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything and return. The variables `j` and `count` will be in their final states after the loop completes, but the values of `t`, `s`, and `n` will remain unchanged.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a string from the user input, processes it to find the longest substring that is repeated at a distance of its length within the string, and prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2. If no such substring is found, it prints 0. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
