### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Handling Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone, so `a` introverts will require `a` tents.

3. **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means that the total number of extroverts must be a multiple of 3, or there must be enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - The function checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.
   - If the condition is false, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by dividing `(b + c)` by 3 and adding the result to `a`.

4. **Incrementing Tents for Remaining Participants:**
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are some remaining participants who need to be accommodated. The function increments `k` by 1 to account for these remaining participants.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of tents `k` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` checks if it is impossible to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts and universals. If `b` is not divisible by 3 and there are fewer than 3 universals, and the total number of extroverts and universals is not divisible by 3, then it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.
- The condition `else` handles the cases where it is possible to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts and universals. The number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is calculated as `(b + c) // 3`, and if there are any remaining participants, an additional tent is added.

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Explanation: 4 extroverts require 4/3 = 1.33 tents, which means 2 tents are needed to accommodate 4 extroverts. However, there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete group of 3 for the remaining extrovert.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Explanation: 1 extrovert requires 1/3 = 0.33 tents, which means 1 tent is needed to accommodate the extrovert. However, there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete group of 3 for the extrovert.
- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 3 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals.
- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `19 7 18`
  - Output: `28`
  - Explanation: 19 tents for the introverts, 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 7 + 18 = 25 participants, which requires 25 // 3 = 8 tents, and 25 % 3 = 1 remaining participant, so 1 additional tent is needed.
- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No participants, so no tents are needed.
- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `7 0 0`
  - Output: `7`
  - Explanation: 7 introverts require 7 tents.
- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `0 24 0`
  - Output: `8`
  - Explanation: 24 extroverts require 24 // 3 = 8 tents.
- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Output: `1666666667`
  - Explanation: 1000000000 introverts require 1000000000 tents, 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 2000000000 participants, which requires 2000000000 // 3 = 666666666 tents, and 2000000000 % 3 = 2 remaining participants, so 1 additional tent is needed.
