The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. Since the output is not specified, it is not clear what the function returns. However, for the sake of this task, I will assume that the function returns some value based on these inputs, but without specific information, I cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
