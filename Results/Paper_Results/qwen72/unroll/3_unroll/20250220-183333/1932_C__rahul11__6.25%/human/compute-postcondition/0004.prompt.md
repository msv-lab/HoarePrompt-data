You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        
        c = 1
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case and prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `MOD`, and the test cases themselves remain unchanged. The variables `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are reset and recalculated for each new test case. For each test case, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[0]` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`, and subsequent elements in `res` are the product of the remaining elements in `arr` after removing elements from the left or right based on the characters in `s`, all modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
