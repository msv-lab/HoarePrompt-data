The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
