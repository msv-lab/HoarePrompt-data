You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all test cases. For each test case, the output is the smallest index j such that cntl[j] < 2, or 0 if cntl[0] is not zero. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by the loop and retain their initial values. The list `cntl` is updated to reflect the count of each integer in the list `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and outputs the smallest index `j` such that the count of `j` is less than 2, or 0 if the count of 0 is zero. After processing all test cases, the function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. The list `cntl` is used internally to store the counts and is reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the final MEX score is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX score can be determined by counting the occurrences of each number and then adjusting a counter `c` based on these counts. This approach does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
- Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively.
- Alice can start by picking `2`, so `c` becomes `[2]` and `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
- Bob can then pick `0`, so `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, so `c` becomes `[2, 1]` and `a` becomes `[2, 3]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, so `a` becomes `[3]`.
- Alice can pick `3`, so `c` becomes `[2, 1, 3]` and `a` becomes `[]`.

At the end, `c` is `[2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4` because `0` and `1` are in `c`, but `4` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

The program, however, outputs `2` because it incorrectly handles the logic for determining the MEX score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
