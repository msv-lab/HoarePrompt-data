The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and outputs the smallest index `j` such that the count of `j` is less than 2, or 0 if the count of 0 is zero. After processing all test cases, the function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. The list `cntl` is used internally to store the counts and is reset for each test case.
