Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The logic for determining the MEX score is flawed. Specifically, the variable `c` is used to track the number of moves Alice can make to maximize the MEX, but the way it is updated and checked does not accurately reflect the optimal play for both Alice and Bob.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                mex = j
                break
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            print(mex)
        else:
            print(mex + 1 if cntl[mex] == 1 else mex)

```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Elements**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using the list `cntl`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The program then iterates through the counts to find the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`. This is the MEX if both players play optimally.
3. **Optimal Play**:
   - If `n` is even, Bob will always have the last move, and the MEX will be the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, Alice will have the last move. If `cntl[mex] == 1`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is `mex + 1` by picking the element `mex` on her last turn. Otherwise, the MEX remains `mex`.

This corrected version ensures that the game's final score is determined correctly based on the optimal strategies of both players.
