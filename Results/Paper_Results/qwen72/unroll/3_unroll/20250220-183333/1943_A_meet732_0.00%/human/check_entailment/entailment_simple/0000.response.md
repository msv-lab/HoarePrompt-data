### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` and increments the count of each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, the MEX is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `a`.
   - This check is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, the MEX must be 0.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most 2 zeros to maximize the MEX.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` and checks if `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If it is, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is zero or if `j` is the last integer in the range.
   - If `c` is zero or `j` is the last integer, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the MEX for each test case based on the optimal play strategy of Alice and Bob.

### Analysis of the Strategy:
- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to pick the smallest integers that are not already in `c` and are not picked by Bob.
  - If there are at least two zeros, Alice can pick both zeros to ensure that 0 is in `c` and the MEX is at least 1.
- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to pick the smallest integers that are not already in `c` and are not picked by Alice.
  - If there are fewer than two zeros, Bob will pick the remaining zero to ensure that 0 is not in `c` and the MEX is 0.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial check for MEX.
- The loop for finding the MEX is logically sound and follows the optimal play strategy.
- The program ensures that the MEX is the smallest integer that is not in `c` after both players have played optimally.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
