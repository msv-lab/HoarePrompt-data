The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
