Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The result is determined as follows: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`; if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`; otherwise, it prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n). After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained. **
