### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and processes it.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function immediately prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition, as the string is already non-palindromic.

3. **Uniform Character Check:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings:
     - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different (`s[(n - 1) // 2] != x`), it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

4. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of the string to find the first pair of characters that are different (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it uses additional logic to check if the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings:
     - It keeps track of the first position where a character different from `x` is found (`count`).
     - It also keeps track of the number of times a character different from `x` appears (`count2`).
     - Based on these counts, it prints "YES" with the appropriate partition if possible.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the string is already non-palindromic.
- The logic for finding a partition into two non-palindromic substrings is complex but seems to cover most cases. However, it might be overly complicated and could be simplified.

### Simplification:
- The function can be simplified by focusing on the key points:
  - If the string is already non-palindromic, print "YES" with the entire string.
  - If the string has all identical characters, print "NO".
  - If the string has a single different character, check if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Correctness:
- The function appears to correctly handle all the given cases and constraints.
- However, the logic for partitioning into two non-palindromic substrings can be simplified for clarity and efficiency.

### Conclusion:
- Despite the complexity, the function appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
