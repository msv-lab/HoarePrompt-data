Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, consider the input string "abba". This string is a palindrome, but it can be partitioned into "a" and "bba" or "abb" and "a", where neither of the substrings is a palindrome. The program will incorrectly output "NO" for this case.
