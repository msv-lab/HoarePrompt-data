### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`. It is a simple comparison function and is correct for its intended purpose.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The function then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
     - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to update `x` by subtracting the number of 1x1 cells that can be occupied by the 2x2 icons and then adding the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the remaining cells on each screen after placing a 2x2 icon are `15 - 4 = 11`.
     - `bxsfory1` is then calculated as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This is also incorrect. The correct formula should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` to determine the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is the number of screens needed to place all 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `0`, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - The function is correct for its intended purpose.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the errors in the formula used in `func_2` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11`, and the formula for `bxsfory1` should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` instead of `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
