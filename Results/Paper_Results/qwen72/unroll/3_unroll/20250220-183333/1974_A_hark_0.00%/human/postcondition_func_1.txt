The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from user input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99. It then prints a value based on the following conditions: If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of the ceiling of `y / 2` and a calculated value based on the updated `x`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.
