Output State: **The `trumps` list is now sorted in ascending order by rank. The `suits` dictionary and `answers` list remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The `trumps` list is sorted in ascending order by rank.
- The `suits` dictionary will still have `None` for all suits that had a trump card played, and the last non-trump card rank for any suit that did not have a trump card played.
- The `answers` list will still contain strings representing pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) for each suit where two non-trump cards were played, formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit".
- If there are more non-trump suits than trump ranks, the loop will still print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and terminate.
