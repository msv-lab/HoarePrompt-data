Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the `trump_suit`. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a trump card played, and the last non-trump card rank for any suit that did not have a trump card played. The `answers` list will contain strings representing pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) for each suit where two non-trump cards were played, formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit".**
