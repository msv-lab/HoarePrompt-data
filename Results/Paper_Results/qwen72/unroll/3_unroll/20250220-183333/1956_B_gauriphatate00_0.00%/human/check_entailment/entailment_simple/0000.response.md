### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You and Nene are playing a game with 2n cards, each card having an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on your cards).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should play a card that has a pair in your hand as soon as possible, because Nene will play optimally to score points.
   - Nene will always play a card that has a pair on the table if possible, to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is the number of pairs you have, but you can only score up to `n // 2` points because you have `n` turns and each pair can only be scored once.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `t` (the number of test cases) and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `a`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read in bulk and split into a list of strings.
   - The function processes each test case by reading the appropriate values from the list.
   - The output is printed for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The input and output handling is also correct and matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
