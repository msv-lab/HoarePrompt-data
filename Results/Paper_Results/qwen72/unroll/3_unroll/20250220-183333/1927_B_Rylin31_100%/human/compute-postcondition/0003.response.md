Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing a trace. For each test case, the function constructs a string by mapping each integer in the trace to a character based on its position in the alphabet (starting from 'a'). The function then prints the constructed string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further output is generated. **
