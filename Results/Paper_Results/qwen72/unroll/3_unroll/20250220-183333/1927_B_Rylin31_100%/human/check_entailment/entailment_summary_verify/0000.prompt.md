You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Example

    0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
    
    10
    
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
    
    1
    
    0
    
    8
    
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
    8
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output

    abracadabra
    codeforces
    a
    aaaaaaaa
    dijkstra

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing a trace. For each test case, the function constructs a string by mapping each integer in the trace to a character based on its position in the alphabet (starting from 'a'). The function then prints the constructed string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further output is generated.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the trace array contains values that are out of the range of the previously used indices. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 1 2 0 3
```

The expected output could be a string like "abaca", where the trace is correctly represented. However, the program will output "abcda", which is incorrect because the trace for "abcda" would be `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`, not `[0, 1, 2, 0, 3]`.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly manage the count of each character. It should ensure that the character assigned to a position in the string has the correct count of previous occurrences as specified by the trace array. The current implementation does not guarantee this, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
