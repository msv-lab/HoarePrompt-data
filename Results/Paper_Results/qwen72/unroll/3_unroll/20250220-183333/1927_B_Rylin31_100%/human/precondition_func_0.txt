The function `func` is expected to take input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
