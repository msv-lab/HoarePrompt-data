### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operation can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after applying the operation.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, in which case the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - The function then tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarrays.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not match the definition of MEX. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the subarray in a way that does not consider the actual MEX value.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It recursively checks different splits and compares the results to determine the optimal sequence of operations.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it calls `make_stairs` and returns the operation.
   - **Issue**: The recursion in `func_2` is not well-defined. The function `make_stairs` is called with a fixed `start_index` which is not updated in the recursive calls. This can lead to incorrect operations being recorded.
   - **Issue**: The function relies on global variables `res` and `arr`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code hard to understand and maintain.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the elements to the MEX value.
   - It appends the operation to the result list `res` and updates the array `arr`.
   - **Issue**: The function `make_stairs` does not correctly handle the transformation of the subarray. It does not update the `start_index` in recursive calls, leading to incorrect modifications of the array.
   - **Issue**: The function does not ensure that the number of operations is within the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **Additional Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is a crucial part of the problem, and the current implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX should be calculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `res` and `arr` in `func_2` and `make_stairs` can lead to side effects and make the code harder to reason about.
   - **Operation Count**: The program does not have a mechanism to ensure that the number of operations is within the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX calculation is incorrect, the recursive functions do not handle the subarray transformations properly, and the use of global variables and the lack of a clear operation count mechanism are significant issues.

Final: **False**
