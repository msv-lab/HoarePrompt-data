Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `i` is decreased by 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index, and the current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`.**

The value of `i` is decreased by 1, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The function `make_stairs` is called with the argument `i - 1`, but the specific impact of this function call on the state is not provided, so we only reflect the change in `i`.
