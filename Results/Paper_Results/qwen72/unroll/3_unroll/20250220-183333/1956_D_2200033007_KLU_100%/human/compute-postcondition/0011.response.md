Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.***
