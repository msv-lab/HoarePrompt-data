The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is a non-negative integer. The function also implicitly assumes the presence of a list `arr` and a list `res`, both of which are not passed as parameters but are used within the function. The length of `arr` is at least `start_index + i`.

Case_1: If the function returns `None`, it indicates that the function has completed its intended operation and explicitly returns `None`.

Case_2: If the function does not return any value, it means the function completes its operation without explicitly returning a value, which in Python results in an implicit `None` return.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `make_stairs` is to accept a non-negative integer `i` and perform some operation on `arr` and `res` (which are not parameters but are used within the function). Depending on the internal logic, it either returns `None` explicitly or completes without returning a value, which results in an implicit `None`.
