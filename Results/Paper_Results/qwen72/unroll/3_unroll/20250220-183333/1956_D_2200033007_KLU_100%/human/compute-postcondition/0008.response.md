Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer and is currently 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples and now contains an additional tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + 0` (i.e., just the element at `start_index`) is not equal to its index.**
