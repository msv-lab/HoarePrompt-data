Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers within the bounds of a list `arr`. It returns the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a specific calculation involving elements of `arr` and recursive calls to `func_1`. If the result for the given `start_index` and `end_index` is already cached in the dictionary `res_dict`, it returns the cached value. If `start_index` is equal to `end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index` in `arr`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value by considering the initial square of the range length and the results of recursive calls, and stores this value in `res_dict` before returning it.

Additionally, `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`, and `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and operates on a list `arr` of integers. It returns a list of tuples representing segments of the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`. If the subarray has a single element that is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If the subarray length is greater than 1 and the maximum value of a certain calculation (using `func_1`) equals the square of the subarray length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)` and additional elements from `make_stairs(length - 1)`. If the sum of the first or last element of the subarray and the result of `func_1` for the remaining subarray equals the maximum value, it returns the result of `func_2` for the modified subarray. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns an empty list.

Otherwise, all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1)` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, and a tuple `(start_index, start_index + (i - 1))` is appended to `res`, with `i` also decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies the list `arr` and the list of tuples `res`. If the elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` form a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, the function returns `None` without making any changes. Otherwise, it ensures that all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`, and appends the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `arr` is modified to form a "staircase" pattern, and `res` contains tuples representing the ranges of indices that were modified.
