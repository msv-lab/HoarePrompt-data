To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
```

Here, the loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(w // 1)` is non-empty. This means that `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **`w` must be an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`**: This is given in the state before the loop.
2. **`M` contains the integer `w`, which is the square root of `q`**: This is also given in the state before the loop.
3. **`int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1**: This is the condition for the loop to execute.

Given that `w` is the square root of `q` and `w` must be an integer, `q` must be a perfect square. Additionally, `w` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1).

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- **`w` must be an integer and `w` >= 2**: This ensures that `int(w // 1)` is greater than 1.
- **`i` is 1**: This is the starting point of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is a list containing the integer `w` which is the square root of `q`, `w` is an integer and `w` >= 2, `i` is 1**
