The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `q` and `x`, where both are integers and must satisfy the constraint 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` that contains integers which are divisors of `q` and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (with 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
