Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer value for each case.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - For each of the first two positions (0 and 1), it checks if the remaining `lex` value is less than or equal to 26. If so, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - After handling the first two positions, it appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters by converting the positions in `arr` to their respective ASCII values (using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`).

4. **Issues**:
   - The logic for determining the positions of the letters is flawed. It should always try to subtract the largest possible value from `lex` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - The program does not handle the case where `lex` is exactly 26 correctly. It should append 26 and subtract 26, not append 1 and subtract 1.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `lex` is less than 26 for the first two positions. It should append the largest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each of the three positions, the program should try to subtract the largest possible value from `lex` that is less than or equal to 26.
   - After determining the positions, it should sort the list to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

Given the issues in the decoding logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
