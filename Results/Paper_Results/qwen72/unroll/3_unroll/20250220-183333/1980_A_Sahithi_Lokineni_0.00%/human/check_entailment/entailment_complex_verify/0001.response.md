### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Problem Counting:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - This is done using the loop `for i in range(n): d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` (which are the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count of that difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If so, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level by `m - d[val]` and adds this to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

5. **Issues:**
   - The program uses `default_value` in the `defaultdict` initialization, but `default_value` is not defined. It should be `int` or `lambda: 0` to ensure that the default value is 0.
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - The condition `if d[val] <= m` is incorrect. It should be `if d[val] < m` because if the count of a difficulty level is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function should accept three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` (integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), and `a` (a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G').
  - The function `func_1` is never called and is not necessary for the program's functionality.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0.
  - It does not modify any external state or variables.
  - This function is irrelevant to the problem and can be safely removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected to use int as the default value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:  # Corrected to use < instead of <=
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Default Value for `defaultdict`:** The `defaultdict` should be initialized with `int` or `lambda: 0` to ensure that the default value for any key is 0.
- **Comparison in the Loop:** The condition `if d[val] < m` is more appropriate than `if d[val] <= m` because if the count of a difficulty level is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the undefined `default_value` and the incorrect comparison `<=`.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False** (due to the issues mentioned, but can be corrected as shown)
