### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - This approach is efficient for reading large inputs, which is important given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and each array can have up to 10^5 elements).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Sorting is necessary to determine the median, which is the middle element for odd-length arrays and the element at the higher middle index for even-length arrays.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because for an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
   - For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, which is the higher middle index.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the smallest elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
   - The heap is used to keep track of the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each time an element is incremented, the number of operations is increased by 1.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is collected in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the results are printed for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a loop and storing each test case in a list. The `test_cases` list is constructed correctly, and the function `func_1` processes each test case independently.

- **Median Calculation:**
  - The median calculation is correct for both odd and even-length arrays. The median index `median_index = n // 2` is appropriate, and the current median `current_median = arr[median_index]` is correctly identified.

- **Heap Operations:**
  - The use of a min-heap to increment the smallest elements is efficient and ensures the minimum number of operations. The heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array, which are the elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
  - The while loop continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median, ensuring that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case. The results are collected in the `results` list and printed one by one.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The state is correctly described. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` and `arr` with valid constraints.

- **Function `func_1` behavior:**
  - The function processes each test case by sorting the array, calculating the median, and using a min-heap to increment the smallest elements until the median is increased.
  - The heap is correctly initialized and managed, and the number of operations is accurately counted.

- **State after the function execution:**
  - The state is correctly described. `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of operations required to increase the median for each test case. The length of `results` is equal to `t`, and the input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, calculates the median, uses a min-heap to efficiently increment the necessary elements, and outputs the correct number of operations for each test case.

Final: **True**
