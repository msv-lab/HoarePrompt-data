Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when the array length `n` is even. According to the problem description, the median of an array with an even length is the element at index `ceil(n/2)`, which corresponds to `n // 2` in zero-based indexing. However, the program incorrectly uses the second half of the sorted array to form the heap, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median is `3` (at index `2` in zero-based indexing). The program should find the minimum number of operations to increase this median. However, the program forms a heap from the second half of the array `[3, 4]`, and it will incorrectly try to increase the smallest element in this heap, which is `3`. This will not change the median, and the program will return `1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` (increasing the second element `2` to `3` and then to `4`).

This indicates that the program does not handle the even-length array case correctly, leading to incorrect results.
