### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program sorts the array `arr` and determines the median index.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`, which is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - A min-heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is because we are interested in the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the median.

3. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `operations` to 0 and enters a loop where it continues to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted, and the updated element is pushed back into the heap.
   - The loop ensures that the smallest element in the heap is always greater than the current median, which is the desired condition to increase the median.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of the number of operations required for each test case.
   - The main block of the program prints each result from the list.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` correctly processes each test case and returns the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted array greater than the median.
- The input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, which is expected as they are only used for processing and not modified.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `arr = [2, 2, 8]`
  - Sorted array: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Median index: `1` (element `2`)
  - Operations required: `1` (increment the first `2` to `3` to make the median `3`)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `arr = [7, 3, 3, 1]`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`
  - Median index: `1` (element `3`)
  - Operations required: `2` (increment the first `3` to `4` and the second `3` to `5` to make the median `4`)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 1`, `arr = [1000000000]`
  - Sorted array: `[1000000000]`
  - Median index: `0` (element `1000000000`)
  - Operations required: `1` (increment the single element to `1000000001` to make the median `1000000001`)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5`, `arr = [5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`
  - Sorted array: `[4, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - Median index: `2` (element `5`)
  - Operations required: `3` (increment the `4` to `5`, and then two of the `5`s to `6` to make the median `6`)

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 6`, `arr = [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Median index: `2` (element `2`)
  - Operations required: `2` (increment the first `2` to `3` and the second `2` to `3` to make the median `3`)

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 2]`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
  - Median index: `1` (element `2`)
  - Operations required: `1` (increment the `1` to `2` to make the median `2`)

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 1]`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
  - Median index: `1` (element `1`)
  - Operations required: `2` (increment both `1`s to `2` to make the median `2`)

- **Test Case 8**: `n = 4`, `arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - Sorted array: `[5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - Median index: `1` (element `5`)
  - Operations required: `3` (increment three of the `5`s to `6` to make the median `6`)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The execution summary and the examples provided confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
