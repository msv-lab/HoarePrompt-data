### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Preparation:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through the input to prepare a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, arr)` containing the length of the array and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array, as the problem specifies that the median is the element at index `ceil(k/2)`, which is equivalent to `n // 2` for 0-based indexing.
   - The current median is then identified as `arr[median_index]`.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is because the median is the middle element in the sorted array, and we need to focus on increasing the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the median.
   - The program uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest element that is still less than or equal to the current median.
   - The loop continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median, incrementing the operations count each time an element is increased.

4. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the `results` list is returned and printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the median of the array.
- It uses a heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that are less than or equal to the current median.
- The logic ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

### Verification:
- The program handles the edge cases where the array length is 1 or 2 correctly.
- The heap operations are efficient and ensure that the smallest elements are incremented first, which is the optimal strategy for increasing the median with the minimum number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.
