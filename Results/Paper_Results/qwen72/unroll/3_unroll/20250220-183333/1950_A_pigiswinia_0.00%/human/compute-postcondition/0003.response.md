The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function will internally handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. The function will likely process these test cases and return a result for each test case. Since the constraints also mention that `1 <= t <= 1000`, it suggests that `t` represents the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and returns a result for each test case.**
