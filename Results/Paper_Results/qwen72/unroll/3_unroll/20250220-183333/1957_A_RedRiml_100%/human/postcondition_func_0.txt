The function `func` reads an integer `w` from the user input, and for each of the `w` test cases, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka` from the user input. It then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed, where a shape is defined as a group of three identical integers from the list `palka`. The function prints the number of such shapes for each test case. The function does not modify the original parameters `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` mentioned in the state before the function call. After the function concludes, `w` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.
