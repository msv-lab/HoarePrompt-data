The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. After processing, it prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is greater than or equal to `n`. The original values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
