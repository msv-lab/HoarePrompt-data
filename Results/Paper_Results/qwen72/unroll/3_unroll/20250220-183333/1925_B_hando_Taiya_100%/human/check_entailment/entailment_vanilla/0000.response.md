### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach:**
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when all the numbers in the set are multiples of the same number.
   - If we can find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`, then `d` will be the GCD of these sub-problems.
   - We need to check all divisors of `x` and find the largest one that can be used to create `n` sub-problems.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The code correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - It checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that all divisors are considered.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` are used to ensure that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with the given divisor.
   - The `max` function is used to update `ans` with the largest valid divisor.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (each sub-problem has difficulty 1).
   - The code handles the case where `n` is 1 (the GCD is `x` itself).
   - The code handles the case where `x` is a prime number (the GCD will be 1).

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The code is efficient as it only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the maximum GCD for the given constraints.
