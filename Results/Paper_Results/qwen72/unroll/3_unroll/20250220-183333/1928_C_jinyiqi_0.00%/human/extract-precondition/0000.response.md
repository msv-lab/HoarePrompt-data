Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, to represent Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, x):
```

Given this, the precondition should be:

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.**
