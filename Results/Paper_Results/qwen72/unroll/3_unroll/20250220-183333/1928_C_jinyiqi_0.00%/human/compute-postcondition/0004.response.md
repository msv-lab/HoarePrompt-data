The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The elements in `output1` were initially in ascending order, so after reversing, they will be in descending order. The state of `output2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors that are greater than the square root of `x` in the original order.**
