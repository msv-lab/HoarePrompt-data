The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list that combines two sublists: `output2`, which contains divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` in their original order, and `output1`, which contains divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list combining divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` in their original order and divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.**
