### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - The function correctly identifies the conditions for a string `s` to match a template `t`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Template:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - This logic is correct.
   - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - This logic is also correct.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This logic is correct.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The conditions for determining if a template exists such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not are correctly implemented.
- The function correctly identifies the positions where the template can be determined and checks if `c` matches or does not match the template based on these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
