Output State: **The function `func_1` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if there was at least one position `i` where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was different, or if `c[i]` was different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, it will have printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will no longer hold their initial values, as they are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.**
