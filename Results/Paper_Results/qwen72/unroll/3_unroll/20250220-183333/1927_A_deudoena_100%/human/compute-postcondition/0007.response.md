The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over the reversed string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. However, the initial state does not specify the length of `s`, only that it is an input string with at least one 'B'. To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `s` is not empty and that `j` is set to the last character of `s` (which is the first character when `s` is reversed).

State: **`c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string that must contain at least one character, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer between 1 and 10 and a string of that length consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character of `s`**
