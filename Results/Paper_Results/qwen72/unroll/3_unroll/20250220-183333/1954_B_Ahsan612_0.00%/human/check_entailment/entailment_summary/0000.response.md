Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by identifying the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same in the array. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements. The problem asks for the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, not the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program checks for the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`same`), but this is not the correct approach to determine if an array can stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can have elements that are not consecutive but can still be made identical through the allowed operations.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program increments `i` by 1 when it encounters a different element, which means it skips over the next element without checking if it can be part of a beautiful sequence.
   - This leads to incorrect results for arrays where the elements are not all the same but can still be made identical through the allowed operations.

3. **Output for All Identical Elements**:
   - The program correctly outputs `-1` for arrays where all elements are the same, as it is impossible to make such an array stop being beautiful.
   - However, it fails to correctly handle other cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.
- If all elements are the same, output `-1`.
- Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        minn = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)  # Removing one element can break the beautiful property
        
        # If no elements can be removed to break the beautiful property, check the entire array
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Set Check**: We first check if all elements in the array are the same using `len(set(ar)) == 1`. If they are, we print `-1` and move to the next test case.
- **Loop Through Array**: We then loop through the array from index 1 to `n-2` to find any index `i` where `ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]`. If such an index exists, removing `ar[i]` will break the beautiful property, and we set `minn` to 1.
- **Output Result**: If no such index is found, we print `-1`. Otherwise, we print `1` as the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem of making an array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. The logic for identifying the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is not applicable to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
