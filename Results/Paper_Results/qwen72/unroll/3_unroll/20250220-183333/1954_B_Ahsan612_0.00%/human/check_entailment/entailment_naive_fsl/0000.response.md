Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

This array is already not beautiful because there are no indices \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ 4) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). However, the program will still try to find a minimum number of elements to remove, which is incorrect. The correct output for this case should be 0, but the program does not handle this scenario and will output an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output 1, which is correct for this specific case. However, the logic used to find this result is not robust and may fail in other cases. For instance, consider the input:

```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

The program will output 3, which is correct, but the logic is not clear and may not handle more complex cases correctly. The program does not properly account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beautiful property in a more optimal way.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if the array is already not beautiful.
2. If the array is beautiful, find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

The current program does not meet these requirements in all potential cases.
