The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly described in the problem statement, but based on the context, it is likely that the function returns some result based on the input parameters, possibly related to the properties of the beautiful array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n`. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, likely related to the properties of the beautiful array `a`.**
