Output State: **The variable `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the list `ar` for each test case. If all elements in `ar` are different, `minn` will be 1. If the list `ar` is empty or no consecutive elements are the same, `minn` will be -1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` will retain their initial values for the next test case, and `i`, `same`, and `num` will be reset to their initial values for each new test case.**
