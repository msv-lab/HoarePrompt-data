Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity), which will be used to track the minimum number of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - It checks if the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`.
   - If they are the same, it increments `same` to count the consecutive elements.
   - If they are different, it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element, updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - It then resets `same` to 1 to start counting the next sequence of consecutive elements.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For an array with all elements the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the program correctly identifies that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful and prints `-1`.
   - For an array with alternating elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), the program correctly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) can make the array non-beautiful and prints `1`.
   - For an array with a single element (e.g., `[1]`), the program correctly identifies that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful and prints `-1`.
   - For an array with a pattern that can be broken by removing elements (e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`), the program correctly identifies that removing the first three `3`s can make the array non-beautiful and prints `3`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is sound and handles the problem description correctly.
   - It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove or outputs `-1` if it is impossible.

However, there is a subtle issue in the loop logic that needs to be addressed:

- **Loop Increment Issue**:
  - In the loop, when `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the program increments `i` by 1 and then updates `num` to `ar[i]`.
  - This means that the next element is skipped, which can lead to incorrect results if the array has consecutive different elements followed by the same element.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The program will count the first `1` and then encounter `2`, increment `i` by 1, and update `num` to `2`.
- It will then skip the next `1` and move to the next `1`, which will be counted as a new sequence.
- This will result in `minn` being 1, which is incorrect because the array can still be beautiful after removing one element.

To fix this, the loop should not increment `i` when updating `num` to `ar[i]`. Instead, it should continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Corrected Code:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

Given the corrected code, the original assessment is not entirely accurate due to the loop increment issue. However, the corrected code is correct and handles the problem description accurately.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the loop increment issue, but the corrected code is correct.)
