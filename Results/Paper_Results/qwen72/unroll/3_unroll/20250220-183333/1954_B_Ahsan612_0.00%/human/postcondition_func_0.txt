The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the list `ar`. If all elements in `ar` are different, it prints 1. If the list `ar` is empty or no consecutive elements are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` retain their values for the next test case, while `i`, `same`, and `num` are reset for each new test case.
