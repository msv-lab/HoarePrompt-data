The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, followed by an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that is guaranteed to be beautiful. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
