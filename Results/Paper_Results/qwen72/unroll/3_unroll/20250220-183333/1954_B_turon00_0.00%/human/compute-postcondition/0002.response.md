Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the integer `n` and the array `a` for each test case, and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in the array `a`. If all elements in the array `a` are the same, it prints -1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` are updated and used within the loop, but their final values after the loop are not relevant to the next test case, as they are reset for each iteration.**
