### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - **Cumulative Counts:** It maintains a list `S` where `S[i]` is a tuple `[x, y]` representing the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   - **Condition Checking:** For each possible road position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), it checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`) and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - **Optimal Position:** It keeps track of the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i)` is minimized). If multiple positions are equally close to the middle, it chooses the smaller one.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Test Case Handling:** The function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:** This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - **Cumulative Count Calculation:** The cumulative counts are correctly calculated and stored in `S`.
   - **Condition Checking:** The conditions for the road placement are correctly checked.
   - **Optimal Position Selection:** The program correctly finds the position that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program as described in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem of finding the optimal road placement in the village of Letovo. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
