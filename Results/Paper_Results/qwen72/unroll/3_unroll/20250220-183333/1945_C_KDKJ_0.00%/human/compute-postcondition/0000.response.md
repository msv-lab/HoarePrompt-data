The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution, we do not need to adjust its state. However, the input must be a valid integer, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
