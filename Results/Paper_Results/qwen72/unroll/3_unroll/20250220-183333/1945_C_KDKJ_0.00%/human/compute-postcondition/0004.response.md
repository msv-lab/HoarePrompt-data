Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. It reads an integer from the user input, and for each value in the range of this integer, it calls the function `func_1`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `func_1` has been called a number of times equal to the user-provided integer. **
