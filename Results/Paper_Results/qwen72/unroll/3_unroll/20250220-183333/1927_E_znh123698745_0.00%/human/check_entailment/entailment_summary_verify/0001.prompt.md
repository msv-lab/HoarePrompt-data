You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function generates and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` for each test case, arranged in a specific pattern: the first element is always 1, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the original array. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, n + 1))`.
   - It then initializes an `answer` list with the first element being 1.
   - The list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`, which will be used to keep track of the indices to pick from the `array`.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The program uses a loop to construct the permutation. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` (which is initially -1) from the `array` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the element at the index `a[0]` (which is initially 1) from the `array` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The key idea is to alternate between the smallest and largest available elements in the `array` to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
- By starting with 1 and alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the program ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
- The condition `(-1) ** i` effectively alternates between appending the smallest and largest elements, which helps in maintaining the required property of the k-level permutation.

### Verification:
- Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
    - The permutation is `[2, 1]`.
    - The sum of the segment of length 2 is `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - There is only one segment, so the condition is trivially satisfied.
  - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`:
    - The permutation is `[1, 3, 2]`.
    - The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`.
    - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `5 - 4 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
    - The permutation is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
    - The sums of the segments are:
      - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
      - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
      - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
      - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
      - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
      - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
      - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
    - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 23 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness:
