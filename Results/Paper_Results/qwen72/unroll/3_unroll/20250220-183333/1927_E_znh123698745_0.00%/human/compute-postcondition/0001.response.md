Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the output is a sequence of integers from 1 to n, arranged in a specific pattern where the first element is 1, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the original array. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.**
