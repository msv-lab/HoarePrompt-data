### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input. This part is accurate.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, n + 1))`. This is correct.
   - It then initializes an `answer` list with the first element being 1. This is also correct.
   - The list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`, which will be used to keep track of the indices to pick from the `array`. This is correct, but the initial value of `a[0]` should be 0 to correctly index the first element of the array.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The program uses a loop to construct the permutation. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` (which is initially -1) from the `array` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the element at the index `a[0]` (which is initially 1) from the `array` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.
   - The condition `(-1) ** i` effectively alternates between appending the smallest and largest elements, which helps in maintaining the required property of the k-level permutation. However, the initial value of `a[0]` being 1 instead of 0 means that the first element picked from the beginning of the array is actually the second element, not the first. This can cause issues in the permutation construction.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case. This part is correct.

### Verification with the Provided Example Test Cases:
- For `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
  - The permutation is `[2, 1]`.
  - The sum of the segment of length 2 is `2 + 1 = 3`.
  - There is only one segment, so the condition is trivially satisfied.
  - **Note**: The permutation should be `[1, 2]` to start with 1, but the program outputs `[2, 1]` due to the incorrect initial value of `a[0]`.

- For `n = 3` and `k = 2`:
  - The permutation is `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`.
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `5 - 4 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.
  - **Note**: The permutation should be `[1, 2, 3]` to start with 1 and correctly alternate, but the program outputs `[1, 3, 2]` due to the incorrect initial value of `a[0]`.

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
  - The permutation is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
  - The sums of the segments are:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 23 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.
  - **Note**: The permutation should start with 1 and correctly alternate, but the program outputs a permutation that does not start with 1 and does not correctly alternate due to the incorrect initial value of `a[0]`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples due to the incorrect initial value of `a[0]`. The permutation should start with 1 and correctly alternate between the smallest and largest available elements. The current implementation starts with 1 but then alternates incorrectly, leading to potential issues in the sums of continuous segments.
