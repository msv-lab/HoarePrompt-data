### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts with an initial answer list `[1]` and an auxiliary list `a` with elements `[1, -1]`.

3. **Alternating Pattern:**
   - The function then iterates from 1 to `n-1` and alternates between appending elements from the end and the beginning of the `array` to the `answer` list.
   - This is achieved by checking the parity of `i` using `(-1) ** i`. If `i` is odd, it appends the last element of `array` and decrements the index. If `i` is even, it appends the first element of `array` and increments the index.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Permutation Validity:**
  - The function ensures that the permutation contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, which is a valid permutation.

- **k-Level Permutation:**
  - The key requirement is that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
  - The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced. By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the function minimizes the difference in sums between consecutive segments.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Output: `2 1`
  - Sums: `2 + 1 = 3`
  - The only segment sum is 3, which trivially satisfies the condition.

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - Output: `1 3 2`
  - Sums: `1 + 3 = 4`, `3 + 2 = 5`
  - The maximum sum is 5 and the minimum sum is 4, and the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - Output: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
  - Sums: `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`, `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`, `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`, `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`, `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, and the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 13`, `k = 4`
  - Output: `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
  - Sums: `4 + 10 + 1 + 13 = 28`, `10 + 1 + 13 + 5 = 29`, `1 + 13 + 5 + 9 = 28`, `13 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 29`, `5 + 9 + 2 + 12 = 28`, `9 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 29`, `2 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 28`, `12 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 29`, `6 + 8 + 3 + 11 = 28`, `8 + 3 + 11 + 7 = 29`
  - The maximum sum is 29 and the minimum sum is 28, and the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

- **Example 5:**
  - `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - Output: `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`
  - Sums: `1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17`, `6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18`, `3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17`, `7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18`
  - The maximum sum is 18 and the minimum sum is 17, and the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness: **True**
