You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function generates and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` for each test case, arranged in a specific pattern: the first element is always 1, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the original array. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4 2
```
The program will output:
```
1 4 2 3
```
However, the sums of the continuous segments of length 2 are:
- \( p_1 + p_2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \)
- \( p_2 + p_3 = 4 + 2 = 6 \)
- \( p_3 + p_4 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)

Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 5, so the difference is 1, which is acceptable. However, the program's logic is not guaranteed to always produce such a permutation. For example, consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
6 2
```
The program will output:
```
1 6 2 5 3 4
```
The sums of the continuous segments of length 2 are:
- \( p_1 + p_2 = 1 + 6 = 7 \)
- \( p_2 + p_3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \)
- \( p_3 + p_4 = 2 + 5 = 7 \)
- \( p_4 + p_5 = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
- \( p_5 + p_6 = 3 + 4 = 7 \)

Here, the maximum sum is 8 and the minimum sum is 7, so the difference is 1, which is acceptable. However, the program's logic is not robust and can fail in more complex cases. For example, consider:
```
Input:
1
10 4
```
The program will output:
```
1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
```
The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
- \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22 \)
- \( p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
- \( p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22 \)
- \( p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 = 9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24 \)
- \( p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 = 3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22 \)
- \( p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
- \( p_7 + p_8 + p_9 + p_10 = 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22 \)

Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, so the difference is 2, which does not meet the requirement that any two sums differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
