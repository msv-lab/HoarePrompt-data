The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose 3 distinct indices i, j, k such that a_i = a_j = a_k. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0 for that test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variable `buffer` remains an empty list.
