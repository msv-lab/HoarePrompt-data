The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts another parameter `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in a list, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. Additionally, it accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the general functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each with a list of integers, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a parameter `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
