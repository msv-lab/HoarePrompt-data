Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a flag. This is not the correct way to determine if an array is beautiful according to the problem description. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by performing the specified operation.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the occurrences of the first element and then finding the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual operations needed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the array is already non-beautiful or when it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array is already non-beautiful.
- If the array is beautiful, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_beautiful(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]
    return len(set(arr)) == 1

def min_elements_to_remove(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n <= 2:
        return -1
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        return -1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] != arr[i + 1]:
            return 1
    return -1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_elements_to_remove(arr))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **is_beautiful Function**:
   - This function simulates the operations to make the array beautiful and checks if all elements are the same.

2. **min_elements_to_remove Function**:
   - This function checks if the array is already non-beautiful or if it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array has only one or two elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
   - If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
   - If there is any element that does not satisfy the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), then removing one such element will make the array non-beautiful.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs -1 if it is impossible.
