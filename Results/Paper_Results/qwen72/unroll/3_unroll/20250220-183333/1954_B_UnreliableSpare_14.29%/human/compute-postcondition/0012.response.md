The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **-1**
