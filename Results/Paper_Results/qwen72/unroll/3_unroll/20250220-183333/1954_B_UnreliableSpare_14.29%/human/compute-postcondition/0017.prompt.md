You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as parameters. Additionally, the function is part of a solution that processes multiple test cases, so it should also take the number of test cases `t` as an input, though this is typically handled in the outer loop of the program rather than being passed to the function for each test case. The array `a` is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. `ans` is set to the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` (the first element of `arr`) found in the array, or remains Decimal('Infinity') if no such consecutive elements are found. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of the previous value of ans and the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of arr)
    #State: *The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array. `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` was initially True, it remains True, and all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same. If `flag` was initially False, it remains False, and there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are different.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function should accept a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n`. It processes the list to determine if it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation and returns the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
