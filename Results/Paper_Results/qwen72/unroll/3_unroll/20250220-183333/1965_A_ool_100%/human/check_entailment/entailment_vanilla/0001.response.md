### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone. If so, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]` (the smallest pile size), which will empty all piles at once.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the function then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and iterating through them.
   - If the differences are all 1, the function toggles the boolean `A` one more time to account for the final move.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]`, which will empty all piles.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the game becomes more complex. The key observation is that if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, the game is essentially a sequence of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone at a time. This means the game will end in a fixed number of moves, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of moves.
   - If the differences are not all 1, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a position where the differences are all 1, ensuring Alice's win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile has more than 1 stone correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the smallest pile has 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1 correctly.
   - The program correctly toggles the boolean `A` to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses sorting and set operations, which are efficient given the constraints. Sorting a list of up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements is feasible within the time limits.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and the optimal play strategy correctly.

### Correctness:
