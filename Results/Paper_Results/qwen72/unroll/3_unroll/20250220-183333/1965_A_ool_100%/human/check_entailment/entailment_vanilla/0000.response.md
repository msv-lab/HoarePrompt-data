### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the array `arr` representing the number of stones in each pile.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` using `set(arr)` and `sort()`.
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice wins immediately because she can choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size and empty all piles in one move.
   - The program then checks if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set are all 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it breaks the loop and sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each unique pile size, except the first one.
   - If all differences are 1, `A` is toggled one more time.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game, but with a twist where the player can remove `k` stones from each nonempty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The key insight is that if the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the game becomes more complex. The program checks if the pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1. If they are, the game is essentially a series of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile, and the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of piles is even, and win if the number of piles is odd.
   - The program toggles `A` for each unique pile size, which is a correct approach to simulate the alternating moves of Alice and Bob.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - The program should work for the given constraints, including large inputs.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the winner for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. It handles all edge cases and follows the correct approach to simulate the game.

**Correctness: True**
