You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    3 3 3 3 3
    
    2
    
    1 7

    1 3 9 7 4 2 100
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    6
    
    2 1 3 4 2 4
    
    8
    
    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
c = 1
while t > 0:
    n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if set_[0] != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        A = not A
    if not_c:
        A = not A
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers. It checks if the list contains all consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not contain all consecutive integers starting from 1, or if the smallest integer is not 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list contains all consecutive integers starting from 1, the function returns 'Bob'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the program's logic does not account for this scenario properly. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The program will return "Alice" because the smallest pile size is not 1, and it does not check if all pile sizes are the same. In this specific case, Alice should indeed win, but the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly identify the win condition for all cases. For instance, if the input is:

```
1
3
1 2 3
```

The program will return "Alice", which is correct. However, if the input is:

```
1
2
1 7
```

The program will return "Bob", which is also correct. But the logic is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, such as when all piles have the same number of stones. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
