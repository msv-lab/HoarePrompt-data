The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `set_`. For the loop to execute, `range(1, len(set_))` must contain at least one value, which means `len(set_)` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1, and `set_` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in `arr` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `A` is False.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
- `not_c` is True.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `set_` must have at least two elements, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in `arr` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1, `set_` must have at least 2 elements; `not_c` is True; `i` is 1**
