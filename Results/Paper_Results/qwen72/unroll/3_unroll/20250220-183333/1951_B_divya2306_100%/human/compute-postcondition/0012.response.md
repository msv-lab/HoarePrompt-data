To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`win_with_swap`**: This is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive) plus the number of elements from `a[k - 1]` to `a[k - 2]` (inclusive) that are also less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`.
2. **`i`**: This is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` starting from `win_with_swap` or `k - 1` if no such element exists.
3. **`wins`**: This variable remains unchanged.
4. **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged.
5. **`k`**: This variable remains unchanged.
6. **`ratings`**: This variable remains unchanged.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```
print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`wins - 1`**: This is a straightforward subtraction of 1 from the value of `wins`.
2. **`win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`**:
   - **`win_with_swap - wins - 1`**: Subtract `wins` and 1 from `win_with_swap`.
   - **`(wins != 0)`**: This is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if `wins` is not 0, and 0 if `wins` is 0.
   - **`win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`**: Add the result of the boolean expression to `win_with_swap - wins - 1`.

3. **`max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))`**:
   - The `max` function will return the larger of the two values: `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- **If `wins` is 0**:
  - `wins - 1` = 0 - 1 = -1
  - `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` = `win_with_swap - 0 - 1 + 0` = `win_with_swap - 1`
  - `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` = `max(-1, win_with_swap - 1)`

- **If `wins` is not 0**:
  - `wins - 1` = `wins - 1`
  - `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` = `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + 1` = `win_with_swap - wins`
  - `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` = `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins)`

### Final Output:
- If `wins` is 0, the output will be `max(-1, win_with_swap - 1)`.
- If `wins` is not 0, the output will be `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins)`.

Since the exact values of `wins` and `win_with_swap` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is the value of `wins` and `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive) plus the number of elements from `a[k - 1]` to `a[k - 2]` (inclusive) that are also less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`)**
