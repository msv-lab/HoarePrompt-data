To determine what will be printed by the `print(wins - 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive).
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
   - `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding `wins`**:
   - `wins` is defined as the count of elements in the list `a` from the first element to the `k-1`-th element (inclusive) that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`.
   - Since `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that at least the first `k` elements of `a` are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`.

3. **Understanding `wins - 1`**:
   - The `print(wins - 1)` statement will print the value of `wins` minus 1.
   - Given that `wins` is the count of elements from the first to the `k-1`-th element that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, and `wins` is at least `k`, `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The exact value of `wins` is not provided, but we know it is at least `k`.
   - Therefore, `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`.

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)**
