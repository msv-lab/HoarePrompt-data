Output State: **`wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged, and `wins` is less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `win_with_swap` is calculated as `wins + 1`.
- The values of `wins`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `wins` is less than `k` still holds.
