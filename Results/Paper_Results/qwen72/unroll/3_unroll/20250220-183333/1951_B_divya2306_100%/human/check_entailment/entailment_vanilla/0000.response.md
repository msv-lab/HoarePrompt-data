### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `a`.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `wins` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list of ratings `a` to count how many matches your cow can win without any swaps.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - The number of wins is correctly calculated by incrementing `wins` for each match your cow wins.

3. **Handling the Initial Wins**:
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means your cow can win all the matches up to its original position without any swaps.
   - In this case, the program prints `wins - 1` and returns, which is correct because the cow cannot win the match against itself.

4. **Wins with Swap Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1` to account for the initial win plus the win after the swap.
   - It then iterates through the list of ratings from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` to count how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - The number of wins with the swap is correctly calculated by incrementing `win_with_swap` for each match your cow wins after the swap.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1` accounts for the number of wins after the swap, minus the initial wins, minus one for the swap itself.
   - The term `(wins != 0)` ensures that if your cow wins at least one match without swapping, it is counted correctly.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either without swapping or with an optimal swap. The logic and the output are consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
