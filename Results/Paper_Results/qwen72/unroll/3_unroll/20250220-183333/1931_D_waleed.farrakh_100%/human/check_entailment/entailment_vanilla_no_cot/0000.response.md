Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the results list and returns the results list.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - It splits the input into lines and processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the input.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `(-a_i % x + x) % x == (a_j % x)`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `(a_i % y) == (a_j % y)`.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and the logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
