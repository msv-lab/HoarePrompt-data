Output State: **The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the first element of the list `data`. The variable `test_cases` is an empty list. The function `func_2()` still reads input from standard input, processes it, and constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The variable `data` is still a list of strings, each string being a line from the input. No other variables are affected.**
