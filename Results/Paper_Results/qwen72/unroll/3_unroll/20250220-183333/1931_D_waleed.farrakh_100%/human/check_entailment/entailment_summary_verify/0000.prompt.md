You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#Function 1:
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        count = 0

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input, processes it, and constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints each result from `func_1` to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` contains the constructed test cases, and `results` contains the output of `func_1`. The variable `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. No other variables are affected.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The logic in `func_1` uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count pairs \((i, j)\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The key \((rx, ry)\) in the dictionary represents the remainders when \(-a_i\) is divided by \(x\) and \(a_i\) is divided by \(y\), respectively. This ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met. The program also correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description. After reviewing the logic and testing it with various inputs, I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
