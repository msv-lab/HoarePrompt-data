Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The logic in `func_1` uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count pairs \((i, j)\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The key \((rx, ry)\) in the dictionary represents the remainders when \(-a_i\) is divided by \(x\) and \(a_i\) is divided by \(y\), respectively. This ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met. The program also correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description. After reviewing the logic and testing it with various inputs, I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
