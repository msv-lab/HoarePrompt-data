No variables are passed to the function `func_2()`. The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array.
