Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. Each `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The variable `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. The variable `results` is the output of the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
