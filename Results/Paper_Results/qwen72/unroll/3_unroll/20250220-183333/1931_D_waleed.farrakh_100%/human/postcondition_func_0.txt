The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element is an integer representing the count of distinct pairs `(a, b)` in the corresponding `arr` such that `(-a % x + x) % x == b % x` and `a % y == b % y`. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `test_cases`. The function does not modify the input `test_cases` and the final state of the program includes the `results` list with the computed counts for each test case.
