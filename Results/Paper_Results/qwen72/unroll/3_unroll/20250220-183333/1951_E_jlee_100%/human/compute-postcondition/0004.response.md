Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string from the input. For each string, the function determines if it can be split into two non-empty substrings that are not equal. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1 or 2, and the original string or the two split substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t` and `s` retain their initial values, but the list `s` will be modified to the last input string's list of characters if the loop did not print 'NO' for that string. **
