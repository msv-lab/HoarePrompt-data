You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()

        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string from the input. For each string, the function determines if it can be split into two non-empty substrings that are not equal. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1 or 2, and the original string or the two split substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t` and `s` retain their initial values, but the list `s` will be modified to the last input string's list of characters if the loop did not print 'NO' for that string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list `s` for easier manipulation.
   - It then determines the length of the string `n`.

2. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string has only one character (`n == 1`), it is a palindrome by definition, so the function prints "NO" and continues to the next test case.

3. **First and Last Character Check**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the entire string is not a palindrome, and the function prints "YES" with a partition of the entire string (`string`).

4. **All Characters the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the string is a palindrome, and the function prints "NO".

5. **Almost All Characters the Same**:
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string is of odd length and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with a partition of the entire string.

6. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first and last characters.
   - If it finds such positions, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts, ensuring that neither part is a palindrome.
   - If no such positions are found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Single Character String**:
  - Correct: A single character string is always a palindrome, so the function correctly prints "NO".

- **First and Last Character Check**:
  - Correct: If the first and last characters are different, the entire string is not a palindrome, and the function correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **All Characters the Same**:
  - Correct: If all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome, and the function correctly prints "NO".

- **Almost All Characters the Same**:
  - Correct: If all but one character are the same, the function correctly checks if the string is of odd length and the middle character is different. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **General Case**:
  - The function attempts to find the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first and last characters.
  - If it finds such positions, it partitions the string into two parts and ensures that neither part is a palindrome.
  - However, there is a logical flaw in the general case handling:
    - The function does not correctly handle cases where the string has more than two different characters but still cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

### Example of Logical Flaw:
- Consider the string `abba`. The function will iterate through the string and find that `a` and `b` are different at positions 1 and 2. However, the partition `a bb a` is not valid because `bb` is a palindrome. The function should instead partition the string into `ab b a` or `abb a`.

### Conclusion:
The function is mostly correct but has a logical flaw in the general case handling. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
