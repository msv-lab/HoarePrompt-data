Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def partition_non_palindromes(t, test_cases):
```

This function will then process `t` test cases, where `test_cases` is a list of strings, each of which needs to be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
