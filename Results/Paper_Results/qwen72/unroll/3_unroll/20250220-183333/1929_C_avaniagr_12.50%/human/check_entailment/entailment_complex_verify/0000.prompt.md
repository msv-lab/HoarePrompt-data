You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    9
    
    2 1 7
    
    2 1 1
    
    2 3 15
    
    3 3 6
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 4 7
    
    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and process multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x, and a such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated to their respective values for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the values from the last test case. The variable `z` will be updated within the loop for each test case where `x` is greater than `k - 1`, but its final value will be the one computed for the last test case where `x` is greater than `k - 1`. The loop counter `_` will have completed all `t` iterations and will no longer be in use.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether the value of `a` meets certain conditions based on `k` and `x`, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block where `x >= k - 1` is not correct. The calculation of `z` in the loop is flawed and does not accurately represent the number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee he can achieve any number of coins.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 2 10
```
According to the problem description, Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins, we need to check if he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x`) and still have enough coins to continue betting. The correct logic should be:

1. If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can place bets of 1 coin and recover from any loss sequence.
2. If `x >= k - 1`, Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and still have enough to place a bet that will recover his losses and allow him to continue.

The correct condition for `x >= k - 1` should be:
- Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and still have 1 coin left to place a bet.
- Additionally, he needs to have enough coins to ensure that after `x` losses, he can place a bet that will recover his losses and still have enough coins to continue.

The correct logic should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            if a >= (x + 1) * (k - 1) + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

This ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario and still have a chance to recover and continue betting. The original program fails to handle this correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.
