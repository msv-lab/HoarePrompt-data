Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the list of integers, reverses them, and constructs a new string `rev_res`. If the length of the reversed number is the same as the original, it is directly appended to `rev_res`. Otherwise, the reversed number is added to a list `rev_val`. After processing all numbers, `rev_val` is sorted, and its elements are alternately appended to `rev_res` in their original and reversed forms. Finally, if the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\), it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
