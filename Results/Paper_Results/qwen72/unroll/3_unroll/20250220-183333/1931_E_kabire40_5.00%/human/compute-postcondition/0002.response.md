The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers, `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The constraints are as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
- The list `a` contains `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the question. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
