### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `list_len` and `max_power` from the input, which represent `n` and `m` respectively.
   - It also reads a list of integers `operational_list` from the input.

2. **Reversing Digits**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `rev_val` and an empty string `rev_res`.
   - It iterates over each integer in `operational_list`, reverses the digits, and checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer.
   - If the lengths are the same, the reversed integer is directly appended to `rev_res`.
   - If the lengths are different, the reversed integer is added to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Alternating Appends**:
   - The list `rev_val` is sorted.
   - The program then iterates over `rev_val` and alternately appends the elements to `rev_res` in their original and reversed forms.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - After constructing `rev_res`, the program checks if the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Type Conversion**:
  - The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are read as strings but should be converted to integers before use.
  - The elements of `operational_list` are also read as strings and should be converted to integers.

- **Reversing and Length Check**:
  - The length check `if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)` is incorrect because `x` is a string, and `x_rev` is an integer. The correct check should be `if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)`.

- **Appending to `rev_res`**:
  - The program appends the reversed integers to `rev_res` in a way that does not necessarily reflect the optimal play. The optimal play involves strategic choices that are not captured by the current logic.

- **Final Comparison**:
  - The final comparison `if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res)` is correct in terms of checking if the constructed number is greater than \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\).

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the optimal play strategy for both players. The logic for appending elements to `rev_res` and the handling of reversed integers is flawed, which can lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
