The function `func` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`. `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` is the visibility duration of each firework. All parameters are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns the total number of fireworks that are visible at any point in time, considering the frequencies and visibility duration of the fireworks from both installations.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`, all of which are integers within the range 1 to 10^18. It returns the total number of fireworks that are visible at any point in time, given the frequencies of launching fireworks from two installations (`a` and `b`) and the visibility duration of each firework (`m`).**
