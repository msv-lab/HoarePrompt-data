Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks from two installations, and `m` is the visibility duration of each firework. The function then calculates and prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are undefined or reset for each iteration. **
