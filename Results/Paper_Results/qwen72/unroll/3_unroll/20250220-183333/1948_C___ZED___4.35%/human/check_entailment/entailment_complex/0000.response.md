### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.

2. **Second-to-Last Arrow Check:**
   - The function first checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>'. If it is not, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it would be impossible to move to the last column from the second-to-last column in the bottom row. This check is correct.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem constraints specify that `n` is always at least 2. This check can be removed without affecting the correctness of the function.

4. **Path Existence Check:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path from the left to the right side of the grid by ensuring that every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'.
   - The logic here is flawed. The function should check if there is any way for the robot to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. The current implementation only checks specific patterns in the arrows, which may not cover all possible paths.

5. **Correct Path Checking:**
   - To determine if the robot can reach (2, n), we need to simulate the robot's movements from (1, 1) to (2, n) and check if it is possible to reach the target cell.
   - The function should simulate the robot's movements by following the arrows and ensuring it can move to the next cell without getting stuck.

### Correctness:
The given program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movements to determine if it can reach the cell (2, n). The current implementation only checks specific patterns in the arrows, which is insufficient to cover all possible paths.

### Correctness: **False**
