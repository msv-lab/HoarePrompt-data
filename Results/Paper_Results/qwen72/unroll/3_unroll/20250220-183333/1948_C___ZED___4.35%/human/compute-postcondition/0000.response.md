The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment by 1 for each iteration. The initial state provided does not directly affect the loop head, but it provides context for the expected input and constraints.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input is a positive integer, and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
