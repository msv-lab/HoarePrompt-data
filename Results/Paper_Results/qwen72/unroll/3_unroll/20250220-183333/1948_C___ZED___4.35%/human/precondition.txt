t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second and third lines of each test case are strings of length n, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
