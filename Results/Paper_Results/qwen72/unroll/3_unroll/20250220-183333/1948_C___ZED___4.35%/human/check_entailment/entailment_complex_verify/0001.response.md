### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Check for the Last Column:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell `(2, n)` because it cannot move to the right from the second-to-last cell.
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, making this check redundant.
   - This check is incorrect and should be removed.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function attempts to check if there is a path from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)` by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It first checks if there is a path in the second row (`b`) by iterating through the even-indexed cells (0, 2, 4, ...).
   - If any even-indexed cell in the second row does not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Then, it checks if there is a path in the first row (`a`) by iterating through the odd-indexed cells (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - If any odd-indexed cell in the first row does not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Path Determination:**
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, it prints `YES`, indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Issues:
- The special case for `n == 1` is incorrect and should be removed.
- The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function only checks if the robot can move to the right in the even and odd positions, but it does not consider the combined effect of the robot's movements and the arrows in the grid.
- Specifically, the function does not check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or vice versa, which is crucial for determining the path.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)`.
- It must be able to move to the second row at some point to reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The robot can only move to the second row if it encounters a cell in the first row that points down (`>`).
- Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the right until it reaches the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The robot can also move back to the first row if it encounters a cell in the second row that points up (`<`).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the second-to-last cell in the second row is not pointing to the right
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the second row
        can_move_to_second_row = False
        for k in range(n):
            if a[k] == '>':
                can_move_to_second_row = True
                break
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the right in the second row
        can_move_to_right_in_second_row = True
        for k in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if b[k] == '<':
                can_move_to_right_in_second_row = False
                break
        
        if can_move_to_second_row and can_move_to_right_in_second_row:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Evaluation of the Original Program:
- The original program's logic for path checking is flawed. It only checks if the robot can move to the right in the even and odd positions, which is insufficient.
- The special case for `n == 1` is redundant and should be removed.
- The function does not correctly simulate the robot's movements and the combined effect of the arrows in the grid.

### Final Answer:
The original program is **incorrect** due to the redundant `n == 1` check and the flawed path checking logic.

Final: **False**
