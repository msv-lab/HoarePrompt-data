Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in handling the movement of the robot. Specifically, the condition `if n == 1` is incorrect because the problem description guarantees that `n` is always even and at least 2. Therefore, this condition will never be true and can be removed.

Additionally, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. The program checks if the second row's second-to-last cell (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`'>'`). If it is not, it immediately prints 'NO', which is incorrect because the robot can still potentially reach the cell (2, n) through other paths.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
><<<
><<<
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this example, the robot can move as follows:
1. (1, 1) → (1, 2) (due to the arrow in (1, 1) pointing right)
2. (1, 2) → (2, 2) (due to the arrow in (1, 2) pointing down)
3. (2, 2) → (2, 1) (due to the arrow in (2, 2) pointing left)
4. (2, 1) → (2, 2) (due to the arrow in (2, 1) pointing right)
5. (2, 2) → (2, 3) (due to the arrow in (2, 2) pointing right)
6. (2, 3) → (2, 4) (due to the arrow in (2, 3) pointing right)

The robot successfully reaches the cell (2, 4), but the program incorrectly prints 'NO'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
