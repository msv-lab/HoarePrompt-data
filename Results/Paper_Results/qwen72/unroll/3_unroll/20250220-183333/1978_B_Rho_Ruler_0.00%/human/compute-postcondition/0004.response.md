The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b). `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function always returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, where `k` is an integer between 0 and the minimum of `n` and `b`, and `a`, `b`, and `n` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function always returns `True`.**
