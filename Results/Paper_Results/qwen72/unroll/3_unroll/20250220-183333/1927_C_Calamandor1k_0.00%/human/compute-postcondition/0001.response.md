The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is already given to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a common placeholder in Python, indicating that the value of the loop variable is not used inside the loop. Therefore, no specific state needs to be adjusted for `_`.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1, and it is already stated that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the state does not need to be modified.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
