t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). The arrays a and b are lists of integers, where a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and b contains m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6).
