Output State: **The `dp` table is filled from the bottom up, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed starting from index `i` in the `cards` list, with the last card used being `j+1`. The final state of `dp` will reflect the optimal solutions for all subproblems, and the value of `dp[0][0]` will be the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire `cards` list. The values of `n`, `a`, and `cards` remain unchanged.**
