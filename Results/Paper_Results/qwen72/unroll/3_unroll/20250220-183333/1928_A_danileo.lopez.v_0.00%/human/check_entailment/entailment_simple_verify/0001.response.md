Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle should be different from the original rectangle in terms of its dimensions, considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - To form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because:
     - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles and then form a new rectangle of size \((a/2) \times (2b)\).
     - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times (b/2)\) rectangles and then form a new rectangle of size \((2a) \times (b/2)\).

3. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input \(1 \times 1\), both dimensions are odd, so the output is 'No' (correct).
   - For the input \(2 \times 1\), \(a\) is even, so the output should be 'Yes' (the original assessment incorrectly states 'No').
   - For the input \(2 \times 6\), \(a\) is even, so the output is 'Yes' (correct).
   - For the input \(3 \times 2\), \(b\) is even, so the output is 'Yes' (correct).
   - For the input \(2 \times 2\), both dimensions are even, so the output is 'Yes' (correct).
   - For the input \(2 \times 4\), \(a\) is even, so the output is 'Yes' (correct).
   - For the input \(6 \times 3\), \(a\) is even, so the output should be 'Yes' (the original assessment incorrectly states 'No').

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle based on the given conditions.
   - However, the original assessment has a few inaccuracies in the verification with examples, specifically for the cases \(2 \times 1\) and \(6 \times 3\).

Final: **True** (The program is correct, but the original assessment had some inaccuracies in the verification examples.)
