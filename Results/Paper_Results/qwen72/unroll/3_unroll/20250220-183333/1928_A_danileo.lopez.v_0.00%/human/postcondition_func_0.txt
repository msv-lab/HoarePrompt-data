The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the last input values of `a` and `b` from the last test case, and `t` remains unchanged.
