The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The current state indicates that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify whether `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integers n, x, and y, and a list of x integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Specifically, for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is always 0. The list of vertices Bessie has chosen contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The program is currently executing in the main module, meaning the code is running as a standalone script and not being imported as a module. `t` must be greater than 0.**
