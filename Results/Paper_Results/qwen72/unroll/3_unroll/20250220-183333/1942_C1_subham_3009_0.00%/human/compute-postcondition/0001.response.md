Output State: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integers n, x, and y, and a list of x integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Specifically, for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is always 0. The list of vertices Bessie has chosen contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The program is currently executing in the main module, meaning the code is running as a standalone script and not being imported as a module. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
