t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5). Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, and it is guaranteed that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph.
