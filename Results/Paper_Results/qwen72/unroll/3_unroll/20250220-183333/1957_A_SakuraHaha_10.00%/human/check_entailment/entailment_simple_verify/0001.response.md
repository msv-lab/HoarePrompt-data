### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It correctly reads the number of sticks `n` for the current test case.
   - It correctly reads the lengths of the sticks into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It creates a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and updates the dictionary `cnt` to count how many times each stick length appears. This part is correct.

4. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` (which represent the counts of each stick length).
   - For each count `x`, it adds `x // 4` to `ans`. This is based on the assumption that only squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed, which is incorrect. Regular polygons can have more than 4 sides, and the program should consider all possible regular polygons (3-sided, 4-sided, 5-sided, etc.).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case. However, since the calculation of `ans` is incorrect, the output will also be incorrect for test cases where other regular polygons can be formed.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Polygons:**
  - The program only considers squares (4-sided polygons) and ignores other possible regular polygons. This is a significant flaw in the logic.
  - For example, in the third test case, the program should be able to form a square with 4 sticks of length 3, but it should also be able to form other regular polygons like equilateral triangles (3-sided) or pentagons (5-sided) if there are enough sticks of the same length.

### Correct Calculation:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible regular polygons, not just squares. For each stick length `x`, the number of polygons that can be formed is `x // k` where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon. The maximum number of polygons that can be formed is the sum of `x // k` for all possible `k` (3, 4, 5, ...).

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it only considers squares and not other regular polygons.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
