Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it only considers the possibility of forming squares (4-sided polygons) and does not account for other regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.). The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, not just squares. Therefore, the program should check for the possibility of forming polygons with any number of sides, not just 4.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, n + 1):  # Check for polygons with 3 to n sides
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)
```

This version of the program correctly considers all possible regular polygons with 3 or more sides and calculates the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed.
