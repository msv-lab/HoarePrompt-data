### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It creates a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and updates the dictionary `cnt` to count how many times each stick length appears. This is done correctly.

4. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` (which represent the counts of each stick length).
   - For each count `x`, it adds `x // 4` to `ans`. This is based on the assumption that only squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed, which is incorrect. Regular polygons can have more than 4 sides, and the number of polygons that can be formed for a given stick length `x` should be `x // k` where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon. The maximum number of polygons that can be formed is the sum of `x // k` for all possible `k` (3, 4, 5, ...).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, but this value is incorrect because it only considers squares.

### Correct Calculation:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible regular polygons, not just squares. For each stick length `x`, the number of polygons that can be formed is `x // k` where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon. The maximum number of polygons that can be formed is the sum of `x // k` for all possible `k` (3, 4, 5, ...).

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect because it only considers squares and not other regular polygons. The function summary confirms that the program only calculates the number of squares, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
