#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of stick lengths from the list `a`, and each value is the count of how many times that tuple appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is the same dictionary.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of stick lengths, and then reads `n` integers from the user, representing the stick lengths. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length and calculates the number of groups of four identical stick lengths. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the integer `n`, the list of integers `a` (which are the stick lengths), and the dictionary `cnt` (which maps each stick length to its count). The printed value is the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
