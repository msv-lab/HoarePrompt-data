The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of stick lengths, and then reads `n` integers from the user, representing the stick lengths. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length and calculates the number of groups of four identical stick lengths. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the integer `n`, the list of integers `a` (which are the stick lengths), and the dictionary `cnt` (which maps each stick length to its count). The printed value is the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
