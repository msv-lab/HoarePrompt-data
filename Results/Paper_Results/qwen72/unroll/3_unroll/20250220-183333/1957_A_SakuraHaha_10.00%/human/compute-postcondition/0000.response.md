Output State: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. `n` is now an input integer.**
