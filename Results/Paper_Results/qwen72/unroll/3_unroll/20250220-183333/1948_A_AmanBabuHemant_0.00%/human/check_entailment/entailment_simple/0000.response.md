### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must always be part of a pair (e.g., "AA" or "MM"), and thus the number of such pairs must be even.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "110" `n // 2` times. This is a valid approach because:
   - Each "110" pattern contributes exactly 2 special characters (the two '1's).
   - The length of the string `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n` in the range [1, 50].

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `s` if `n` is even and the string length is within the limit. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and handling of the problem constraints. However, the length check is redundant and can be removed to simplify the code. Despite this, the program will still produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
