Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the length of the string '110' repeated `n // 2` times is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string. If `n` is even and the length of the string is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
