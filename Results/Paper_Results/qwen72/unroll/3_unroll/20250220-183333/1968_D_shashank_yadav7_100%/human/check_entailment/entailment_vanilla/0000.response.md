### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is correct since Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as the score increases by the value at the starting position on the first turn.

4. **Simulation of Game Turns:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is correct because the permutation is 1-based, and we need to convert it to 0-based for array indexing.
   - It updates the scores by adding the value at the current position to the respective player's score.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible score for each player by considering the remaining turns and the current position. However, this part of the logic is flawed.
   - The variables `bm` and `sm` are supposed to represent the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, but they are not correctly calculated. The program uses a formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the actual movement and score accumulation over the turns.

6. **Score Comparison:**
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `sm` is greater than `bm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the game is a draw.

### Issues:
- The logic for calculating the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The program should not use the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` to determine the maximum possible score. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores over the `k` turns as the players move according to the permutation.
- The variable `k` is decremented inside the loop, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if `k` is not reset for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program correctly simulates the game by accumulating the scores over `k` turns and determining the winner based on the final scores.
- The original program's logic for calculating the maximum possible scores is incorrect and unnecessary.

Correctness: **False**
