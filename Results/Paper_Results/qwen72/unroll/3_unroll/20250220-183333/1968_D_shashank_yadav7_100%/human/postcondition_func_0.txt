The function `func` processes a series of game scenarios. For each scenario, it reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then iterates through each test case, updating the positions and scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation and the array. After processing each test case, it prints the result indicating whether Bodya, Sasha, or neither (a draw) has a higher score. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
