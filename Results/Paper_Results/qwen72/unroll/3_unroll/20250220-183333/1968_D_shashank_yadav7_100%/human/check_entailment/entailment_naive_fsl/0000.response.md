Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and the positions of the players. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by iterating `k` times and updating the scores based on the current position and the remaining turns. However, this approach does not accurately simulate the game as described. The game rules state that each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. The program does not correctly handle the decision-making process for staying or moving, which can lead to incorrect scores.

2. **Position Update**: The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by decrementing the permutation values by 1 (`p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`). This is incorrect because the positions in the permutation are 1-indexed, and the array indices are 0-indexed. The correct way to update the positions would be to use `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` without further decrementing.

3. **Score Update Logic**: The program updates the scores by adding the current position's value in array `a` and then calculates the maximum possible score based on the remaining turns. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the correct sequence of moves and stays that the players might make.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
- **Initial Positions**: Bodya starts at position 3, Sasha starts at position 2.
- **Initial Scores**: Bodya's score = 5, Sasha's score = 2.
- **First Turn**:
  - Bodya can either stay at position 3 (score = 5 + 5 = 10) or move to position 2 (score = 5 + 2 = 7).
  - Sasha can either stay at position 2 (score = 2 + 2 = 4) or move to position 1 (score = 2 + 7 = 9).
- **Second Turn**:
  - If Bodya stays at position 3, his score remains 10.
  - If Bodya moves to position 2, his score becomes 7 + 2 = 9.
  - If Sasha stays at position 2, his score remains 9.
  - If Sasha moves to position 1, his score becomes 9 + 7 = 16.

The correct output should be "Sasha" because Sasha can achieve a higher score. However, the provided program might output "Bodya" or "Draw" due to the incorrect score and position updates.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
