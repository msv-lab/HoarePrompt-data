The function `func` should accept the following parameters:
- `t`: the number of test cases, an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: the length of the permutation, an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `k`: the duration of the game, an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `P_B`: the starting position of Bodya, an integer where 1 ≤ P_B ≤ n.
- `P_S`: the starting position of Sasha, an integer where 1 ≤ P_S ≤ n.
- `p`: the permutation, a list of integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n.
- `a`: the array, a list of integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case, which is not specified in the provided output. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function returns a string indicating the winner of the game (e.g., "Bodya" or "Sasha") or a specific condition of the game.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`, and returns the result of the game for each test case, likely indicating the winner (e.g., "Bodya" or "Sasha") or a specific game condition.**
