### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
   - The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i + 1}`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `la` and `lb` to `n + 1`, which is a value greater than any possible element in the array.
   - The variable `ans` is used to keep track of the penalty.
   - The program iterates through each element `i` in the input array `inp`.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it updates `la` to `lb`, `lb` to `i`, and increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The idea is to maintain two variables `la` and `lb` to track the smallest and second smallest elements seen so far.
   - If an element `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it means that `i` is a new element that can potentially create a penalty when added to either `s` or `t`.
   - By updating `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, the program ensures that the new element `i` is the second smallest element seen so far, and it increments the penalty `ans` by 1.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For an array with all elements being the same (e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`), the penalty will be 0 because no element is greater than the previous one.
   - For an array with only one element (e.g., `[1]`), the penalty will also be 0 because there are no indices `i` such that `1 <= i < m - 1`.
   - For an array with two elements (e.g., `[2, 1]`), the penalty will be 0 because the array is already in non-increasing order.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the test cases provided in the example:
     - For `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = []`, resulting in a penalty of 3.
     - For `a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, the optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1.
     - For `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 0.
     - For `a = [1]`, the optimal split is `s = [1]` and `t = []`, resulting in a penalty of 0.
     - For `a = [2, 1]`, the optimal split is `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of 0.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements and incrementing the penalty only when necessary.
