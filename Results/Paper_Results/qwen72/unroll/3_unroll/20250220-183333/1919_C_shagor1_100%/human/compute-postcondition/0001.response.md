The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is determined based on the input `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the values of `n` and `a`.**
