Output State: **The function has not performed any operations, so the initial state remains unchanged: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples is provided where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
