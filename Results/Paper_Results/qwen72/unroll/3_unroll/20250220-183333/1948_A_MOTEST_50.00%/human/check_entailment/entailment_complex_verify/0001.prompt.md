You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string or a specific message based on the problem description.

        n = int(input())

                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time taking an integer `n` as input. For each iteration: If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` constructed from the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, starting from 'A'. If `n` is odd, the string starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern. The variable `s` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not return any value but performs the following actions: It first clears the console screen. It then reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, it consists of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AABBCC' for `n = 6`). If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the first `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AAABBC' for `n = 5`). The function does not modify any external state beyond printing to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the console using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm but does not affect the logic.
   - It then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a single character cannot have both a left and a right neighbor.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans`:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by adding pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then adds pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that the string has an odd number of special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Even `n`**:
  - For even `n`, the program correctly constructs a string of length `n` where each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, if `n = 6`, the string 'AAABBB' is valid because each 'A' and 'B' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- **Odd `n`**:
  - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs of the same character. This ensures that the string has an odd number of special characters. For example, if `n = 5`, the string 'AAABB' is valid because the first three 'A's and the last two 'B's are special characters.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1` by printing 'NO'.
  - The program ensures that the length of the string is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for even `n` and odd `n` greater than 1, and correctly reports 'NO' for `n == 1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
