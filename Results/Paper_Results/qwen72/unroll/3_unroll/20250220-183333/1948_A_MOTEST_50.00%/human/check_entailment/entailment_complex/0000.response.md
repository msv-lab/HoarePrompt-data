Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by printing 'NO'. This is correct because a string with exactly one special character cannot be constructed, as a special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot have both a left and a right neighbor.
3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the function constructs a string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters twice. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to one of its neighbors, meeting the requirement for `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the function starts with 'AAA' and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters twice. This also ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters, as the first three characters ('AAA') contribute 3 special characters, and the remaining characters follow the same pattern as the even case.
4. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid `n` values, and 'NO' for `n = 1`. The output format matches the problem description.
5. **Length Constraint**: The function ensures that the constructed string has a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

However, there is a minor issue with the program:
- The function uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console screen. This is specific to Windows and may not work on other operating systems. For cross-platform compatibility, it would be better to use `os.system('clear')` for Unix-based systems or a more general approach to clear the screen. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution in terms of the problem's requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the function's behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
