Precondition: **The function should take an integer n as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string or a specific message based on the problem description.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the function to correctly solve the problem, it should be defined as:

```python
def func(n):
```

With the precondition then being:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**
