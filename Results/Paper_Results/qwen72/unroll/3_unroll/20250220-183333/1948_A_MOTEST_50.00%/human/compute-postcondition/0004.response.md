Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, each time taking an integer `n` as input. For each iteration: If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` constructed from the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, starting from 'A'. If `n` is odd, the string starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern. The variable `s` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until the loop completes.**
