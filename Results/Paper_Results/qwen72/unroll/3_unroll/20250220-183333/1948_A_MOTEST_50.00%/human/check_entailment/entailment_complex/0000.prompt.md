Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string or a specific message based on the problem description.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time taking an integer `n` as input. For each iteration: If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` constructed from the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, starting from 'A'. If `n` is odd, the string starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern. The variable `s` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not return any value but performs the following actions: It first clears the console screen. It then reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, it consists of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AABBCC' for `n = 6`). If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the first `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AAABBC' for `n = 5`). The function does not modify any external state beyond printing to the console.
