The `os.system('cls')` command clears the console screen. It does not affect any variables or the function's input or return value. The initial state specifies that the function should take an integer `n` as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string or a specific message based on the problem description. Since the command only clears the screen and does not change the value of `n` or any other variable, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The function should take an integer `n` as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string or a specific message based on the problem description. The console screen is cleared.**
