You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` and prints this count. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of new problems to insert into the array `a` such that after each insertion and deletion of the most difficult problem, the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and each element `a[i]` is less than or equal to the corresponding element `b[i]`.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems needed.
   - It uses two pointers: `i` to track the current position in `a` and `j` to track the current position in `b`.
   - For each element in `b`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. If it is, it increments the counter `cnt` because a new problem is needed to make `a[i]` less than or equal to `b[j]`.
   - If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, it moves the pointer `i` to the next position in `a`.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of the program is to count the number of elements in `b` that are less than the current element in `a` and require a new problem to be inserted.
   - However, the program does not actually insert new problems or sort the array `a`. Instead, it just counts the number of times a new problem would be needed based on the comparison between `a` and `b`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (i.e., no new problems are needed).
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`, which would require the maximum number of new problems.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of new problems needed for each test case, which is the correct output format.

7. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For the first test case:
       - `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`
       - `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
       - The program will count the number of times `b[j] < a[i]`:
         - `b[0] < a[0]` (800 < 1000) -> `cnt = 1`
         - `b[1] < a[0]` (1200 < 1000) -> `cnt = 2`
         - `b[2] < a[0]` (1500 < 1000) -> `cnt = 3`
         - `b[3] < a[0]` (1800 < 1000) -> `cnt = 4`
         - `b[4] == a[4]` (2200 == 2200) -> `i = 1`
         - `b[5] > a[5]` (3000 > 2700) -> `i = 2`
       - The program will print `2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` as shown in the example.

     - For the second test case:
       - `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
       - `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
       - The program will count the number of times `b[j] < a[i]`:
         - `b[0] < a[0]` (1 < 4) -> `cnt = 1`
         - `b[1] < a[0]` (2 < 4) -> `cnt = 2`
         - `b[2] < a[0]` (3 < 4) -> `cnt = 3`
         - `b[3] == a[3]` (4 == 4) -> `i = 1`
         - `b[4] == a[4]` (5 == 5) -> `i = 2`
         - `b[5] == a[5]` (6 == 6) -> `i = 3`
       - The program will print `3`, which is correct.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion of elements in `a` to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
   - The program should insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` when `b[j] < a[i]` and then sort `a` and remove the last element, but it does not do this.
