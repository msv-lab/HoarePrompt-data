Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` and prints this count. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the function does not return any value. **
