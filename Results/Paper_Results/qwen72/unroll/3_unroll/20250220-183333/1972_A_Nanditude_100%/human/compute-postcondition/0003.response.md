The function `func` should accept three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `n`. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Both `a` and `b` are of length `n` and are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a specific value based on these inputs, but the exact output is not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers of length `n`, and `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value based on the provided lists and the integer `n`.**
