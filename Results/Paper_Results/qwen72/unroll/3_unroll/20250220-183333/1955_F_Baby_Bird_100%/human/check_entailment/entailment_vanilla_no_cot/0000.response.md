Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by determining the optimal removal of numbers by Eve to achieve a zero XOR sum, which is the winning condition for Bob. The logic in the program uses a formula to calculate the number of optimal removals, considering the properties of the XOR operation and the constraints of the problem (numbers in the sequence do not exceed 4). The program processes multiple test cases as required and outputs the correct results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
