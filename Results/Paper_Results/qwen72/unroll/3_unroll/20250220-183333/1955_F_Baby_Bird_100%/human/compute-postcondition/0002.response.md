Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` (where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\)) from the input. It then calculates a value for each test case based on a specific formula and prints the result of this calculation for each test case, each result being the sum of a modified sequence of the input integers divided by 3. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
