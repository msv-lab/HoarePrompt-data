You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` integers, where each integer except the last one is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last integer is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The value of `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of `n` integers. Each integer in the list, except the last one, is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The last integer in the list is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. After the function concludes, the value of `k` is reduced by `n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. In such a case, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` where each integer is at least 1. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program will still try to construct a sequence, but it will not be able to satisfy the condition that the sum of the sequence equals `k` while also ensuring that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

To illustrate, let's consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```
The program will attempt to construct a sequence of 5 integers that sum up to 3. However, the only valid sequence in this case would be `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` or any permutation thereof, but the program will not produce this sequence. Instead, it will try to set each integer to the maximum possible value, which will not work for this input.
