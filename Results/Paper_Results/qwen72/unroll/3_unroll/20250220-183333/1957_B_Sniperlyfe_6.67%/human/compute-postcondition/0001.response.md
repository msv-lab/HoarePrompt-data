The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `k` and `nums` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
