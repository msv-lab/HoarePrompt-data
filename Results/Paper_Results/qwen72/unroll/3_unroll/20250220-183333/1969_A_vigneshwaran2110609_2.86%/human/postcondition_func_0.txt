The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, and for each of the `n` iterations, it reads another integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from the user. For each `x`, it checks if there is any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and sets a flag to `True`. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` (if they exist) remain unchanged after the function execution.
