Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program prints `2` if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where such a pair does not exist and the minimum number of invitations required is still `2`. Additionally, the program prints `3` for all other cases, which is not always correct.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
3
2
```

The second test case is incorrect because the program does not correctly identify that the minimum number of invitations needed is `3` when there is a cycle of length greater than 2. The program simply prints `3` for all cases where it does not find a direct pair, which is not always the correct answer.
