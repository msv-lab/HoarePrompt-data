Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the logic used in the program is flawed. The program checks if there is any index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which is intended to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
1. **Condition Misinterpretation**: The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checking if the best friend of the best friend of the i-th friend is the i-th friend itself. This is a specific case and does not cover all scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
2. **General Case Handling**: The program prints `3` if no such pair is found, but this is not always the correct minimum number of invitations. For example, in the case where the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2, the minimum number of invitations needed could be different.
3. **Cycle Detection**: The problem requires detecting cycles in the friendship graph and determining the minimum number of invitations needed to break these cycles and ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The current program does not handle this properly.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify cycles in the friendship graph.
2. Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, considering the cycles and the structure of the graph.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
