### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` using a `defaultdict` of lists. This is a standard and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

2. **Leaf Nodes Identification**:
   - The program identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) and stores them in a `deque` named `leaves`. This is not strictly necessary for the solution but is a common step in tree problems.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the distances from the starting node to all its descendants. This function is recursive and correctly handles the tree traversal.
   - The base case of the recursion is when the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent). In this case, the function returns `[0]` because the distance to the leaf node from itself is 0.
   - For non-leaf nodes, the function recursively calculates the distances to all its children and their descendants, incrementing each distance by 1. This is correct because each move in the game involves moving to an adjacent node, which increases the distance by 1.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - After calculating the distances, the program checks if any of the distances are odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins the round. Otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - This logic is based on the fact that in a tree, if the starting node has an odd number of moves available, Ron can always force Hermione into a position where she has no valid move, and vice versa.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the winner of the round based on the calculated distances. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the given tree and starting node. The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem description and the constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
