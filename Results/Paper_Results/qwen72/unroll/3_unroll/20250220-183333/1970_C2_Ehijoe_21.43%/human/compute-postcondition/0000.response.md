Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1. The edges list is still empty. `start` is an integer where 1 <= `start` <= `n`, representing the starting node for the game.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the user input. The input is split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `t` is still 1 as specified in the initial state. The edges list remains empty, and the `start` variable retains its initial condition.
