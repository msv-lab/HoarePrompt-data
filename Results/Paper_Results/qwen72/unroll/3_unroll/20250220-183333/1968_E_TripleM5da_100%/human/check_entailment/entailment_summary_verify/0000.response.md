### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n`, it prints the pair \((i, i)\).

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function prints the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).
   - It does not return any value.

4. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not always provide the optimal solution.
   - Let's verify this with the example provided in the assessment for \(n = 3\):
     - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
       - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
       - Distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
     - Therefore, \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3.
   - The optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) is \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\):
     - Distance between \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 3)\): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - Distance between \((2, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
     - Distance between \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
     - Distance between \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 1)\): \(0\)
     - Distance between \((2, 3)\) and \((2, 3)\): \(0\)
     - Distance between \((3, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(0\)
     - Therefore, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's output for \(n = 3\) does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as it results in a set of size 3, while the optimal solution results in a set of size 4.
   - This confirms that the program does not always provide the optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
