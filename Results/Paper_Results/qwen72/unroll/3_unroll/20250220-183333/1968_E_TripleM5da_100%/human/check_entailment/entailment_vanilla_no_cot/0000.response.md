Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). The program only prints a few specific points and then prints points along the diagonal of the grid, which does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|\} = \{0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]
This set has 5 distinct distances, but the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should have 6 distinct distances, as shown in the problem description.

A correct approach to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) would involve selecting points that cover a wide range of distances. One such approach is to use a combination of points from the corners and the edges of the grid, ensuring that the distances between them are maximized.

For example, a correct solution for \(n = 3\) could be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This arrangement results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 distinct distances, as required.

Therefore, the given program does not always produce the correct output to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
