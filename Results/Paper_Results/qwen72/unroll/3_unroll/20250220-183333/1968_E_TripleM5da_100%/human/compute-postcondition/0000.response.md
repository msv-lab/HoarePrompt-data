To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop head, which in this case is the range defined by `int(input())`.

1. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
3. The state before the loop starts provides information about `t` and `n`, but these are not directly relevant to the loop head. However, they might influence the input value indirectly.

Given the state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- For each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` and `n` are not directly in the loop head, we can assume that the input is related to `n` for each test case.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
