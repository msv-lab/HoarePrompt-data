### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form "? d" returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is "0 0".

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The algorithm uses a set \( vx \) to keep track of the remaining vertices.
   - It repeatedly queries the graph to find and remove vertices with the minimum degree that is at least \( d \), where \( d \) is adjusted based on the number of remaining vertices.
   - The algorithm constructs the Hamiltonian path by appending the removed vertices to the appropriate end of the path.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - \( vx \) is initialized with all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - \( ops \) is an empty list to store the operations (vertices and their non-adjacent vertices).

   - **Query Loop:**
     - While there are more than 2 vertices left in \( vx \):
       - Query the graph with \( d = \text{len}(vx) - 2 \).
       - If the response is "0 0", it means no vertex with the required degree exists. In this case, the algorithm makes another query with \( d = 0 \) to find a vertex with the minimum degree.
       - Remove the vertex \( v1 \) from \( vx \).
       - If \( v2 \) is greater than 0, it means \( v1 \) is not connected to \( v2 \), and the pair \( (v1, v2) \) is added to \( ops \).
       - If \( v2 \) is 0, it means \( v1 \) is connected to all remaining vertices. In this case, another query with \( d = 0 \) is made to find a vertex \( v3 \) with the minimum degree, and the pairs \( (v3, 0) \) and \( (v1, 0) \) are added to \( ops \).

   - **Constructing the Path:**
     - After the loop, \( vx \) contains at most 2 vertices.
     - The algorithm constructs the Hamiltonian path by appending the removed vertices to the appropriate end of the path.
     - The final path is printed in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the graph is reduced to 2 vertices correctly by simply appending them to the path.
   - The algorithm also handles the case where a vertex is connected to all remaining vertices by making an additional query with \( d = 0 \).

5. **Query Limit:**
   - The algorithm ensures that it makes at most \( n \) queries by removing one vertex per query and handling the special case of "0 0" responses efficiently.

### Correctness:
Given the detailed reasoning and the algorithm's ability to handle all edge cases and constraints, the provided program is correct.
