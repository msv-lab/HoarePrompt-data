### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Query Function**:
   - The function `func` initializes a lambda function `q` to handle the interactive queries. It prints a query in the format `"? d"` and reads the response as two integers.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Handling Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the function initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations (vertex pairs) determined by the queries.

3. **Query Loop**:
   - The function enters a loop that continues until there are only 2 vertices left in `vx`.
   - It makes a query with `d = len(vx) - 2` to find a vertex `v1` with a degree at least `d` and a vertex `v2` that is not connected to `v1`.
   - If `v2` is greater than 0, it means `v1` is connected to all other vertices except `v2`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. The pair `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`.
   - If `v2` is 0, it means `v1` is connected to all other vertices, and the function makes another query with `d = 0` to find a vertex `v3` with the minimum degree and a vertex that is not connected to `v3`. `v3` is removed from `vx`, and the pairs `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`.

4. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path**:
   - Once the loop ends, `vx` contains exactly 2 vertices, which are the last two vertices in the Hamiltonian path.
   - The function then iterates over the `ops` list in reverse order to construct the Hamiltonian path. It appends each vertex `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on whether `v1` is connected to the last vertex in `p1`.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the format `! v1 v2 ... vn` by concatenating `p1` and `p2` in reverse order.

5. **Validation**:
   - The function ensures that it makes no more than `n` queries for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the removal of vertices and the construction of the Hamiltonian path based on the queries.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. It makes the necessary queries, processes the responses, and constructs the Hamiltonian path as described. The logic for handling the queries and constructing the path is sound and follows the problem's constraints.

**Correctness: True**
