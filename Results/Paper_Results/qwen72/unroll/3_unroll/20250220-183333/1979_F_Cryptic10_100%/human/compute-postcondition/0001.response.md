The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop depends on the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1. The other states, such as the function `q`, the graph and its properties, `t`, and `n`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
