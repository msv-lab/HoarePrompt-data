Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the interaction with the interactor as specified, making queries to identify and remove vertices to construct a Hamiltonian path. The program ensures that it makes no more than \( n \) queries for each test case and outputs the Hamiltonian path in the required format. The logic for handling the removal of vertices and constructing the path seems to cover all potential cases, including edge cases where the graph has only 2 vertices. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the code, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
