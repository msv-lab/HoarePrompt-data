The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with two integers, `start` and `end`, where `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function is expected to interact with the current directory, which contains subfolders named with digits within the range [start, end], and these subfolders may contain .html files. The function returns a list of all .html files found in the subfolders within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function operates with two integers, `start` and `end`, where `start` <= `end`. It returns a list of all .html files found in the subfolders named with digits within the range [start, end] in the current directory.**
