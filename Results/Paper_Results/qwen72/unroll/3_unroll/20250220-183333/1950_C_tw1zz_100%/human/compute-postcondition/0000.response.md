The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is not defined (it will be defined by the loop), `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
