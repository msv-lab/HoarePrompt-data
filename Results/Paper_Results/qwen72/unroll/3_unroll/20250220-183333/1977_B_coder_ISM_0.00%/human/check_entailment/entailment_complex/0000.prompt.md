Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be the last input integer provided, `t` will remain the same as the initial input integer, and `s` will be a list of characters representing the modified binary form of `x` with a length that may be 30 or 31 depending on the final value of `x` and the operations performed. The list `s` will contain '0', '1', and possibly '-1' characters, and the variable `length` will be the length of the list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string of length 30. It then modifies this binary string according to specific rules: if two consecutive '1's are found, the first '1' is replaced with '-1', and a flag is set. If the flag is set and a '0' is found, the '0' is replaced with '1', and the flag is reset. If the flag is still set after the loop, the last character of the list is modified, and an additional '1' may be appended, increasing the length to 31. The function prints the modified binary string, the length of the modified string, and the final modified string for each test case. The function does not return any value.
