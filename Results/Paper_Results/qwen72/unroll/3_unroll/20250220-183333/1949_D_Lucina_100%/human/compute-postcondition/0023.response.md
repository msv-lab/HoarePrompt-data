Postcondition: **The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the list `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged, and the value of `t` is equal to the length of `sa`. The loop prints a modified version of each row in `xx`, where any '?' character is replaced with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the list `xx` remains unchanged, the list `a` and `b` remain unchanged, the list `sa` remains unchanged, and the list `sb` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters, as well as the indices of rows (and columns) where there are no 'F' characters and no 'S' characters.**
