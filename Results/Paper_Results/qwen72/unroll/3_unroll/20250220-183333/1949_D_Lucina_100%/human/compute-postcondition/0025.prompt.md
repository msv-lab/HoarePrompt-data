You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j. The diagonal characters (i.e., where i = j) are always '.'. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
def func():
    n = int(input())

    b = [0] * (n + 1)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `xx` will contain `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings provided. The list `a` will contain the counts of 'F' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix, and the list `b` will contain the counts of 'S' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged.

    #State: The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the list `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged, and the value of `t` is equal to the length of `sa`.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of n strings, each of length n, containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and returns a modified list where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' to complete the transition video assignments while maintaining the symmetry and the constraints on the number of decided transitions.
