### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob does not.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, so `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (meaning two integers have been picked by Alice and Bob) or if an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, the function returns `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The strategy of counting the occurrences and checking the conditions is correct because:
     - If an integer `i` appears more than once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, but it will still be in `c` after both picks.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, so it will not be in `c` after both picks.
     - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, it will be the MEX of `c` because it is the smallest integer not present in `c`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same correctly.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences, which is efficient.
   - The iteration through the integers from 0 to `N` is also efficient, as it is linear in the size of the input.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
