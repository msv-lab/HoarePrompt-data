You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `t`, `test_cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each integer in the list `a` after the loop has finished executing. The keys in `cnt` will be the unique integers from `a`, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `N` will remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. If no such `i` is found, `t` will be the count of unique integers in `cnt` that appear exactly once, and the loop will return `N + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for Bob, who wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. The program only counts the number of unique elements in the array `a` and returns the smallest integer that is not present or has a count of 1, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts with an empty array `c` and the array `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 2]`.
- Alice can choose `2` (since it appears twice), so `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2]` and `c` becomes `[2]`.
- Bob can choose `0`, so `a` becomes `[1, 2]` and `c` remains `[2]`.
- Alice can choose `1`, so `a` becomes `[2]` and `c` becomes `[2, 1]`.
- Bob can choose `2`, so `a` becomes `[]` and `c` remains `[2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c` is `3` because `0`, `1`, and `2` are present in `c`, but `3` is not. However, the program returns `1` because it incorrectly counts the number of unique elements and does not simulate the game correctly.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
