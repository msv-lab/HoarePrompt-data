To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The variable `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0**
