The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^3`. The function then prints specific pairs of integers for each test case. Specifically, it prints the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. If `n` is 3, it prints the pair `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it prints the pairs `(2, 4)` and then for each integer `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), it prints the pair `(j, j)`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state of the program is that `t` remains unchanged, and the last value of `n` is the input provided for the `t`-th test case.
