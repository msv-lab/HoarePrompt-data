Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints specific pairs of coordinates for each test case based on the value of \(n\).

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the program prints the pairs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these pairs is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the program prints the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these pairs is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

2. **General Case:**
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the program prints the pairs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), followed by \((2, 4)\), and then for each \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), it prints \((j, j)\).
   - The pairs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute the distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
   - The pair \((2, 4)\) contributes additional distances when combined with \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), such as \(|2-1| + |4-1| = 4\) and \(|2-1| + |4-2| = 3\).
   - The pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) contribute distances such as \(|j-1| + |j-1| = 2(j-1)\), \(|j-1| + |j-2| = 2(j-1) - 1\), and \(|j-2| + |j-4| = 2(j-2) - 2\).

However, the program does not seem to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n \geq 4\). The pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will only contribute a few distinct distances, and the overall set \(\mathcal{H}\) will not be maximized. For example, for \(n = 4\), the program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these pairs is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6\}\), which has a size of 5. However, it is possible to achieve a larger set \(\mathcal{H}\) by choosing different pairs of coordinates.

Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n \geq 4\).
