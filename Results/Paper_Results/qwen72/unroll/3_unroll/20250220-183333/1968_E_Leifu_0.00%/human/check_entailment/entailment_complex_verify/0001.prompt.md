You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')

    #State: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n` have been processed as specified in the loop, printing the pairs as described. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the final value of `n` is the last input integer provided for the `t`-th test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^3`. The function then prints specific pairs of integers for each test case. Specifically, it prints the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. If `n` is 3, it prints the pair `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it prints the pairs `(2, 4)` and then for each integer `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), it prints the pair `(j, j)`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state of the program is that `t` remains unchanged, and the last value of `n` is the input provided for the `t`-th test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer \( n \) and need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints the cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 4)\) and then prints cells \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 1, which is the maximum possible for \( n = 2 \).

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is the maximum possible for \( n = 3 \).

   - **For \( n > 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
     - This arrangement does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, consider \( n = 4 \):
       - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
       - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
         - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 4 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \)
         - \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
       - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5, which is not the maximum possible for \( n = 4 \). The maximum possible size is 6, as shown in the problem notes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always produce the correct output for \( n > 3 \). Specifically, it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n = 4 \) and higher values.
