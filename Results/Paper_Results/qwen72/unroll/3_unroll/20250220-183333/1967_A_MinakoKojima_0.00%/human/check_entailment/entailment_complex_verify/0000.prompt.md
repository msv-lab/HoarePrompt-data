You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the value of `ans` is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are no longer in their initial states and have been modified during the loop execution. Specifically, for each test case, `ans` is either the factorial of `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, or it is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the modified list `a`. The list `a` has been updated such that each element is increased by a value that depends on `k` and the minimum value `m` in the list. The value of `k` is reduced during the loop, and `m` is the minimum value of the initial list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and a value `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a result `ans` which is printed for each test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` (where `m` is the minimum value in `a`), `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in a modified list `a`, where each element is adjusted based on `k` and `m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` have been modified and are no longer in their initial states.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the maximum score. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the counts of the cards after buying new ones is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check and Adjustment**:
   ```python
   if k >= n * m:
       ans = math.factorial(n)
   else:
       k -= n * m
   ```
   This part of the code subtracts `n * m` from `k` before checking the condition. However, `n * m` is not a valid adjustment because `m` is the minimum number of cards of any type, and `n * m` would be the total number of cards if each type had at least `m` cards. This is not the correct way to determine how many cards can be bought.

2. **Adjusting Card Counts**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
       k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
   ```
   This part of the code attempts to adjust the counts of the cards, but the logic is incorrect. The expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` does not correctly account for the number of cards that can be bought to maximize the score. It should instead be ensuring that the total number of cards of each type is as close to `m + k // n` as possible, while ensuring that `k` is not overused.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   ```python
   ans = a[0]
   for i in range(1, n):
       ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
   ```
   This part of the code calculates the score by multiplying the differences between consecutive card counts. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the score. The score should be the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current logic does not correctly compute this.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
The expected output is `15`, but the program will not produce this output correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Ensuring that each card type has at least one card.
2. Distributing the remaining coins to maximize the number of permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` in the final arrangement.
3. Calculating the score based on the number of valid permutations.

Given the current implementation, it fails to handle the distribution of coins and the calculation of the score correctly, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
