### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes a string `a` containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace `s` of the string.

2. **Trace Reconstruction**:
   - The function initializes a list `b` of 26 zeros, which will be used to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string `r` being constructed.
   - It then iterates over the trace `s` and for each value `i` in `s`, it finds the index `x` in `b` where the value is `i`.
   - The character at position `x` in `a` is appended to the result string `r`.
   - The value at index `x` in `b` is incremented by 1 to reflect the new occurrence of the character.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the string `r` for each test case, it prints the string `r`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, as it ensures that the trace values are within the valid range (0 ≤ a_i < n).
   - The function also ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, which is handled by the input constraints.

5. **Correctness of Trace Mapping**:
   - The function correctly maps the trace values to the corresponding characters in the alphabet.
   - The use of `b.index(i)` ensures that the first occurrence of a character is mapped to 'a', the second to 'b', and so on, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly reconstruct the string `r` from the given trace `s` for each test case. It handles the input and output as specified and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
