The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s` from standard input. It constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z'), and prints this string to standard output. After processing each test case, the function resets the string `r` and the list `b` (used for mapping) to their initial states. The function does not return any value.
