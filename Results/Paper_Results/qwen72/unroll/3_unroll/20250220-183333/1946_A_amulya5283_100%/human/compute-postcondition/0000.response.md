Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual input processing (reading the number of test cases and the arrays) should be handled within the function. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array elements. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
