Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
