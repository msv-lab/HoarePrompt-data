### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the length `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two lists: `mex` to store the constructed permutation and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current range of values in the permutation.
   - **Constructing the Permutation**:
     - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
       - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a[i] > 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `minn` and `p[i]` must be `minn - a[i]`, which simplifies to `minn` since `a[i]` is positive.
       - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a[i] <= 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `p[i] + a[i]`, and `p[i]` must be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It updates `maxx` if the new value in `mex` exceeds the current `maxx`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - **Correctness of MEX Calculation**:
     - The program correctly calculates the MEX for each prefix of the permutation.
     - For positive `arr[i]`, the MEX is `minn`, and `p[i]` is `minn`.
     - For non-positive `arr[i]`, the MEX is `p[i] + a[i]`, and `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
   - **Uniqueness and Range**:
     - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and cover the range from 0 to `n-1` by incrementing `minn` and updating `maxx` as needed.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The program should handle the case where `n = 1` correctly. For `n = 1`, `a[0]` will be 0, and the only possible permutation is `[0]`.
     - It should handle the case where all elements in `a` are positive or all are negative correctly. The logic for both cases is covered by the conditions in the loop.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1` as it reads input, constructs the permutation, and prints it.
   - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement that requires printing the permutation.

### Final Evaluation:
After reviewing the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
