The given code snippet is a simple `print()` statement without any arguments. Based on the initial state provided:

- `mex`, `minn`, `maxx`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
- The loop only prints the elements of `mex` in the same order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.

However, the code snippet provided does not include the loop that prints the elements of `mex`. Instead, it only contains an empty `print()` statement, which will print a newline character.

Output: **(an empty line)**
