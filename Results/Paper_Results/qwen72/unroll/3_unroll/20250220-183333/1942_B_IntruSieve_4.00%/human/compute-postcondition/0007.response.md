The only object in the loop head is the variable `itm` and the list `mex`. For the loop to execute, `mex` must be a non-empty list. The values of `minn`, `maxx`, `t`, and `test_cases` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`mex` is a list of integers representing the MEX values calculated for each element in `arr` that must have at least 1 integer, `itm` is the first integer in the list, `minn` is the next positive integer that was not included in `mex`, `maxx` is the maximum value that was appended to `mex`, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged**
