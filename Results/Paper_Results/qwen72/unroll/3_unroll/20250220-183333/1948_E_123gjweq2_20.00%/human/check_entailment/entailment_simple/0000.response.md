Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Validation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.
   - The program is expected to print three lines for each test case: the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the clique partition.

2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because it determines the minimum number of segments of length `k` needed to cover `n` vertices.

3. **Array Initialization**:
   - Two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, are initialized to store the vertex assignments and the clique partitions, respectively.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for filling segments of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - It correctly fills the segment from `left` to `right` with values from `small_element` to `big_element` in a specific pattern.
   - The pattern ensures that the values are distinct and that the vertices are partitioned into the correct number of cliques.

5. **Function Call and Loop**:
   - The loop in `func_1` calls `make_array` for each segment of the array, ensuring that the entire array is filled.
   - The loop correctly handles the case where the last segment might be smaller than `k`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the `arr` array, which contains the distinct integers assigned to the vertices.
   - It prints the number of cliques, which is `cliques`.
   - It prints the `cliquess` array, which contains the clique assignments for each vertex.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:
- The `cliquess` array is initialized to all zeros and is not updated correctly in the `make_array` function. This means that the clique assignments are not being stored properly, and the program will always print a sequence of zeros for the clique assignments, which is incorrect.

Given this issue, the program does not correctly partition the graph into cliques and does not provide the correct clique assignments.

Correctness: **False**
