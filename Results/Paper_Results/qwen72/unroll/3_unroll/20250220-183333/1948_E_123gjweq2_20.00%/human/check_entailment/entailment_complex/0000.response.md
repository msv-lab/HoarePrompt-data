### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Clique Calculation**:
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of cliques based on the given condition.
   - **Array Initialization**:
     - Two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to zeros.
   - **Clique Assignment**:
     - The function iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with the appropriate values.
   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array. The `cliquess` array is supposed to indicate the clique each vertex belongs to, but it is initialized to zeros and not updated correctly.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - **Parameter Handling**:
     - The function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - **Element Assignment**:
     - The function calculates `small_element` and `big_element` correctly.
     - It then divides the range `[left, right]` into two halves and fills the first half with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values.
   - **Clique Assignment**:
     - The function correctly assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Clique Assignment**:
  - The `cliquess` array is initialized to zeros and is not updated correctly in `func_1`. This means that the output for the clique assignment will always be a sequence of zeros, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly assign the cliques to the vertices as required by the problem statement. The `cliquess` array should be updated to reflect the correct clique assignments, but it remains a list of zeros.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
