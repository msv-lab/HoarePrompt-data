Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Scope of Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` both use the variables `arr` and `cliquess`, but these variables are not passed as arguments or returned from `make_array`. This means that `make_array` will not modify the `arr` and `cliquess` variables in `func_1` as intended.

2. **Logic of `make_array`**: The logic in `make_array` for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` is flawed. Specifically, the way `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated and used to assign values does not ensure that the vertices will form the correct cliques based on the given condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly. It should print the results for each test case, but the current implementation does not ensure that the output is formatted as required.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k, n), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
    
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    for i in range(left, right):
        arr[i] = i + 1
        cliquess[i] = clique

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `solve`**:
   - Calculates the number of cliques needed.
   - Initializes the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - Calls `make_array` to fill in the values for each clique.
   - Prints the results in the required format.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - Takes `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` as arguments.
   - Assigns the values to `arr` and `cliquess` for the current clique.
   - Ensures that the values in `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n].

3. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n` and `k` and calls the `solve` function.

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.
