### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to store the prefix sums of zeros and ones.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the prefix sums:
     - If the current character is '0', it increments the count of zeros.
     - If the current character is '1', it increments the count of ones.
   - The prefix sums are stored in `S` as pairs `[x, y]`, where `x` is the count of zeros and `y` is the count of ones up to the current house.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to -1, which will store the optimal position of the road.
   - It iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n` inclusive) to place the road.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of zeros (residents who want to live on the left side) on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of ones (residents who want to live on the right side) on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the condition for satisfaction is met:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side should want to live on the left side: `left * 2 >= lsum`.
     - At least half of the residents on the right side should want to live on the right side: `right * 2 >= rsum`.
   - If the condition is met and the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`, it updates `ans` to `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all possible positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct and efficiently computes the number of zeros and ones up to each house.
  - The condition checks are correct and ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
  - The program correctly updates the optimal position `ans` to minimize the distance from the middle of the village.
  - The program handles edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
