The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters but implicitly uses `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within specified ranges, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `m` integers, and `F` is a list of `k` integers. The function calculates the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second largest difference (`next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements in `A`. It then finds the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between a specific range in `A` and elements in `D` adjusted by elements in `F`. Finally, it prints the maximum of this minimum value and `next_max_diff`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged.
