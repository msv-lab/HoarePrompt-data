Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum difference is not reduced by adding any new problem. In such a scenario, the program should return the original maximum difference, but it does not handle this edge case properly. Specifically, the `next_max_diff` variable is used to store the second largest difference, but it is initialized to `-inf` and is not updated correctly if the maximum difference is not reduced by adding any new problem. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 20
5
10
```
Here, the original maximum difference is `10 - 1 = 9`. Adding a problem with complexity `5 + 10 = 15` would not reduce the maximum difference, as the new differences would be `15 - 10 = 5` and `20 - 15 = 5`, both of which are smaller than the original maximum difference. However, the program would incorrectly return `5` instead of `9`.
