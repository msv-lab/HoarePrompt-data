The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`test_cases` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list**
