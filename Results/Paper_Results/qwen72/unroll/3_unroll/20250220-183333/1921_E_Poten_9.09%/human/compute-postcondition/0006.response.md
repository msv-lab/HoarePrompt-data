The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears to accept a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. The parameters `h` and `w` represent the height and width of a grid, respectively, with `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9`. It is guaranteed that either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b`, meaning the points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are distinct. The function is expected to handle up to `10^4` test cases, and the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.

Given these constraints, the function likely returns a result for each test case based on the positions of the points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within the grid defined by `h` and `w`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the positions of the points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within a grid of height `h` and width `w`.**
