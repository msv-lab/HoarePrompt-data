Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given query range is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

For the query `(1, 3)`, the program should output `1 3` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`, which are different. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`, indicating that it fails to find a valid pair of indices within the specified range. This is due to the incorrect handling of the `bisect_left` function and the logic that follows it.
