Output State: **The variable `N` remains unchanged. The list `nums` remains unchanged. The variable `s` is equal to `N`. The variable `e` remains unchanged. The variable `num` is equal to `-1`. The list `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + start_index, end_index, value)` for each contiguous segment of the same value in `nums`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the segment, `end_index` is the index just after the segment, and `value` is the value of the segment.**
