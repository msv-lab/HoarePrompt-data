### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases, which is a common technique to avoid index out of bounds errors.

2. **Array Compression**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and compresses it into a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple represents a segment of the array with the same value.
   - Each tuple in `arr` contains `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of the segment, and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - This compression helps in efficiently handling the queries by reducing the number of elements to check.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query start index `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if there is a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists.

5. **Debugging Statements**:
   - The program includes some debugging statements that print the array and query details if `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`. These statements are not part of the actual logic and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop for each test case, but the function itself reads input, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly managed.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.readline` inside `func_1` can cause issues if the input is not read in the correct order.
   - The program does not handle the case where the segment ends exactly at `r` and the next segment does not exist.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Management**: The program reads input inside `func_1`, which can cause issues if the input is not read in the correct order. This is a significant flaw.
- **Segment Handling**: The program correctly compresses the array and uses binary search to find segments, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the segment ends exactly at `r`.
- **Output**: The program does not always produce the correct output for all queries due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with input management and handling edge cases, which can lead to incorrect results for some queries.
