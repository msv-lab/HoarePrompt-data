The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` and a series of queries `q`. For each query `[l, r]`, it identifies the boundaries of the contiguous segments in `nums` that contain the same value and returns a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of the segment containing the queried range. If the queried range does not fit within any segment, it returns `(-1, -1)`. The function handles multiple test cases, where each test case includes a list `nums` and a set of queries `q`. The input list `nums` and the number of elements `N` remain unchanged throughout the function execution. The function does not return a sum of elements but rather the boundaries of segments.
