### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.

2. **Logic for Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is true), the program needs to consider the cost of buying one extra yogurt at the regular price.
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` because buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.
     - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`, which means buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Logic for Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2` is false), the program only needs to consider the cost of buying pairs of yogurts.
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` because buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.
     - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (an odd number), ensuring that the single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 2 (an even number), ensuring that the pair is bought at the cheaper of the two prices (`a * 2` or `b`).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `2 * 5` (10) is less than `9`, so the output is `10`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `3 % 2` is true, so it checks `2 * 5` (10) is less than `9`.
     - Since `10` is not less than `9`, the output is `1 * 9 + 5` (14).
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `3 % 2` is true, so it checks `2 * 5` (10) is less than `11`.
     - Since `10` is less than `11`, the output is `15` (3 * 5).
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `4 % 2` is false, so it checks `2 * 5` (10) is less than `11`.
     - Since `10` is less than `11`, the output is `20` (4 * 5).

The program's logic and output match the problem description and the provided examples.
