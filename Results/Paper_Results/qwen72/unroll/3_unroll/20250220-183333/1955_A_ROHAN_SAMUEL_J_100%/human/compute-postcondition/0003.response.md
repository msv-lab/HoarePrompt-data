Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the function. **
