### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buying one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`). The total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - **Condition:** `if n % 2:`
    - This correctly identifies if `n` is odd.
  - **Sub-Condition:** `if 2 * a < b:`
    - If buying two yogurts individually is cheaper, the program prints `a * n`.
    - **Correctness:** This is correct because if `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is indeed cheaper.
  - **Sub-Condition:** `else:`
    - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper or equal, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
    - **Correctness:** This is correct because `n // 2` pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price, and the remaining one yogurt is bought at the regular price.

- **Even Number of Yogurts:**
  - **Condition:** `elif 2 * a < b:`
    - If buying two yogurts individually is cheaper, the program prints `a * n`.
    - **Correctness:** This is correct because if `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is indeed cheaper.
  - **Condition:** `else:`
    - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper or equal, the program prints `n // 2 * b`.
    - **Correctness:** This is correct because all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotion price.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case `n = 1`:**
  - The program will print `a * 1` because `n` is odd and `2 * a` is always greater than `b` for `n = 1`.
  - **Correctness:** This is correct because the only way to buy one yogurt is at the regular price.
- **Case `n = 2`:**
  - The program will print `min(2 * a, b)`.
  - **Correctness:** This is correct because it compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually versus the promotion price.
- **Case `n = 3`:**
  - The program will print `min(3 * a, b + a)`.
  - **Correctness:** This is correct because it buys one pair at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price if the promotion is cheaper.
- **Case `n = 4`:**
  - The program will print `min(4 * a, 2 * b)`.
  - **Correctness:** This is correct because it buys two pairs at the promotion price if the promotion is cheaper.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
