You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buying one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`). The total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling odd and even numbers of yogurts is correct.
- The program correctly checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price.
- The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even numbers of yogurts.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly (it will always buy one yogurt at the regular price).
- The program handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly (it will compare the cost of buying two yogurts individually versus the promotion price).
- The program handles larger values of `n` correctly by breaking down the problem into pairs and handling the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
