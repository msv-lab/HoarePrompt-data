You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting the first line to contain two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the next line to populate an array `a` of length `n + 1` (with an extra 0 at the beginning). The function computes a new array `b` of the same length, where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1. The function then computes the cumulative sum of the original array `a` and prints it. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference in cumulative sums of `a` and `b` between indices `x` and `y` is less than zero or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good. Specifically, the logic used to construct the `b` array and the condition to check if the subarray is good are flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
[0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 13]
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

The program prints the `a` array, which is not required by the problem description. More importantly, the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is incorrect. For example, for the subarray `c[1:5]` which is `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`, the program incorrectly prints `NO` instead of `YES`.

The correct approach should involve checking if the sum of the subarray can be split into two different arrays `a` and `b` such that the conditions are met. The current logic does not handle this correctly.
