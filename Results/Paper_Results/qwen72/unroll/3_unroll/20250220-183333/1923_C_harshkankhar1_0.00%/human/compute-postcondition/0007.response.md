The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `q`. The loop will execute based on the value of `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` remains the same input integer, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`, `c` remains the same list, each query `l_i` and `r_i` remains the same**
