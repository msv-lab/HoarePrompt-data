Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 500`. After processing each test case, the function prints the sum of certain values and the value of `n + r`, where `r` is determined based on the relationship between `n` and `i`. Additionally, it prints a series of lines, each containing a sequence of numbers based on the value of `n + r`. The function does not return any value; it only performs these print operations. The state of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function execution. **
