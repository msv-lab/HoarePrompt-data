### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either assigning a permutation to a row or a column.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the maximum sum is 1, and only one operation is needed to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Function:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the matrix size `n`.
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` and updates `sum` and `r` based on the condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic for updating `sum` and `r` is:
     - If \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i \times n \), then \( r = i \) and \( \text{sum} += \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
     - Otherwise, \( \text{sum} += i \times n \).
   - This logic is intended to maximize the sum, but it does not correctly handle the case when \( n = 1 \).

4. **Specific Case Analysis:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - The loop runs once with \( i = 1 \).
     - The condition \( \frac{1(1+1)}{2} > 1 \times 1 \) is false.
     - Therefore, \( \text{sum} += 1 \times 1 = 1 \) and \( r = 0 \).
     - The function prints \( \text{sum} = 1 \) and \( n + r = 1 + 0 = 1 \).
     - It then prints one operation: `1 1 1`.
   - This is correct for the sum and the number of operations for \( n = 1 \).

5. **General Case Analysis:**
   - For \( n > 1 \):
     - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n \).
     - The condition \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i \times n \) is true for \( i = 1 \) and false for \( i > 1 \).
     - Therefore, \( r = 1 \) and \( \text{sum} \) is calculated as \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n-1) \times n \).
     - The function prints \( \text{sum} \) and \( n + r \).
     - It then prints \( n + r \) operations, where the first \( n \) operations are of type 1 and the next \( r \) operations are of type 2.
   - This logic is intended to maximize the sum, but it does not necessarily follow the optimal strategy described in the problem.

6. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy is to use the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for both rows and columns.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of each row and column is maximized.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the optimal sum is 1, and one operation is sufficient.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the optimal sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and \( 2n \) operations are sufficient.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect in stating that the program outputs more operations than necessary for \( n = 1 \).
   - The program correctly outputs the sum and the number of operations for \( n = 1 \).
   - However, the logic for \( n > 1 \) is not optimal and may not always produce the correct number of operations or the correct sum.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program is correct for the specific case \( n = 1 \), but it may not be correct for \( n > 1 \) due to the non-optimal logic.
- Given the problem constraints and the need for an optimal solution, the program's logic for \( n > 1 \) needs to be revised.

Final: **False**
