Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` from the user. After each iteration, the variables `sum` and `r` will be reset to 0, and the loop will print the final values of `sum` and `n + r`. Additionally, it will print a series of lines based on the value of `n + r`. The state of `t` will remain unchanged, and the loop will continue to execute until all `t` test cases have been processed.**
