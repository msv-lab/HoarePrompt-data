### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the maximum possible sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Operation Strategy:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - Alternatively, we can perform \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The program should output the maximum sum and the operations required to achieve it.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on a condition:
     - If \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) (sum of the permutation) is greater than \( i \times n \), it adds \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to \( \text{sum} \) and sets \( r \) to \( i \).
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to \( \text{sum} \).
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum. The maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and the number of operations should be \( n \) (or \( 2n \) if both row and column operations are used).
   - The program's logic for determining \( r \) and the sum is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The program prints the calculated sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it performs Type 1 operations on each row.
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it performs Type 2 operations on each column.
   - The logic for \( r \) and the sum is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is incorrect.
   - The sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) and the number of operations should be \( n \) (or \( 2n \) if both row and column operations are used).
   - The program's logic for determining \( r \) and the sum is flawed and does not follow the problem's specifications.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations required to achieve it. The logic for determining the sum and the operations is incorrect and does not follow the problem's specifications.

Final: **False**
