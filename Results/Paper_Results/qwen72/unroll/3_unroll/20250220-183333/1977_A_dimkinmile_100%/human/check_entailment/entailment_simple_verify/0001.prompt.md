You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n` and `m` as described in the problem, so the correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, m):` where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *`n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Explanation of the Logic**:
   - **Even Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being even is crucial because each move can either add or remove one cube. If the difference is even, it means that the number of "add" moves and "remove" moves can be balanced to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` after `n` moves.
   - **Non-negative Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being non-negative ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary to build a tower of height `m`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `3 3`, `n - m = 0` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - For the test case `2 4`, `n - m = -2` which is not non-negative. Hence, the answer is "No".
   - For the test case `5 3`, `n - m = 2` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions checked in the program are valid and align with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
