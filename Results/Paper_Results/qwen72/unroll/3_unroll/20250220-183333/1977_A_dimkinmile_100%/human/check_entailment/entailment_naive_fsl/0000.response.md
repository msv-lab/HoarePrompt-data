Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `n >= m` because if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is always possible to build a tower of `m` cubes by simply adding cubes in `m` moves and then removing or adding cubes in the remaining `n - m` moves to balance out the total number of moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 1`. According to the problem description, it is possible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves by adding a cube and then removing it. However, the given program would output "No" because `(2 - 1) % 2 == 1` and `2 - 1 >= 0` is true, but the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` fails. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
