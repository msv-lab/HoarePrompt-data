### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Explanation of the Logic**:
   - **Even Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being even is crucial because each move can either add or remove one cube. If the difference is even, it means that the number of "add" moves and "remove" moves can be balanced to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` after `n` moves.
   - **Non-negative Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being non-negative ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary to build a tower of height `m`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `3 3`, `n - m = 0` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - For the test case `2 4`, `n - m = -2` which is not non-negative. Hence, the answer is "No".
   - For the test case `5 3`, `n - m = 2` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions checked in the program are valid and align with the problem description.

### Correctness:
