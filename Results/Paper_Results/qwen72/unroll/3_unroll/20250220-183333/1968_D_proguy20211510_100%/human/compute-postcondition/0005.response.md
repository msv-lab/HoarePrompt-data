The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts several parameters for each test case: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the permutation), `k` (the duration of the game), `P_B` and `P_S` (the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), `p` (a permutation of length `n` consisting of distinct integers from 1 to `n`), and `a` (an array of length `n` where each element `a_i` is a positive integer). The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case based on the provided parameters. The exact return value is not specified in the constraints, but it is implied that the function will return a result that indicates the outcome of the game for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, based on the given parameters.**
