Output State: **The loop executes all iterations, and for each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are updated within the loop, but their final values after the loop are not explicitly defined in the output state. The loop itself does not modify the values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, or `alpha`.**
