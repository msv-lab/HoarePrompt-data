Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. According to the problem description, if both players start at the same position and follow the same rules, they should have the same score after k turns, resulting in a "Draw". However, the program does not account for this scenario and may incorrectly determine a winner.

Example Input:
```
1
4 2 1 1
2 3 4 1
5 1 3 2 4
```
Expected Output:
```
Draw
```
Actual Output:
The program will incorrectly output either "Bodya" or "Sasha" because it does not handle the case where both players start at the same position and thus should always end up with the same score.
