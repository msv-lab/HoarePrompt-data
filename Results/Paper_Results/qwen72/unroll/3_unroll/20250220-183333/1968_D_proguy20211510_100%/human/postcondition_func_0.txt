The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements through a permutation `p` and the values in array `a`. The function then prints the result of the game for each test case, which can be 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on which player has the higher score or if they have the same score. The function does not return any values, and it does not modify the global variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, or `alpha`.
