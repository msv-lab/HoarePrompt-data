### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.
   - It starts from `pb` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Bodya, stopping when it encounters a previously visited position.
   - Similarly, it starts from `ps` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Sasha, stopping when it encounters a previously visited position.
   - This part of the program is correct and effectively finds the cycle for each player's starting position.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through their respective paths.
   - For each position in the path, it calculates the potential score if the player stays at that position for the remaining turns.
   - However, the logic for calculating the score is incorrect. The program assumes that the player can stay at a position for multiple turns, which is not how the game is described. The player can either stay or move to `p_x` on each turn.
   - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the score and the current position for each player.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `MOD` are defined but not used in the program. These can be removed to clean up the code.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic is incorrect. The current implementation assumes that the player can stay at a position for multiple turns, which is not how the game is described.
   - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the score and the current position for each player.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start, k):
            score = 0
            pos = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[pos - 1]
                pos = p[pos - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb, k)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps, k)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Simulation Function:**
   - The `simulate_game` function simulates the game for a given starting position and number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It iterates `k` times, adding the score at the current position and moving to the next position according to the permutation `p`.

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - The program calls the `simulate_game` function for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It then compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Final Evaluation:

The original program's score calculation logic is incorrect, and it does not simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The corrected program accurately simulates the game and determines the winner correctly.

Final: **False**
