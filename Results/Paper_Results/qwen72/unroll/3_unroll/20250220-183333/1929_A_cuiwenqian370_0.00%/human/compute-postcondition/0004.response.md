To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition in the loop head: `left <= right`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

Let's analyze the condition `left <= right`:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 100, `n - 1` will always be greater than or equal to 1, which means `right` will always be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the condition `left <= right` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop, given the provided constraints.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
