### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` which is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` which is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - It then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` is already in `residue_map`. If it is, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful are:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The program correctly uses the residues to check these conditions. The key idea is that if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\), then \((a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) = 0 \mod x\). Similarly, if \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), then \((a_i \mod y) - (a_j \mod y) = 0 \mod y\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the array `arr` can have up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) elements and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - It also handles the constraints on `x` and `y` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The use of residues and the dictionary `residue_map` ensures that the conditions are checked efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
