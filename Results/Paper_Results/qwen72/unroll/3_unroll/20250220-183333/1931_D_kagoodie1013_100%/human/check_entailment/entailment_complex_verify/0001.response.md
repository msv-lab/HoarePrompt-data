### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.
   - This initialization is correct and necessary for the algorithm to work.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates two residues:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. However, the calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `r_y = -num % y` to ensure that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Updating Residue Map**:
   - The program calculates the current key as `(num % x, num % y)` and updates the `residue_map` with this key, incrementing its count.
   - This part of the code is correct in terms of updating the residue map, but it uses the incorrect residue for `r_y`.

5. **Counting**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.
   - However, due to the incorrect calculation of `r_y`, the program may not count all valid pairs.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. This is crucial for handling large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array has only two elements correctly.
   - It also handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs correctly by initializing `count` to zero and not incrementing it if no valid pairs are found.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error in the calculation of the residue `r_y`. The correct calculation should be `r_y = -num % y` to ensure that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This error affects the correctness of the program, as it may not count all valid beautiful pairs.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
