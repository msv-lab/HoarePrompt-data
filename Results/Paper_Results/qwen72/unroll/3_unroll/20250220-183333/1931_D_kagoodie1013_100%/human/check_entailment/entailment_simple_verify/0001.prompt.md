You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns the list `results` which contains the number of pairs `(i, j)` for each test case, where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a_i + a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The other variables (`test_cases`) remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates two residues:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - The program then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such tuples to the `count` variable.

4. **Updating Residue Map**:
   - The program calculates the current key as `(num % x, num % y)` and updates the `residue_map` with this key, incrementing its count.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Residue Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

- **Correctness of Counting**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of pairs \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. This is crucial for handling large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where the array has only two elements correctly.
  - It also handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs correctly by initializing `count` to zero and not incrementing it if no valid pairs are found.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
