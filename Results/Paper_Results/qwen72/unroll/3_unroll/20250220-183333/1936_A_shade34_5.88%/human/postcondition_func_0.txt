The function operates in an interactive environment to determine the maximum XOR of any two elements in a fixed permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each input `n`, the function makes a series of queries to identify the indices of the two elements that achieve this maximum XOR and prints these indices. After processing all inputs, the final state of the program includes the variables `mak` and `mak2` holding the indices of the elements that achieve the maximum XOR for the last input `n`, and the list `pans` containing the indices of the elements that are equal to `mak2` in the last permutation. All other variables will be in their final state as determined by the last iteration of the loop.
