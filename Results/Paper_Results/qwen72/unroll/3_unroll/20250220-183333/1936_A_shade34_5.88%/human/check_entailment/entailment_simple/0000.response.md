### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? \ a \ b \ c \ d \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function starts by iterating over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `mak` to 0, which will be used to store the index of the element that is part of the maximum XOR pair.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find the index `mak` such that \( p_{mak} \) is the largest element in the permutation. This is done by comparing \( p_{mak} \mid p_{mak} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \). If \( p_i \) is larger, `mak` is updated to \( i \).
   - Next, it initializes `mak2` to `mak` and creates an empty list `pans` to store indices that are equal to `mak2` in terms of the bitwise OR comparison.
   - It iterates over all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) to find the second index `mak2` such that \( p_{mak} \oplus p_{mak2} \) is maximized. This is done by comparing \( p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2} \) with \( p_i \mid p_{mak2} \). If \( p_i \) is smaller, `mak` is updated to \( i \) and `pans` is reset to contain only \( i \). If \( p_i \) is equal, \( i \) is appended to `pans`.
   - After finding the potential candidates for the second index, it iterates over the list `pans` to find the final `mak` that maximizes \( p_{mak2} \oplus p_{mak} \).
   - Finally, it prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the answer.

3. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n \) queries.
   - The third loop makes \( \text{len}(pans) - 1 \) queries, where \( \text{len}(pans) \) is at most \( n \).
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len}(pans) - 1) \le 3n \), which satisfies the problem constraints.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the largest element in the permutation and then finds the second element that maximizes the XOR with the largest element.
   - The use of bitwise OR comparisons helps in narrowing down the potential candidates for the second element.
   - The final step ensures that the maximum XOR is found by comparing the candidates.
