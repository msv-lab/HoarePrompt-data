The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an interactive environment to find the maximum XOR of any two elements in a fixed permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this. After executing the function, it returns the maximum XOR value found.
