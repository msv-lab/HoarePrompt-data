The function `func` processes a series of cases, where each case involves calculating the minimum cost to move an element from a specified starting position (`na_frente`) to a specified ending position (`pos_final`) using two lists of costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`). For each case, the function reads the input values, computes the minimum cost, and prints this cost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all input values have been processed and the minimum costs for each case have been printed.
