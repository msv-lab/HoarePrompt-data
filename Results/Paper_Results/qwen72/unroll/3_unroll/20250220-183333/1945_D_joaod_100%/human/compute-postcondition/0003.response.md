The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a_i`: A list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i`: A list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output section. However, given the context, it can be inferred that the function is likely to return some result based on the processing of the lists `a_i` and `b_i` with respect to the integers `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed.**
