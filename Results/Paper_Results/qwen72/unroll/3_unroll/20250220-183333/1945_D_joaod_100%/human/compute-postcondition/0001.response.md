The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. Since `c` is the loop index, it starts at 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
