Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and incrementing. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string is the decoded version of `encoded` based on this mapping. **
