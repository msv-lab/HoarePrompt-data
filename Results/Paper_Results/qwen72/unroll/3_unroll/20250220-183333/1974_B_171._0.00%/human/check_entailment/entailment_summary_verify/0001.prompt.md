You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and incrementing. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string is the decoded version of `encoded` based on this mapping.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Understanding the Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We need to determine the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to decode the string.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the character mappings.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to `decoded`.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it iterates over all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a character that is not already in the `mapping` values.
     - It then adds this character to the `mapping` with the current encoded character as the value and appends the found character to `decoded`.

5. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The decoding logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function is trying to map each character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase letter that has not been used yet, which does not follow the symmetric replacement rule of the encoding process.
   - The correct approach should be to:
     - Construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
     - Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

6. **Correct Decoding Logic:**
   - Construct `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
   - Create a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - Use this mapping to replace each character in `b` to get the original string `s`.

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program will not produce the correct decoded string.
