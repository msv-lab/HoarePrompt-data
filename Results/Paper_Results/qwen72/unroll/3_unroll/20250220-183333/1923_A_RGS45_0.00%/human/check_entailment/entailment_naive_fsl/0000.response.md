Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the ribbon has chips and free cells in such a way that moving chips to form a single block requires more than one operation. For example, consider the input where the ribbon is represented as `1 0 0 1 0 1`. The expected output should be `2` because you need to move the first chip to the second position and the third chip to the fourth position to form a single block. However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is incorrect.
