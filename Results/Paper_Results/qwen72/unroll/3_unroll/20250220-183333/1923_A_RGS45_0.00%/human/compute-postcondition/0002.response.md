Output State: **The loop will process `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon represented by the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will be updated for each iteration, but their values will be determined by the input for each test case. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will be recalculated for each test case based on the input `arr`. After all iterations, the initial state of `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have printed the count of free cells for each test case.**
