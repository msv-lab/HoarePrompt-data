Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of cells `n` and the ribbon state `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip. This is a correct approach because `find('1')` returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', and `arr[::-1].find('1')` returns the index of the last occurrence of '1' when the string is reversed.

3. **Extracting the Substring**: The function then extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`. This is a correct approach because `x` is the index of the first chip, and `n - y` is the index of the last chip (since `y` is the distance from the end to the last chip).

4. **Counting Free Cells**: The function counts the number of free cells (0s) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`. This is the correct approach because the number of free cells between the first and last chip is the number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

5. **Output**: The function prints the count of free cells for each test case, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

However, there is a potential issue with the input handling:
- The input `arr` is read as a string, but it should be a list of integers. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly converted to a list of integers.

To fix this, the input `arr` should be converted to a list of integers before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        
        x = arr.index(1)
        
        y = n - arr[::-1].index(1) - 1
        
        z = arr[x:y + 1]
        
        print(z.count(0))
```

Given the original program, the input handling is incorrect, which would lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the original program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
