You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different values of n and p, as specified by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The function either prints 2 and returns immediately, or it completes the loop without printing anything. The values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: If `n` is 2, the function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function is called multiple times with different values of `n` and `p`, as specified by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. `n` is an input integer and has a current value of 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as integers provided by the input. If `n` is not 2, the function either prints 2 and returns immediately, or it completes the loop without printing anything. The values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from the input. It then checks if the best friend relationships represented by `p` form a valid cycle of length 3. If `n` is 2, it prints 2 and returns. If `n` is greater than 2 and a valid cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 2 and returns. If no valid cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 3 and returns. The function does not modify the input values `n` and `p`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 (to make the list 1-indexed).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If `n` is 2, the program correctly prints 2 and returns. This is because if there are only 2 friends, Monocarp must invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **General Case for `n > 2`:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3, where each friend in the cycle is the best friend of another friend in the cycle.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is because inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure that both of them come to the party, as each of them has an invitation and their best friend also has an invitation.
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints 3. This is because the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3, as there are no cycles of length 3, and inviting 3 friends will ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is used to detect cycles of length 3. This is a valid approach because it checks if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, which is a characteristic of a cycle of length 3.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly.
   - For `n > 2`, the program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 and prints 2 if such a cycle is found. If no cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 3, which is the correct minimum number of invitations needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by identifying cycles of length 3 and handling the special case where `n == 2`. It ensures that the minimum number of invitations is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
