### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which skips the first line (the number of test cases) and processes the remaining lines.
   - Each line is split into three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Conditions for Winning:**
   - The function checks if `x` (the maximum number of consecutive losses) is less than `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can win if he has at least `x + 1` coins initially (`a >= x + 1`).
   - If `x` equals `k - 1`:
     - Sasha can win if he has at least `x + 2` coins initially (`a >= x + 2`).
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
     - The function calculates a value `z` using a loop. The loop runs `x - k + 3` times, and in each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - Sasha can win if he has at least `z` coins initially (`a >= z`).

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The conditions `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` are straightforward and based on the problem's constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`, the value of `z` is calculated to determine the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win. The loop is designed to simulate the process of increasing the bet size after a series of losses, which is a valid strategy to ensure that Sasha can recover his losses and still have a positive number of coins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly:
     - If `a` is less than the required number of coins for the given `k` and `x`, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to the required number of coins, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the given constraints. The conditions and the loop for calculating `z` are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
