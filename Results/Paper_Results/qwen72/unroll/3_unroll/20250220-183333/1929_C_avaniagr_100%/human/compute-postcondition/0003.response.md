Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines and prints 'YES' if the value of `a` meets certain conditions based on `k` and `x`, and 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are as follows: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` must be at least `x + 1`; if `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` must be at least `x + 2`; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `a` must be at least a calculated value `z`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
