The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
