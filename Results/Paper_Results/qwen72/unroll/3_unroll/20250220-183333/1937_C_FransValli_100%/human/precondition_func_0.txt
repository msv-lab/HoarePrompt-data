The function operates in an interactive environment with multiple test cases. Each test case involves a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can query the comparison of bitwise OR results of four chosen indices (a, b, c, d) within the permutation, and must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
