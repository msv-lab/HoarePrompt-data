Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop for Test Cases**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the size of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value (`maxi`)**: The function initializes `maxi` to 0. It then iterates from 1 to n-1, querying the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_maxi)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`. This step ensures that `maxi` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p`.

3. **Finding Indices with the Same Maximum OR Value**: The function initializes an array `arr` with the index 0. It then iterates from 1 to n-1, querying the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_0)` with `(p_maxi | p_i)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`. This step ensures that `arr` contains all indices `i` such that `p_maxi | p_i` is equal to `p_maxi | p_0`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Value (`mini`)**: The function initializes `mini` to the first index in `arr`. It then iterates over the remaining indices in `arr`, querying the comparison of `(p_mini | p_mini)` with `(p_item | p_item)`. If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`. This step ensures that `mini` is the index of the minimum value among the indices in `arr`.

5. **Outputting the Result**: Finally, the function prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Query Usage**: The function uses at most `n-1` queries to find `maxi`, another `n-1` queries to find all indices with the same maximum OR value, and up to `n-1` queries to find `mini` among these indices. This totals to `3n - 3` queries, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices `i` such that `p_maxi | p_i` is equal to `p_maxi | p_0`.
  - The third loop correctly identifies the index `mini` of the minimum value among the indices in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and uses the queries efficiently to find the required indices. The logic is sound and the number of queries does not exceed the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
