The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is designed to work with multiple test cases, each involving a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can query the comparison of bitwise OR results of four chosen indices (a, b, c, d) within the permutation. The goal of the function is to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
