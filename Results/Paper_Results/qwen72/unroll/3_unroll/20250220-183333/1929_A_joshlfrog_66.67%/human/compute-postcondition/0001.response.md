The only variables in the loop head are `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and `e` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `e` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `e` is 0**
