Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (2 ≤ l ≤ 100) indicating the length of the list, followed by a list of `l` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each list. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed `t` lines, each containing the difference for the corresponding list. The function does not return any value. **
