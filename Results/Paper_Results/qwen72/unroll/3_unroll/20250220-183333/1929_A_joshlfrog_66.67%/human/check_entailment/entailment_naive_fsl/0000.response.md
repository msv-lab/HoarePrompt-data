Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and rearranging the elements to maximize this sum requires a different strategy.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be 6, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2]. However, the given program will output 3, which is incorrect.
