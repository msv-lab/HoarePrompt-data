Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The provided program simply finds the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, Sasha should sort the array in ascending order. The beauty of the array is then the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

So, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Alternatively, you can simplify the calculation:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] - nums[0])
```

### Example:
For the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```

The output should be:
```
2
0
57
1
1
```

The corrected program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and then computing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.
