You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The function will print the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list in the input. The variables `x` and `y` will be reset to 0 and 100000000 respectively for each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, the function will have printed `t` lines, each containing the difference for the corresponding list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this sum.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - To maximize the sum \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), we need to maximize each individual difference \(a_i - a_{i-1}\).
   - The maximum difference \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the largest element is followed by the smallest element, and so on.
   - However, the problem can be simplified by realizing that the maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The given program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the array elements \(nums\).
   - It then initializes two variables \(x\) and \(y\) to track the maximum and minimum elements of the array, respectively.
   - The program iterates through the array to update \(x\) and \(y\) with the maximum and minimum elements.
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not sort the array or calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Instead, it only finds the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference.
   - The difference \(x - y\) is not the correct way to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements by rearranging the array.

Correctness: **False**
