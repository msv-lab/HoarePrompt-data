The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state `data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`, and `idx` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data` and must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1, `_` is 0**
