The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of length `n`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs `(a_i, a_j)` in `arr` such that `(a_i + a_j)` is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The input `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
