Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it parses `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It constructs the `test_cases` list with the correct format and passes it to `func_1`.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `ry = a % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) is already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((a % x, a % y)\).
   - Finally, it appends the count to the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` is the negative remainder of `a` when divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative, and `ry` is the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.
   - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that we count pairs \((a_i, a_j)\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when the array is empty or contains only one element (in these cases, the count of beautiful pairs will be 0).

4. **Output:**
   - The function `func_2` prints the results for each test case, which matches the problem statement's requirement.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case and handles the input and output as specified.

Final: **True**
