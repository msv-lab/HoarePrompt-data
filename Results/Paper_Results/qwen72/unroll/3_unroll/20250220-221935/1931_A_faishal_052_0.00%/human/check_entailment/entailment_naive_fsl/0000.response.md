Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the encoding of the word to find the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array `arr` and the subsequent sorting of `arr` can lead to incorrect results. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
48
```

**Expected Output:**
```
auz
```

**Actual Output:**
```
azz
```

**Explanation:**
- The program processes the input `48` and constructs the array `arr` as follows:
  - First iteration: `lex = 48`, `arr = [26]`, `lex = 22`
  - Second iteration: `lex = 22`, `arr = [26, 26]`, `lex = -4`
  - Third iteration: `lex = -4`, `arr = [26, 26, -4]`
- After sorting `arr`, it becomes `[-4, 26, 26]`.
- The program then prints `azz` (which corresponds to `[-4, 26, 26]`).

However, the correct lexicographically smallest word for the input `48` is `auz` (which corresponds to `[1, 21, 26]`).

The program fails to correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after subtracting the maximum possible values (26) from `lex`. It should ensure that the smallest possible values are used to construct the word, and the values should be distributed in a way that maintains the lexicographical order.
