Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually by reading the encoded value `lex`.

2. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters that will form the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value `lex` into three positions by iterating over a loop twice (for the first two positions).
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex` and subtract that value from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the smallest possible value.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the positions are in ascending order.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters by converting the positions to ASCII values (using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`).

5. **Issues**:
   - The decoding logic is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of the values to form the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The program should prioritize assigning the smallest possible values to the first two positions and then the remaining value to the third position.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To form the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
     - Assign the smallest possible value (1) to the first position.
     - Assign the smallest possible value to the second position, ensuring the sum of the first two positions does not exceed `lex`.
     - Assign the remaining value to the third position.

Given the issues in the decoding logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
