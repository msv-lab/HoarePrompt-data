To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer input representing the encoded value of a three-letter word.
- `cases` is an integer input representing the number of test cases.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop:**
   - The loop runs `cases` times.
   - For each iteration, it initializes an empty list `arr`.

2. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop runs 2 times.
   - It checks the value of `lex` and appends a value to `arr` based on the conditions:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 and decrements `lex` by 26.

3. **After Inner Loop:**
   - It appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - It prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` (converted to ASCII values by adding 96) in a single line.

### Example Execution:
Let's assume `cases = 1` and `lex = 53` (for simplicity, we will consider one test case).

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `arr = []`
   - `lex = 53`
   - **First Inner Loop:**
     - `lex <= 26` is false.
     - `lex < 52` is false.
     - `arr.append(26)`, `lex = 53 - 26 = 27`
   - **Second Inner Loop:**
     - `lex <= 26` is false.
     - `lex < 52` is true.
     - `arr.append(26)`, `lex = 27 - 26 = 1`
   - **After Inner Loop:**
     - `arr.append(1)`, `arr = [26, 26, 1]`
     - `arr.sort()`, `arr = [1, 26, 26]`
   - **Print Statement:**
     - `print(chr(1 + 96), chr(26 + 96), chr(26 + 96))` which prints `a z z`.

### General Output:
The loop will print three characters for each test case based on the values in `arr` after sorting. The characters are determined by the values in `arr` plus 96, which converts the values to their corresponding lowercase letters.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations of the loop, the output will be a series of three-character strings, one for each test case, where each character is determined by the sorted values in `arr` plus 96.

Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints a three-character string where each character is determined by the sorted values in `arr` plus 96.**
