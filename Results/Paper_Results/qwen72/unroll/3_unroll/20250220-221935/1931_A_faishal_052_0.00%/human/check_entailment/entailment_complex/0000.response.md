### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded value (`lex`).

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters of the word.
   - The logic inside the loop attempts to determine the largest possible value for the first two letters by subtracting 26 from `lex` and appending 26 to `arr` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr` as the third letter.

3. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The function sorts the `arr` list to ensure that the letters are in the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding character by adding 96 (since 'a' is at position 1, and `ord('a')` is 97).
   - Finally, it prints the three characters as a single string.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
  - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the first two letters is less than 52 but greater than 26. For example, if `lex` is 27, the function will append 1 and 1 to `arr` and leave `lex` as 25, which is incorrect.
  - The function should instead try to maximize the value of the first letter while ensuring the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should:
  - Maximize the value of the first letter while ensuring the remaining sum can be represented by the second and third letters.
  - If the first letter is maximized, then maximize the second letter, and the third letter will be the remainder.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Initialize the array to store the positions of the letters
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Determine the largest possible value for the first letter
        arr[0] = min(26, lex - 2)
        lex -= arr[0]
        
        # Determine the largest possible value for the second letter
        arr[1] = min(26, lex - 1)
        lex -= arr[1]
        
        # The remaining value is the third letter
        arr[2] = lex
        
        # Sort the array to ensure lexicographically smallest order
        arr.sort()
        
        # Print the three-character string
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
        # Print a newline after each test case
        print()

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **First Letter:**
  - We set `arr[0]` to the maximum possible value (up to 26) while ensuring that the remaining sum (`lex - arr[0]`) can still be represented by two letters (hence `min(26, lex - 2)`).
- **Second Letter:**
  - We set `arr[1]` to the maximum possible value (up to 26) while ensuring that the remaining sum (`lex - arr[1]`) can still be represented by one letter (hence `min(26, lex - 1)`).
- **Third Letter:**
  - The remaining value is assigned to `arr[2]`.
- **Sorting and Printing:**
  - The array is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
  - The characters are printed, and a newline is added after each test case.

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the positions of the letters.
- The corrected program ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is found for each encoded value.

Correctness: **False**
