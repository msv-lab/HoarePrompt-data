Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers provided by the user, where `x` is an integer representing the difficulty of the original problem (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and `n` is an integer representing the number of sub-problems (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `x` and `n` are still valid.
