Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, x and n, where x is an integer representing the difficulty of the original problem (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n is an integer representing the number of sub-problems (1 ≤ n ≤ x).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to correctly solve the problem:

```python
def max_balance(x, n):
```

Given this, the correct precondition is:

Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**
