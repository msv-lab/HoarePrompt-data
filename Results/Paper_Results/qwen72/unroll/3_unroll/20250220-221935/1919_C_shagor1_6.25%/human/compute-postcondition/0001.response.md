Output State: **For each test case, the variable `ans` will contain the number of integers in the array `a` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations of the inner loop have finished. The variables `x` and `y` will contain the smallest and second smallest integers in the array `a` (or `n + 1` if no such integers exist). The initial state of `t` and the sum of `n` over all test cases remains unchanged.**
