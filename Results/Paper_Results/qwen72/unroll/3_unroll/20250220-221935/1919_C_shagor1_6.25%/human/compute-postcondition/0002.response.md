The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function also accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, and `a` itself, which is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the results of processing each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the general functionality of the function `func` is to accept a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a`, and return the results of processing these test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the results of processing each test case.**
