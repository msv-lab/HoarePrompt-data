Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, converting the necessary values to integers and splitting the input lines appropriately.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the path for both Bodya and Sasha through the permutation `p` and the score list `a`.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops, which is a good approach given the nature of permutations.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the path they take and the number of turns `k`.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the path and calculates the score for each turn, ensuring that the score is maximized by staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the game duration `k` is less than the number of positions in the path, which ensures that it does not access out-of-bounds indices in the lists.
   - The function also handles the case where the starting positions are the same, which is a valid scenario in the problem description.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only needs to traverse the permutation and score lists once for each player, and it uses a loop to calculate the scores up to the game duration `k`.

7. **Unnecessary Variables**:
   - The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the function. These can be safely removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the paths and scores is sound, and the output is correctly determined based on the scores.

Correctness: **True**
