Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array of scores. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
