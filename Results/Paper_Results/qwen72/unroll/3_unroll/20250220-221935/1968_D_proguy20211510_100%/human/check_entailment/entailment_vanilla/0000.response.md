### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the path for both Bodya and Sasha from their starting positions.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The path is constructed by appending the score at the current position and then moving to the next position in the permutation until a visited position is encountered.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for each player over `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the path and calculates the score for each turn.
   - The score for each turn is calculated as the cumulative score up to that turn plus the score at the current position multiplied by the remaining turns.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum score for each player.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the function compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Potential Issues:
- **Path Calculation:**
  - The path calculation is correct in terms of following the permutation and avoiding infinite loops.
  - However, the path calculation should consider the possibility of cycles in the permutation. The current implementation does not handle cycles explicitly, but it does break the loop when a visited position is encountered, which is sufficient.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation logic is correct. It correctly handles the cumulative score and the remaining turns.
  - The use of `max` to find the maximum score is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by breaking the loop when `k` is less than the current turn index.
  - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same or where the permutation and array are very large (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in terms of the problem description and the constraints. It correctly calculates the paths and scores for both players and determines the winner based on the scores.

### Correctness:
