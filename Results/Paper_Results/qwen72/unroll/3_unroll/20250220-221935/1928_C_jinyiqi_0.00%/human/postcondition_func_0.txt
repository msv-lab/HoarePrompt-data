The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` are listed first, followed by the divisors that are less than the square root of `x` in reverse order. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
