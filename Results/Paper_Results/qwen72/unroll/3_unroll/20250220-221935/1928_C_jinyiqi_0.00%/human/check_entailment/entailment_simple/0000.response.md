### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a specific pattern of numbering students in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \(k\) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \(n\) and the number he received \(x\).

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \(k\).
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), \(k\) must be such that the pattern fits the constraints \(1 \le x < n \le 10^9\).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The number \(x\) Vasya received can only be in the first \(k\) positions or the next \(k-2\) positions.
   - The position \(n\) can be expressed in terms of \(k\) as \(n = m(2k - 2) + r\) where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(r\) is the remainder.
   - \(r\) must be within the valid range for the pattern to fit \(x\).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values: \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It then calls `func_1` to find all divisors of these values.
   - It checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \(x\), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \(x\).
   - It returns a list of divisors in a specific order: first the divisors greater than or equal to the square root of \(x\), followed by the divisors less than or equal to the square root of \(x\) in reverse order.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It correctly filters the divisors to ensure they fit the pattern constraints.
   - The logic for determining valid \(k\) values is sound, as it checks the necessary conditions for the pattern to fit \(x\).
   - The final step of removing duplicates and counting the valid \(k\) values is also correct.
