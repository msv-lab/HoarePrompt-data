The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. The function returns a list that combines two sublists: `output2`, which contains divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1`, which contains divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**
