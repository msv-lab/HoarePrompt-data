You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` are listed first, followed by the divisors that are less than the square root of `x` in reverse order. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
10 2
```
According to the problem description, the possible values of \( k \) that fit the constraints are 2, 3, 5, and 6. The expected output for this test case is 4.

However, the provided program does not correctly compute this. The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a given number, but it does not correctly handle the divisors and their corresponding \( k \) values. Specifically, the logic for appending \( k \) values to the `output` list is flawed, and it does not correctly filter out invalid \( k \) values.

Let's break down the logic:
1. The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
2. It then calls `func_1` to find the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
3. For each divisor, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` to append the corresponding \( k \) value to the `output` list.
4. Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list.

The issue lies in the way divisors are handled and the conditions for appending \( k \) values. The program does not correctly account for the periodic nature of the settling pattern and the constraints \( k > 1 \).

For example, for \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \):
- The divisors of `10 + 2 - 2 = 10` are 1, 2, 5, 10.
- The divisors of `10 - 2 = 8` are 1, 2, 4, 8.
- The program should correctly filter and append the valid \( k \) values (2, 3, 5, 6) but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
