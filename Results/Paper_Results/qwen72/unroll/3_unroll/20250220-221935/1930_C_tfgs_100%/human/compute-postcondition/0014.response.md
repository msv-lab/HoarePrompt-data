To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `a` remains the same (we don't have the explicit value of `a`, but we know it is a list).
   - `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged (we don't have their values, but they are not relevant to the `ans` list).
   - `counter` has all counts reduced to 0 (we don't have the explicit value of `counter`, but it is not relevant to the `ans` list).
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` contains all elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.
   - The last `cnt` elements of `ans` are each 1 less than the previous element.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - The elements of `a` are sorted in descending order.
   - Additional elements are added to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.
   - Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added at the end of `ans` to ensure the difference of 1.

3. **Example Construction:**
   - Suppose `a` is `[5, 3, 1]`.
   - Sorting `a` in descending order gives `[5, 3, 1]`.
   - To ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, we might need to add additional elements. For example:
     - Between 5 and 3, the difference is 2, so no additional element is needed.
     - Between 3 and 1, the difference is 2, so no additional element is needed.
   - Therefore, `ans` would be `[5, 3, 1]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2. Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added at the end.

Output: **[elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2]**
