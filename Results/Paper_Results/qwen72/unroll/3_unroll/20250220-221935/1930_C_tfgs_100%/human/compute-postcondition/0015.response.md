The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is based on the input `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is determined by the values of `n` and `a` for each test case.**
