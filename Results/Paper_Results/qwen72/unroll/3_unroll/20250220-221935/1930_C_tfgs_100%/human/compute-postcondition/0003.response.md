Output State: **For each integer `n` in the test cases, the list `a` will have each of its elements incremented by the corresponding index plus one. Specifically, for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the element `a[i]` will be increased by `i + 1`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged.**
