Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
