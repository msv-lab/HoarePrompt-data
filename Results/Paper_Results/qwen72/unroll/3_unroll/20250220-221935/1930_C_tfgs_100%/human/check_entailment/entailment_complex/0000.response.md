### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle the processing for each test case, but it is called without passing any arguments. This is incorrect because the function should take the test case details as parameters.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect. It should take the number of elements `n` and the list `a` as parameters.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function correctly reads the input for each test case and processes the array `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one.
   - It then uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.

4. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The function converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order.
   - It initializes a list `ans` to store the final result and a variable `cnt` to keep track of the number of elements that need to be added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and adds them to `ans`.
   - It also adds additional elements to `ans` to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, using the `Counter` to manage the frequency of elements and the `cnt` variable to track the number of additional elements needed.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the correct format for the output.

### Issues:
- **Function Call and Definition:**
  - The function `func_1()` should be defined to take parameters and should be called with those parameters.
  - The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, a):` and it should be called as `func_1(n, a)` inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, a)

def func_1(n, a):
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    cur = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    print(*ans)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the function is called with the correct parameters and the function definition is updated to accept those parameters.
- **False** if the function is not called with the correct parameters or the function definition is not updated.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1()` is not defined to take parameters and is not called with the necessary arguments. This will lead to a runtime error or incorrect behavior.
