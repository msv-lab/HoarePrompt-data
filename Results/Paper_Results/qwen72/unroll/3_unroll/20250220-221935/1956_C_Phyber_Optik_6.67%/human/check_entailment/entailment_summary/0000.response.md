Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) to either a row or a column of the matrix. The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times.

The provided program attempts to achieve this by calculating a sum and a value `r` in a loop, and then printing the sum and the number of operations `n + r`. However, the logic used to calculate `sum` and `r` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The loop condition and the way `sum` is incremented do not directly contribute to the maximum sum calculation.

To achieve the maximum sum, the program should simply fill the matrix with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row and each column. This can be done in exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly maximizes the sum:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Explanation:
1. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: The maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times.
2. **Print the Maximum Sum and Number of Operations**: The number of operations is \( 2n \) (one for each row and one for each column).
3. **Perform the Operations**: For each row and each column, assign the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

Given the provided program, it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
