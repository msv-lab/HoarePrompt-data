You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The function should be designed to read input from stdin or another source, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by t lines, each containing a single integer n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variables `n`, `sum`, and `r` will have been updated for each test case. For each test case, `n` will be the last input integer, `sum` will be the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop, and `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The loop will print the final values of `sum` and `n + r` for each test case, followed by a series of printed lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n + r`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, where each test case contains an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It returns the result for each matrix size `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
