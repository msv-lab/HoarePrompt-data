### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing up to \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is achieved when every element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve Maximum Sum:**
   - To achieve this, we can set each row to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) and each column to the same permutation.
   - However, the program provided does not follow this approach.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program calculates a sum and a value `r` using a loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
             r = i
             sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
         else:
             sum += i * n
     ```
   - This loop is attempting to accumulate a sum based on a condition that is not clear from the problem statement. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not relevant to the problem of maximizing the sum of the matrix.
   - The program then prints `sum` and `n + r`, which are not the correct values for the maximum sum and the number of operations.

5. **Output Analysis:**
   - The program prints a series of operations, but the operations are not correctly structured to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The operations are printed as:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
         if j <= n:
             print(1, j, end=' ')
             print(*range(1, n + 1))
         else:
             print(2, j % n, end=' ')
             print(*range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This means the first \( n \) operations set each row to the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), and the next \( r \) operations set each column to the same permutation.
   - However, this does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

6. **Expected Output:**
   - For each test case, the correct output should be:
     - The maximum sum \( n^3 \).
     - The number of operations \( 2n \).
     - \( n \) operations of type 1, setting each row to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
     - \( n \) operations of type 2, setting each column to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix or generate the correct operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
