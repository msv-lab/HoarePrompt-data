Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the output for the "stair" condition. The problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without an 'S'), but the program outputs "STAIRS". This discrepancy means the program does not match the required output format exactly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version will output "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS" and will be considered correct based on the problem description.
