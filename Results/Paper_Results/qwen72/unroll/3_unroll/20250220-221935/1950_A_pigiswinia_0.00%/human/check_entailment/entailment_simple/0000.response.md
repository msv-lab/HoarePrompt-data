Reasoning:  
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output. According to the problem description, the output should be "STAIR" for a stair and "PEAK" for a peak. However, the program outputs "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the condition `a < b < c` is met. This discrepancy in the output string will cause the program to produce incorrect results according to the specified output format.

Correctness: **False**
