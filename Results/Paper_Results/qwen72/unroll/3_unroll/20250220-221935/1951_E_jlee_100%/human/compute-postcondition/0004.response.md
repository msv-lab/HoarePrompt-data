Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes no input parameters but reads from standard input. The first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The function checks if the string can be split into one or two non-empty parts such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If the string meets the conditions, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the parts of the string. If the string does not meet the conditions, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all `t` test cases and does not modify any external variables. **
