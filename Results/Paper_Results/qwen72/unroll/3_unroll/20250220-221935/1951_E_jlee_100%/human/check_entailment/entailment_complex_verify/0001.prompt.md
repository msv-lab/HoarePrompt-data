You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to take an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list` where `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and each string `s` in `s_list` consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6).

    #State: The function `func` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'NO' if the string does not meet the conditions, or 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the parts of the string if it does meet the conditions. The variables `t` and `s_list` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes no input parameters but reads from standard input. The first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The function checks if the string can be split into one or two non-empty parts such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If the string meets the conditions, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the parts of the string. If the string does not meet the conditions, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all `t` test cases and does not modify any external variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.

2. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string `s` has only one character (`n == 1`), it correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the entire string is not a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "YES" with the partition being the entire string itself.

4. **All Characters the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the program correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same**:
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the program checks if the string length is odd and if the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the partition being the entire string itself.

6. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`x`).
   - It then continues to find the second character that is different from `x` and attempts to partition the string into two substrings.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" with the partition details.
   - If no valid partition is found by the end of the loop, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the General Case:
- The program attempts to find a partition where at least one character in the first part is different from the first character and at least one character in the second part is different from the first character.
- This approach ensures that both parts are not palindromes, as a substring with all identical characters is a palindrome.
- The logic for finding the partition is complex but generally correct. It checks for the first and second different characters and tries to split the string accordingly.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases such as strings with all identical characters and strings with only one character correctly.
- For strings where all but one character are the same, it correctly checks the middle character for odd-length strings.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for finding the partition in the general case is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.
- The program does not handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings in a more straightforward manner.

### Simplified Approach:
- A simpler approach would be to check if the string is a palindrome. If it is not, print "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
- If the string is a palindrome, check if it can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings by finding the first and second different characters.

### Conclusion:
- The program is logically correct and handles the problem as described.
- However, the implementation is more complex than necessary and could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem as described, although it could be simplified for better clarity.
