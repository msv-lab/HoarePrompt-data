Output State: **The function `func` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'NO' if the string does not meet the conditions, or 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the parts of the string if it does meet the conditions. The variables `t` and `s_list` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
