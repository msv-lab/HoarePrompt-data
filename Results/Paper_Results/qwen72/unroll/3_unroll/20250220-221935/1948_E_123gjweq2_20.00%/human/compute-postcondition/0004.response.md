To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(mid):
```
- The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

### Initial State
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0.
- `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`.

### Adjusting the State
- For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0.
- This means `(right - left) // 2` must be greater than 0.
- Therefore, `right - left` must be greater than 0, which implies `right` must be greater than `left`.

### Final Adjusted State
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, which is now guaranteed to be greater than 0.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

### State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`**
