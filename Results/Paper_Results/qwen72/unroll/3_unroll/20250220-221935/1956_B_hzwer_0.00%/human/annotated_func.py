#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand, and an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives. The list `a` contains integers from 1 to n, and each integer appears at most twice. The integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` list is updated such that for each `i` from `n-3` down to `0`, and for each `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, the value `dp[i][j]` is set based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears twice in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]` after updating the `dp` list based on the conditions provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It expects the first input to be an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and the second input to be a list of integers `cards` representing the cards in your hand. The function then computes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is determined based on the presence and count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The function returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which represents the optimal score or outcome based on the dynamic programming computation. The `cards` list and the integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.
