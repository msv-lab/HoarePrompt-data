Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand, and an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives. The list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears at most twice. The integer `n` is now the value of the input integer, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
