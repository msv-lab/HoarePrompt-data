Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand, and an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives. The list `a` contains integers from 1 to n, and each integer appears at most twice. The integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to correctly handle the input:

```python
def func_1(a, n):
```

This function will then process the list `a` and the integer `n` to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.
