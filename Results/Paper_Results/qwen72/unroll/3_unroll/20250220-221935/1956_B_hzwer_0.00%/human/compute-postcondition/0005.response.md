The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 (since `n - 3` should be a valid starting point for the loop).

Before the loop starts, `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0. These conditions do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` should start at `n - 3`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 3`**
