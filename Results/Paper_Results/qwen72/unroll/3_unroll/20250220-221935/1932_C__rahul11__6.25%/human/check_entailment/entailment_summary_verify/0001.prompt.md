You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, a list `arr` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of length `n` where `res[0]` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. For each subsequent index `k` in `res`, if `s[k-1]` is 'L', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the left side (excluding the first `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. If `s[k-1]` is 'R', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the right side (excluding the last `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `res` of length `n` to store the results.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the elements in the array.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then takes the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

4. **Command Processing:**
   - The program uses a loop to process each command in the string `s`.
   - It maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element `arr[l]`, updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`, and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element `arr[r]`, updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`, and decrements `r`.
   - The variable `c` is used to keep track of the current position in the `res` list.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the program prints the results stored in `res`.

### Issues:
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it in the modulo operations. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the problem only requires the modulo `m`.
  - The modulo operation `ans % m % MOD` is redundant and should be simplified to `ans % m`.

- **Division in Modular Arithmetic:**
  - In modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward. Instead of using `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, you should use the modular inverse to correctly compute the division under modulo `m`.
  - The correct way to handle division in modular arithmetic is to multiply by the modular inverse of the element being removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def modular_inverse(a, m):
    # Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse
    def extended_gcd(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return (b, 0, 1)
        else:
            (g, x, y) = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
            return (g, y - (b // a) * x, x)
    
    (g, x, y) = extended_gcd(a, m)
    if g != 1:
        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')
    else:
        return x % m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected to use modular inverse for division.
- **False** if the program remains as is, because it does not handle division correctly in modular arithmetic.

### Final Answer:
