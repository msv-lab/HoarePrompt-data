### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `res` of length `n` to store the results.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the elements in the array.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then takes the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

4. **Command Processing:**
   - The program uses a loop to process each command in the string `s`.
   - It maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element `arr[l]`, updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`, and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element `arr[r]`, updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`, and decrements `r`.
   - The variable `c` is used to keep track of the current position in the `res` list.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the program prints the results stored in `res`.

### Issues:
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it in the modulo operations. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the problem only requires the modulo `m`.
  - The modulo operation `ans % m % MOD` is redundant and should be simplified to `ans % m`.

- **Division in Modular Arithmetic:**
  - In modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward. Instead of using `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, you should use the modular inverse to correctly compute the division under modulo `m`.
  - The correct way to handle division in modular arithmetic is to multiply by the modular inverse of the element being removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def modular_inverse(a, m):
    # Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse
    def extended_gcd(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return (b, 0, 1)
        else:
            (g, x, y) = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
            return (g, y - (b // a) * x, x)
    
    (g, x, y) = extended_gcd(a, m)
    if g != 1:
        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')
    else:
        return x % m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not handle division correctly in modular arithmetic. Division in modular arithmetic requires the use of the modular inverse.
- The corrected program uses the modular inverse to handle division correctly, ensuring that the product is updated correctly after each command.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
