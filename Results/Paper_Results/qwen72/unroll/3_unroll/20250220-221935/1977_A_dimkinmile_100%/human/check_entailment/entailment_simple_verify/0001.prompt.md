You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function can handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which is a space-separated string of two integers. If `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, then the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, meaning `n - m` is even and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `kreker` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes added or removed.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary because you cannot have a negative number of moves to achieve a positive number of cubes.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:
- The logic is correct because:
  - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the number of moves can be split into an equal number of additions and removals (or all additions) to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
  - If `n - m` is odd or negative, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes with `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
