### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Logic for Determining Tower Height**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` ensures that:
     - `n - m` is even, which means that the number of moves to add or remove cubes is balanced in a way that the final height can be exactly `m`.
     - `n - m >= 0`, which means that `n` is at least as large as `m`, allowing for the possibility of reaching exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**:
   - If the condition is met, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `3 3`, `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".
   - For the test case `2 4`, `n - m = -2` (not non-negative), so the output is "No".
   - For the test case `5 3`, `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 100\) and \(1 \le n, m \le 100\) correctly.
   - The logic ensures that the program will work for all valid inputs within these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The conditions and the output are consistent with the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
