#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The console screen is cleared. `s` is assigned the value 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. `t` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, if `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that contains `n` special characters. The string `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from `s` twice, starting from the first character, until the required length `n` is reached. If `n` is odd, the string `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It clears the console screen and then processes a series of test cases. The number of test cases, `t`, is taken as input from the user, and for each test case, another input `n` is taken, representing the number of special characters required in a string. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` characters. For even `n`, `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, starting from 'A'. For odd `n`, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the same repeating pattern until the length `n` is reached. The function does not return any value.
