Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `n` for each test case, as described in the problem statement.
2. **Special Case Handling**: The program correctly identifies that there is no valid string when `n` is 1 and prints 'NO'. This is because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and with `n` being 1, it is impossible to satisfy this condition.
3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice. This ensures that each character is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' to ensure the first three characters are special, and then continues the pattern of repeating each subsequent character twice. This also ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters.
4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be created, and 'NO' otherwise. The length of the string is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

However, there is a minor issue with the program:
- **Console Clearing**: The program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console screen. This is specific to Windows and may not work on other operating systems. For cross-platform compatibility, it would be better to use `os.system('clear')` for Unix-based systems or handle it conditionally. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution in terms of the problem's requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the behavior described in the execution summary, the program is correct in its logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
