The code snippet `os.system('cls')` clears the console screen. It does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The function `func` is still expected to handle multiple test cases, and the values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function. The console screen is cleared.**
