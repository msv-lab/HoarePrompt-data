The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), and `n` is an integer representing the number of special characters required in the string for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

For each test case, the function should return a string containing exactly `n` special characters. If the function is provided with invalid input (e.g., `n` is out of the specified range), it should handle this appropriately, though the specific error handling is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` is the number of special characters required in the string for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it returns a string containing exactly `n` special characters.**
