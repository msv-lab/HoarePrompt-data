### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly identifies that if `n` is 1, there is no valid string that can be constructed. This is because a single special character cannot be equal to exactly one of its neighbors (it would need to be equal to both its neighbors, which is impossible with a single character). Therefore, it prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function constructs a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs the string by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, starting from 'A'. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is odd, the function starts the string with 'AAA' and then continues the pattern of repeating each character twice. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the rest of the string follows the same pattern.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` if `n` is greater than 1.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The function ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
