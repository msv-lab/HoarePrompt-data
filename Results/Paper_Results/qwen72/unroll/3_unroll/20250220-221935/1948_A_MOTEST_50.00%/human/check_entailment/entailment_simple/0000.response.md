### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1. According to the problem, a string with exactly one special character cannot exist because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot satisfy this condition. Therefore, the program prints 'NO' for `n == 1`.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each character from `s` (which is the uppercase Latin alphabet) twice, starting from the first character. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts the string with 'AAA' and then continues the pattern of repeating each character from `s` twice. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the rest of the string follows the same pattern.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` for each valid test case.
   - The length of the string `ans` is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - For other values of `n`, the program ensures that the string `ans` is constructed correctly and meets the requirements of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It constructs the string as specified and ensures that the output is valid for all given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
