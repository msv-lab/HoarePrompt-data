Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in how it determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and prints `-1` if they are, which is correct. However, the method it uses to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect.

The program calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered. This approach does not account for the possibility that there might be other sequences of consecutive elements that need to be considered to make the array non-beautiful. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the count of consecutive `1`s at the beginning, which is 1, and will output `1`. However, the correct answer is `1` because removing any one of the `2`s will make the array non-beautiful.

The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no operation can make all elements the same. This involves checking for the smallest segment of the array that, when removed, breaks the condition for the array being beautiful.

Given the current implementation, the program will fail for some test cases where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still requires a different number of removals to become non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
