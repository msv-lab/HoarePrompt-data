Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if they are, outputs -1. However, the part where it tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with `Decimal('Infinity')` and then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`val`). It updates `ans` with the minimum count of these consecutive elements.
   - This approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. It only considers the count of the first element and does not account for other elements or the structure of the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. It should consider the structure of the array and the positions where operations can be applied.

3. **Logical Error**:
   - The program should check for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property, which involves ensuring that no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) exists such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

A correct approach would involve:

- Identifying the positions where the array can be modified.
- Calculating the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no such positions exist.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n <= 2:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Count the number of elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
            count += 1
    
    # If count is 0, the array is already not beautiful
    if count == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        # The minimum number of elements to remove is the count of such positions
        print(count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This corrected program:

- Checks if the array length is less than or equal to 2, in which case it is impossible to make it not beautiful.
- Checks if all elements are the same, in which case it outputs -1.
- Counts the number of elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property by ensuring no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) exists such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`.
- Outputs the count of such elements to remove. If the count is 0, it means the array is already not beautiful.
