Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: 
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.
3. **Extracting the Subarray**: 
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray that contains all the chips, from the first chip to the last chip.
4. **Counting Free Cells**: 
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

This approach works because the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips is the number of free cells between the first and last chip in the ribbon. The program correctly identifies these positions and counts the free cells in between, which is the correct solution to the problem.
