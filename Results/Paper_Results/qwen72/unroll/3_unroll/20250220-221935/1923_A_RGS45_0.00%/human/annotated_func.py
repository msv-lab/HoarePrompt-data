#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the necessary input as described in the problem, but the function definition is incomplete and does not include parameters. The input should consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the list of cells. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be re-assigned for each iteration based on the input provided for that test case. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the number of cells, and a string `arr` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, where '1' represents a cell with a chip and '0' represents a free cell. It then calculates and prints the number of free cells (i.e., '0's) between the first and last chip (i.e., '1's) in the string `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last test case processed.
