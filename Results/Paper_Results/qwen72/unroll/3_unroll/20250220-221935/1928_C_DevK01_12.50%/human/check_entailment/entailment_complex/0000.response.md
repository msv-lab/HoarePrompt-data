### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves a sequence where the first \( k \) positions are numbered from 1 to \( k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) positions numbered from \( k-1 \) down to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must satisfy the condition that \( n \) modulo \( 2k-2 \) results in a position that corresponds to \( x \) in the sequence.
   - The position \( n \) can be either in the first \( k \) positions or in the next \( k-2 \) positions.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls the function `func_1(q, x)`.
   - The function `func_1` finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding complementary divisors.
   - The program then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and if so, adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to the list \( L1 \).
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique elements in \( L1 \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to \( M \).
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \( q \).
   - For each divisor \( i \) of \( q \), it checks if \( i \) and \( q // i \) are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds them to \( M \).
   - The function returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the use of `func_1` to find divisors are correct.
   - The additional check for \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and the second call to `func_1` are necessary to cover all possible \( k \) values.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates and the final printing of the length of the unique elements in \( L1 \) are correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly identifies and counts the natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

Correctness: **True**
