The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both are integers and satisfy the condition 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i`), also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
