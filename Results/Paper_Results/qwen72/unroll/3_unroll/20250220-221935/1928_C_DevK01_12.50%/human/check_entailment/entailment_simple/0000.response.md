### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vasya is in position `n` and received number `x` during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to find all possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates `q = (y - 2) // 2` and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional divisors.
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two parameters `q` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to `M`.
   - It iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w) - 1` and checks if they are divisors of `q`. If they are, and if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds them to `M`. It also adds their complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i`) if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing `0` and moving to the next test case.
   - The calculation of `q` and the use of `func_1` to find divisors is correct.
   - The additional check for `n >= 3 * x - 2` and the second call to `func_1` is also correct.
   - The program correctly combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `y` is odd.
   - It also handles the edge case where `n < 3 * x - 2` by not making the second call to `func_1`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as it uses a square root approach to find divisors, which is O(âˆšq).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
