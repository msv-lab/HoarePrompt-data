Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where `n` is equal to `x`. According to the problem description, if `n == x`, then the only possible value for `k` is `n + 1`, but the program does not account for this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The program calculates `y` as `n + x` and then checks if `y % 2 != 0`. However, this check is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, `y` is `12`, which is even, but the program should still correctly determine the possible values of `k`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It adds the square root `w` to the list `M` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, but this is not always the correct condition. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `q` is a perfect square.

4. **Incorrect Set Conversion**: The program converts the list `L1` to a set to remove duplicates, but it does not ensure that the values in `L1` are valid `k` values according to the problem description. Specifically, it does not check if the values are greater than 1.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 10`, `x = 2`
- Expected Output: `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6)
- Actual Output: The program may not correctly identify all valid `k` values due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
