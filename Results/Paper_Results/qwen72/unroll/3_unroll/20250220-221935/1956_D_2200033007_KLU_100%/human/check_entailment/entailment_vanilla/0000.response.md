### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For an array of length `n`, the MEX can be at most `n` because the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array can be at most `n`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The provided program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.

4. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the maximum sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the maximum sum is `max(1, arr[start_index])`.
   - For subarrays, it tries to split the array at different points and calculates the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarray and the sums of the resulting subarrays.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

5. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first calculates the maximum sum using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum sum is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - Otherwise, it recursively splits the subarray to find the optimal sequence of operations.

6. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and sets the elements to the MEX value.

7. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound for small `n` (up to 18).
   - The memoization ensures that the function does not perform redundant calculations, which is crucial for efficiency.
   - The recursive splitting and MEX calculation are correctly implemented to maximize the sum.
   - The `make_stairs` function correctly transforms the subarray to achieve the desired MEX values.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays of length 1 and arrays where the initial sum is already maximized.
   - The operations are constructed to ensure that the maximum sum is achieved within the allowed number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints. It uses a dynamic programming approach to maximize the sum of the array elements and constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

**Correctness: True**
