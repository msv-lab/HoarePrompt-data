Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i - 1 < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index, and `i` is greater than 0.**
