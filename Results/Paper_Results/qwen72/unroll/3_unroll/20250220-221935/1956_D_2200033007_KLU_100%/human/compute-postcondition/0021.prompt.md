You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), and res is a list of tuples that will store the operations.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, `is_already_stairs` is False if any element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index, and `i` is greater than 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i - 1 < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index, and `i` is greater than 0.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i - 1 < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the element at `arr[start_index + (i - 1)]` is equal to `i - 1`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` are set to `i - 1`, and `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer. It also implicitly uses a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `start_index` such that `0 <= start_index + i < len(arr)`, and a list of tuples `res` to store operations. If the function reaches a point where it needs to return, it either returns `None` (Case_1) or does not return any value (Case_2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
