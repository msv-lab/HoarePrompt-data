Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index, and `i` is greater than 0. Additionally, the element at `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`.**
