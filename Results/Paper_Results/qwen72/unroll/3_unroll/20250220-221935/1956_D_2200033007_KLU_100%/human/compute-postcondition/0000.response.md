Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, `is_already_stairs` is True.**

The variable `is_already_stairs` has been assigned the value `True`, and the initial state of the other variables (`i`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res`) remains unchanged.
