You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers 'results' where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of y and the gcd of x and y for each x in the list 'test_cases'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list `results` containing these values of `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, and `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the gcd of `x` and `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the loop where it attempts to find the best `y` for each `x`. Specifically, the `break` statement is used inside the loop, which causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds the first `y` that satisfies the condition `current_sum > max_sum`. This means that the program does not necessarily find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.

For example, consider the input `x = 10`. The loop will start with `y = 9`:
- `gcd(10, 9) = 1`, so `current_sum = 1 + 9 = 10`.
- Since `10 > 0` (the initial value of `max_sum`), the program sets `max_sum = 10` and `best_y = 9`, and then breaks out of the loop.

However, if the loop continued, it would find:
- `y = 5`: `gcd(10, 5) = 5`, so `current_sum = 5 + 5 = 10`.
- `y = 4`: `gcd(10, 4) = 2`, so `current_sum = 2 + 4 = 6`.
- `y = 3`: `gcd(10, 3) = 1`, so `current_sum = 1 + 3 = 4`.
- `y = 2`: `gcd(10, 2) = 2`, so `current_sum = 2 + 2 = 4`.

The correct `y` for `x = 10` should be `5` because it maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` (both `5` and `9` give the same maximum sum of `10`, but `5` is a valid answer as per the problem statement). However, the program returns `9` due to the premature `break` statement.

To fix this, the `break` statement should be removed, and the loop should run to completion to ensure that the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is found.
