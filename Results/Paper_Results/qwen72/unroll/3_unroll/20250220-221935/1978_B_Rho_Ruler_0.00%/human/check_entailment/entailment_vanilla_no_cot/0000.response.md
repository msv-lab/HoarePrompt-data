Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The binary search approach used in the program is not appropriate for this problem, and the function `func_1` does not accurately determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Issues:
1. **Binary Search Misuse**: The binary search is being used to find a value of `k` that satisfies a condition, but the condition being checked (`ans <= n * max(a, b)`) is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. The goal is to maximize profit, not to find a `k` that satisfies a certain inequality.

2. **Incorrect Profit Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` but does not compare it with the maximum profit found so far. It only checks if the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not a useful condition for this problem.

3. **Output of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is used to store the last valid `k` found by the binary search, but the output should be the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and keep track of the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as:
- The sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: `sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))`.
- The sum of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`.

The maximum profit is the maximum value of this sum over all possible values of `k`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum profit by iterating over all possible values of `k` and keeping track of the maximum profit found.
