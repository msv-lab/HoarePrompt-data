You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of length `n` where initially `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function will be called multiple times for different values of `n` within a test case, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop executes `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all iterations, the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the last input value read. The variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. The function returns the result of some operation on the array `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
