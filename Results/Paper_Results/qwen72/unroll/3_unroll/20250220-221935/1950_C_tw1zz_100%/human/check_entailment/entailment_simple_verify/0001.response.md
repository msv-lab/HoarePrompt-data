### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `hh:mm` using `input().split(':')`, which splits the string into two parts: `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the function correctly sets `h1` to the same hour and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the function correctly subtracts `12` from the hour and sets `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases, including `00:00`, `12:00`, and `23:59`.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms the state of the program at key points, ensuring that the input is correctly read and split.
- The `if-elif` chain correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determines the correct `AM` or `PM` designation.
- The `print` statement correctly formats the output as required.

### Final Assessment:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The logic and output formatting are correct, and all edge cases are handled appropriately.

Final: **True**
