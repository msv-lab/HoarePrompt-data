The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.

The function is expected to return a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Given the constraints, a reasonable assumption is that the function processes the list `a` in some way that depends on `t` and `n`, and returns a result based on this processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. The function processes the list `a` based on the values of `t` and `n` and returns a result.**
