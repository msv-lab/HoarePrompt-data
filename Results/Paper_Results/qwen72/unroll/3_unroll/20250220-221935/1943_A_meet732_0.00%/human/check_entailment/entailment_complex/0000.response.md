### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the array) and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The function initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count for each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in the array `a`. Therefore, the MEX of the final array `c` will be 0, and the function prints 0.

4. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the function initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most 2 zeros if they are available.
   - The function then iterates through `cntl` starting from index 1 to `n`.
   - For each index `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can prevent Alice from picking both occurrences of `j` (if they exist). The function decrements `c` and checks if `c` has reached 0 or if `j` has reached `n`.
   - If `c` reaches 0 or `j` reaches `n`, the function prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will pick the smallest integers that are available.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will pick the smallest integers that are not picked by Alice to prevent Alice from forming a higher MEX.
   - The function correctly implements this strategy by ensuring that Alice picks at most 2 of each integer, and Bob picks the remaining one if available.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input and output requirements. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and determines the MEX of the final array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
