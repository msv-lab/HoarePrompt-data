### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0**:
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is 0. If it is, it prints 0 and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, the MEX of `c` will be 0, regardless of the moves made by Alice and Bob.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can at most add 2 zeros to `c` if they are available.
   - It then iterates through the list `cntl` starting from index 1 to `n`.
   - For each index `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it decrements `c`. This is because if an integer `j` appears less than 2 times in `a`, Bob can ensure that `j` is not in `c` by removing it on his turn.
   - If `c` reaches 0 or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the smallest integer `j` that is not in `c` (i.e., the MEX) is found when `c` reaches 0 or when all integers up to `n` have been considered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all integers in `a` are the same correctly.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The program ensures that both players play optimally by considering the minimum number of times an integer can appear in `c` before it is excluded from the MEX calculation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**True**
