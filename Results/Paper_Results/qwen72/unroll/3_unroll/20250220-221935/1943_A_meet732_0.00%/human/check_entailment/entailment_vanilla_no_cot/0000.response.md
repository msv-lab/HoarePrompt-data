Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the game's optimal strategy for both players. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the final MEX value. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Check for MEX 0**:
   - The program correctly checks if `0` is missing from the array `a` and prints `0` if it is. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is not the correct approach. The variable `c` should not be used to track the number of `0`s; instead, it should be used to track the MEX value.
   - The loop that iterates over `j` from `1` to `n` is intended to find the smallest integer `j` that is missing from the array `c` after all moves. However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect:
     - The program decrements `c` by `1` whenever `cntl[j] < 2`. This is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
     - The condition `if not c or j == n` is also incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest integer `j` that is not present in the array `c` after all moves, not by the value of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, and the goal is to determine the MEX of the final array `c` after all moves.
   - The correct approach is to consider the frequency of each integer in the array `a` and determine the smallest integer `j` that can be excluded from `c` based on the optimal moves of both players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                mex = j
                break
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Frequency Count**: We count the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using `cntl`.
- **Determine MEX**: We iterate through the integers from `0` to `n` and find the smallest integer `j` that appears less than twice in the array `a`. This integer `j` will be the MEX of the final array `c` because Alice and Bob will ensure that all integers less than `j` appear at least once in `c`.

This corrected program will correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` for each test case.
