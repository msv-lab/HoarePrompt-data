You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of queries and responses. The sequence p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries, and each query involves four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n). The response to each query is one of "<", "=", or ">", indicating the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find and output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: The loop will have found and printed a pair of indices (maxi, mini) such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation p is maximized. The variables `maxi` and `mini` will hold the indices of the elements in the permutation p that achieve this maximum XOR value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find and return a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation sequence p, such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
