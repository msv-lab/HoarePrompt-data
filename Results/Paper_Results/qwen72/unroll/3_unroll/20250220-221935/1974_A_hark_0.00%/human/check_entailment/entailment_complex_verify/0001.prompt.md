You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are values of any type that support comparison.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that support comparison, and returns the smaller of the two values. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. After the function concludes, the program has the smaller value between `a` and `b` available for further use.

    #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and they are assigned the values from the input. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`, and `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99. Based on the values of `x` and `y`, it prints a calculated value. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The function then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
     - The function calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first.
     - `bxsfory` is the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - After placing the 2x2 icons, it calculates the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.
     - `x` is adjusted by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1` is the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
     - Only 2x2 icons are present.
     - The number of screens required is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
     - Only 1x1 icons are present.
     - The number of screens required is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
     - No icons are present, so the number of screens required is 0.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input for `x` and `y` and calculates the number of screens needed based on the cases described above.
     - The logic for calculating the number of screens is correct, but there is a potential issue with the adjustment of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each screen used for 2x2 icons can still have 11 cells left for 1x1 icons.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.
     - The logic for handling multiple test cases is correct.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be corrected to `x = x - bxsfory * 11` to account for the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains a logical error in the calculation of the remaining space for 1x1 icons when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The correct line should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` instead of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This correction is necessary to ensure the program calculates the minimum number of screens correctly.
