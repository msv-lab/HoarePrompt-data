The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the output is dependent on the values of `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the function does not accept these as parameters, they must be defined or used internally within the function. The description provided does not specify the exact output based on these values, so we cannot determine the specific return value. However, we can describe the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a value that is dependent on the internal use of non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
