The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return the number of testcases as an integer by calling `func_3`, and then process each testcase using `func_6`. However, since the specific output of `func_7` is not provided, we can only infer that it likely returns a result based on the processing of these testcases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns the result of processing a number of testcases, where the number of testcases is obtained from `func_3` and each testcase is processed by `func_6`.**
