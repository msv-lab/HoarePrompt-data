The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if `args` (a tuple) is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it adds `args` to `d` with the value being the result of `func(*args)`. The function then returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. If `args` was already a key in `d`, the function simply returns the existing value associated with `args`.
