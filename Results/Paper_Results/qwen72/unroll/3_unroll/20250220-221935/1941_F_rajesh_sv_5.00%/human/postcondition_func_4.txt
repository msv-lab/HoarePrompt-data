The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter`, which is a string. It returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` and converting each split part into an integer. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the string returned by `func_2()`.
