Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case. It does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged, the variable `idx` is updated to `1 + t + sum(n for n in map(int, data[1:1+t]))`, and the variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case, where `n` is the number of elements in the test case and `a` is the list of those elements. Each element in the `results` list is printed to the standard output, but the `results` list itself remains unchanged. No other variables are affected. **
