You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy:**
   - You and Nene take turns, and each turn involves placing one card on the table.
   - If a card with the same integer is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally, meaning she will always try to score a point if possible and, if not, will try to prevent you from scoring a point in the future.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand.
   - If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can score a point for one of them (the first one you play will not score a point, but the second one will if Nene hasn't played the matching card yet).
   - Nene will always play optimally, so she will try to score points for herself and prevent you from scoring points.

4. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n, a)` calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then sums the number of integers that appear exactly twice (i.e., pairs).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can only score points for up to half of the total number of turns you have.

5. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the result for each test case.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given that Nene plays optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
