### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` takes the number of cards `n` and a list `a` of integers representing the cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers that appear exactly twice in `a`.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of integers in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The `Counter` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
     - The `pairs` variable correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
     - The return value `min(pairs, n // 2)` is correct because:
       - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of pairs you can play (since you have `n` cards and each pair consists of 2 cards).
       - `pairs` represents the number of pairs you can play based on the cards in your hand.
       - The minimum of these two values is the maximum number of points you can score, as you can only score a point for each pair you play, and you can only play up to `n // 2` pairs.

   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `a`.
     - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - It prints each result in the `results` list, which is the correct output format.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program assumes that Nene plays optimally, which means she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene will also play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given the constraints and optimal play by both players.

**Correctness: True**
