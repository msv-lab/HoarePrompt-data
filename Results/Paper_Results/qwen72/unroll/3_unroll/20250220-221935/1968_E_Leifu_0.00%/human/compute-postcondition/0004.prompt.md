You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function should internally manage the input and output, ensuring that for each test case, it outputs `n` points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop will print '1 1', '1 2', and if `n` is 3, it will print '2 3'. Otherwise, it will print '2 4' and then for each integer `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), it will print `j j`. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input integer read for the final test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function generates and returns `n` points for each test case, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these points is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
