### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start of a segment, the end of a segment, and the current number, respectively.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment correctly.
   - It iterates through the array and groups consecutive identical numbers into segments, storing the start and end indices of each segment along with the number in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks the start and end indices of the segment to determine if a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` can be found within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - The condition `if s > l` is intended to check if the start of the segment is greater than the left boundary of the query. If so, it further checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If `s` is 1 or greater than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found). Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s` (valid pair found).
   - The condition `elif e >= r` is intended to check if the end of the segment is greater than or equal to the right boundary of the query. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).
   - The condition `elif e < N or e < l` is intended to check if the end of the segment is less than `N` or `l`. If so, it prints `s` and `e+1` (valid pair found).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition `if s > l`:**
  - This condition is intended to check if the start of the segment is greater than the left boundary of the query. However, the subsequent check `if s == 1 or s > r` is not necessary and can be misleading. If `s > l`, it should directly check if `s-1` and `s` are within the query range `[l, r]` and print them if valid.
  - The condition `if s == 1 or s > r` is incorrect because it can lead to false negatives. For example, if `s == 2` and `r == 3`, the program should still print `1 2` if `nums[1] != nums[2]`.

- **Condition `elif e >= r`:**
  - This condition is intended to check if the end of the segment is greater than or equal to the right boundary of the query. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found). However, this condition is logically flawed. It should check if the segment ends before `r` to ensure that there are no valid pairs within the segment.

- **Condition `elif e < N or e < l`:**
  - This condition is redundant and can be simplified. It should simply check if the end of the segment is less than `r` and print `s` and `e+1` if valid.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the segment boundaries do not align perfectly with the query boundaries.
- The logic for determining valid pairs is flawed in some cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
- For the query `(1, 2)` in the array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the range `[1, 2]`. However, the program might output a valid pair due to incorrect boundary checks.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine valid pairs of indices, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

Final: **False**
