You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: For each iteration of the loop, the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) from the list `nums` are found, and the difference `x - y` is printed. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `l` (which is not used in the function) and a list of integers `nums` from the input. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `nums` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` (if they exist outside the function) remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.
   - The beauty can be expressed as: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - This can be simplified to: \(a_n - a_1\), because all intermediate terms cancel out.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize \(a_n - a_1\).
   - This can be achieved by setting \(a_1\) to the smallest element in the array and \(a_n\) to the largest element in the array.
   - The order of the other elements does not matter since they will cancel out in the sum.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the elements of the array \(nums\).
   - It initializes \(x\) to 0 and \(y\) to a very large number (100000000).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum value \(x\) and the minimum value \(y\).
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values in the array.
   - The difference \(x - y\) is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array, as it corresponds to the largest possible value of \(a_n - a_1\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
