Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) after rearranging the elements in any way.

The program, however, simply finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and prints their difference. This approach does not account for the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements after rearrangement.

### Correct Approach:

To maximize the beauty of the array, you should sort the array in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases \(t\).
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array \(n\).
   - Read the elements of the array.
   - **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which maximizes the sum of these differences.
   - **Calculate Beauty**: Compute the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
3. **Output the Result**: Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

This approach correctly solves the problem as described.
