The code snippet provided constructs a list `a` by taking an input string, splitting it into individual elements, converting each element to an integer, and then prepending a `0` to the list. The length of the list `a` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of integers provided in the input. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer, and the array `c` is a list of positive integers, but `c` is not used in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input, `c` is a list of positive integers.**
