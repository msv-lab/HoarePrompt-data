Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical issue in its approach to solving the problem. The key to solving this problem is to understand that Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses (x losses) and still have enough coins to continue betting.

The strategy should be to bet in such a way that even if Sasha loses x times in a row, he can still recover and win enough coins to achieve any target n. Specifically, if Sasha can afford to lose x times in a row and still have at least 1 coin left, he can then bet 1 coin and win k-1 coins, which will allow him to continue betting and eventually reach any target n.

Here's the correct approach:

1. **Initial Bet and Recovery**: Sasha should start by betting a small amount, such as 1 coin. If he loses x times in a row, he will lose a total of \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + x\) coins. The sum of the first x positive integers is given by the formula \(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2}\).

2. **Recovery Condition**: After losing x times, Sasha should still have at least 1 coin left. Therefore, the initial number of coins \(a\) must be at least \(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2} + 1\).

3. **Winning Strategy**: If Sasha has at least \(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2} + 1\) coins, he can always recover by betting 1 coin and winning \(k-1\) coins, and then continue betting to reach any target n.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Specifically, the loop and the calculation of `z` are incorrect and do not reflect the recovery strategy described above.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        max_loss = x * (x + 1) // 2
        if a >= max_loss + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Program:
- **max_loss**: This variable calculates the maximum number of coins Sasha can lose if he loses x times in a row.
- **Condition**: If Sasha's initial number of coins \(a\) is at least \(\text{max_loss} + 1\), he can always recover and win any number of coins. Otherwise, he cannot guarantee it.

This program correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve his goal for each test case.
