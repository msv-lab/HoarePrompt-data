You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range -n to n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: The `mex` list is populated with values based on the conditions in the loop. `minn` is updated to the next integer that was not included in the `mex` list due to positive elements in `arr`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list due to negative elements in `arr`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The `mex` list is printed with its elements separated by spaces. The values of `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` from the input. It processes the array `a` to generate a list `mex` of length `n` based on the values in `a`. For each element in `a`, if the element is positive, it appends the current value of `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if this difference exceeds the current `maxx`. Finally, it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation `p` based on the array `a` is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

This specific case might work, but consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 0 0 0
```

The program incorrectly outputs `0 0 0 0` instead of a valid permutation like `0 1 2 3`. This is because the logic for handling the `arr[i] == 0` case is not correctly implemented. The program should ensure that the permutation `p` is constructed such that the MEX condition is satisfied for each element in `a`.

To correctly handle all cases, the program needs to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated and used to construct the permutation `p` for each element in `a`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
