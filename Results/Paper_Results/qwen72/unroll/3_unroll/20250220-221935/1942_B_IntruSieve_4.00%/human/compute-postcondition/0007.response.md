The only objects in the loop head are the variable `itm` and the list `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `mex` list must be populated with at least one value for the loop to execute. The variable `itm` will be the first element of the `mex` list.

State: **`mex` is a list populated with at least one value, `itm` is the first value in the `mex` list**
