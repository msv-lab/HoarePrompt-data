Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of fireworks visible at the same time. The program calculates the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within the visibility period of a single firework (m + 1 minutes) and then adds these numbers together. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Period Overlap**: A firework launched at time \(x\) by the first installation will be visible from \(x\) to \(x + m\). Similarly, a firework launched at time \(y\) by the second installation will be visible from \(y\) to \(y + m\). We need to find the maximum number of such overlapping periods.

2. **GCD and LCM**: The least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) will help us determine the times when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The greatest common divisor (GCD) can be used to compute the LCM.

3. **Maximum Overlap Calculation**: We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at any given minute within the visibility period.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 1 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

Explanation:
- We first compute the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) to find the times when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
- We then calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period \(m + 1\) minutes.
- We subtract the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously to avoid double-counting.
- Finally, we add 1 to account for the initial launch at time 0.

This approach ensures that we correctly count the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
