Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, checks if the reversed integer has the same length as the original, and constructs a string `rev_res` by appending the original integers if their reversed form has the same length. If the reversed form has a different length, it appends these reversed integers to a list `rev_val`, sorts this list, and then alternates between appending the integers from `rev_val` and their reversed forms to `rev_res`. Finally, it compares the integer value of `rev_res` with \(10^m\). If `rev_res` exceeds \(10^m\), it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value. **
