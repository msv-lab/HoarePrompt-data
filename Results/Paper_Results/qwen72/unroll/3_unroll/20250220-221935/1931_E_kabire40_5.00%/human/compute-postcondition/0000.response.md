The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `y` should start at 0, as it is the typical initialization for a `for` loop using `range`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
