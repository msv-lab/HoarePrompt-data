Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values provided by `input()`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and `t` is 1. `edges` is an empty list. The list of starting nodes for each round is not affected. `empty` is `True`. `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a new empty list for any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, the list of starting nodes, and `empty` remain unchanged.
