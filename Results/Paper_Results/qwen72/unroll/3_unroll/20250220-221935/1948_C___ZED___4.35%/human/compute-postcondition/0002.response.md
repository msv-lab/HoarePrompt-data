The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, where `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 · 10^5, and the strings are composed of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function is expected to handle up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case, which is not specified in the output section. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the arrows in the two rows can be aligned in a specific way, such as whether the arrows in the first row can point to the arrows in the second row in a valid configuration.

Functionality: **The function processes up to `t` test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` composed of characters '<' and '>'. It returns a result for each test case, likely indicating whether the arrows in the two rows can be aligned in a valid configuration.**
