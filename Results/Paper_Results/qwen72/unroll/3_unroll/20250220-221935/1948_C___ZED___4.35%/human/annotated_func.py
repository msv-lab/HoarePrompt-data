#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function receives t test cases, each containing an integer n, and two strings of length n, each composed of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop are not retained as they are reinitialized for each iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the loop completes all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to `t` test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` composed of characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the conditions for a valid configuration are met: specifically, if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>', and there is no path from the first character to the last character in the grid formed by `a` and `b` where all characters in the path are '>'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reinitialized for each test case, so their final values are not retained after the loop.
