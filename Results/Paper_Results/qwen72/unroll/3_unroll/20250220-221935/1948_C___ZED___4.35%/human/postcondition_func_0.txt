The function processes up to `t` test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` composed of characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the conditions for a valid configuration are met: specifically, if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>', and there is no path from the first character to the last character in the grid formed by `a` and `b` where all characters in the path are '>'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reinitialized for each test case, so their final values are not retained after the loop.
