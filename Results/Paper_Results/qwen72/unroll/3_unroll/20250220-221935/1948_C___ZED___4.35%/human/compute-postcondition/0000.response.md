To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Value**: The loop will execute `int(input())` times. This means the input must be a non-negative integer.
2. **Loop Variable `i`**: The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The function receives `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n`, and two strings of length `n`, each composed of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than 0**
