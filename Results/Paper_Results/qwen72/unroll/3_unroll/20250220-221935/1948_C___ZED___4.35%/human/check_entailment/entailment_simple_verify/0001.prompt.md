You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop are not retained as they are reinitialized for each iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the loop completes all `t` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the number of columns in the grid.
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b`, representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`'>'`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)` because it would be impossible to move to the last column from the second-to-last column.
   - If this condition is met, the function prints `NO` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is always even and at least 2, so this condition is never true. This check is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `no_path` to `True`.
   - It then iterates over the even-indexed positions in the second row (`b`). If any of these arrows are not pointing to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this loop, it means all even-indexed arrows in the second row point to the right. The function then sets `no_path` back to `True` and iterates over the odd-indexed positions in the first row (`a`). If any of these arrows are not pointing to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both loops, it means the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` by following the arrows in the grid, and the function prints `YES`. Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

5. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The function has a logical flaw in the path checking. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but the current implementation only checks if the robot can move to the right from specific positions. This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` because it does not account for all possible movements and interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not fully account for the robot's ability to move in all directions (left, right, up, down) and does not correctly simulate the robot's path through the grid.

### Correctness: **False**
