Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the list `w`, considering the frequency of each element. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
