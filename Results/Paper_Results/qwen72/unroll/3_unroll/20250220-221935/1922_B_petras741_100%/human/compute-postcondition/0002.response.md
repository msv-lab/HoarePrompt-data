The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `buffer` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
