The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `cases` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The exact output for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes each inner list and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the `t` test cases.**
