Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', representing the preferences of the residents. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
