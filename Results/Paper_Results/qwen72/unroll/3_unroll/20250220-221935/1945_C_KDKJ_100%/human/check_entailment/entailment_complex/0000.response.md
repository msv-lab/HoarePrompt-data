### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `a` from the standard input. `n` is the number of houses, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the preferences of the residents.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   - **Condition Checking**: The function iterates through all possible positions for the road (from 0 to `n`). For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road. It then checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to `n / 2` than the previously stored position.
   - **Output**: The function prints the optimal position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input and print the optimal position for the road.
   - **No Side Effects**: The function does not modify any global variables or have any side effects other than the calls to `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum list `S` is correctly constructed, ensuring that `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
- **Condition Checking**: The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are correctly checked to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- **Optimal Position Selection**: The function correctly updates `ans` to the position that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly processes the input, calculates the prefix sums, checks the conditions, and selects the optimal position for the road.

### Correctness:
**True**
