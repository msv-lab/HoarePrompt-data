Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each iteration, the variable `ans` holds the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, `ans` is -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged for each test case, but the loop has printed the value of `ans` for each test case.**
