The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged for each test case.
