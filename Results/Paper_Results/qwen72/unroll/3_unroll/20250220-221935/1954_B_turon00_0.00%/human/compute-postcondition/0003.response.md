The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is likely that the parameters are passed within the function or are part of a larger context (e.g., a class or a module). The parameters are:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the array which is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output section. However, given the context, the function is expected to process the array `a` and return a result that is relevant to the properties of the array or the test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` for `t` test cases, where `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. It returns a result based on the properties of the array `a` for each test case.**
