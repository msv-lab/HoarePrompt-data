### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**:
   - The problem states that the array is already beautiful, so we don't need to check if it is beautiful. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful.

3. **Handling Arrays with All Identical Elements**:
   - If the array contains only one unique element (i.e., all elements are the same), it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. The program correctly handles this case by checking if the length of the set of elements `aa` is 1. If so, it prints `-1`.

4. **Counting and Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array and updates `cnt` whenever it encounters an element equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one final time to ensure the last segment of consecutive elements is considered.
   - The program then prints `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (which is not beautiful by definition, but the problem guarantees the array is beautiful).
   - It also handles the case where the array has all identical elements, as mentioned earlier.

6. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm is based on the idea that if we can find the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element, removing all elements in this segment will make the array not beautiful.
   - This is a valid approach because removing the smallest segment of consecutive elements will minimize the number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the correct approach to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
