Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with a length of 30 (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - It uses a loop to check each bit of `x` and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the bit is set or not.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function then processes the array `s` to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
   - The loop iterates through the array and adjusts the elements accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If the flag is set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is '1', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Binary Representation**:
  - The binary representation is correctly generated, but the array `s` should be reversed to match the standard binary representation (least significant bit first).

- **Adjusting for Constraints**:
  - The logic for adjusting the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):` should be handled more carefully to avoid incorrect adjustments.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final adjustments to the array and the length are not correctly implemented. The array should be processed from the least significant bit to the most significant bit to ensure the constraints are met.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Generate binary representation
        for i in range(30):
            if x & (1 << i):
                s.append(1)
                length = i + 1
            else:
                s.append(0)
        
        # Reverse the array to match the standard binary representation
        s.reverse()
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        flag = 0
        for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
            if flag and s[i] == 0:
                s[i] = 1
                flag = 0
            elif flag == 0 and s[i] == 1 and (i + 1 < length and s[i + 1] == 1):
                s[i] = -1
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = 0
            else:
                pass
        
        # Final adjustment if flag is set
        if flag:
            s.append(1)
            length += 1
        
        # Print the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(*s)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Binary Representation**:
  - The binary representation is generated in reverse order and then reversed to match the standard binary representation.
  - The length of the array is updated correctly as the bits are set.

- **Adjusting for Constraints**:
  - The array is processed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
  - The flag is used to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - If the flag is set after processing, it means the last element needs to be adjusted, and a new element '1' is appended to the array, increasing the length by 1.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors in the way it adjusts the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements, and it does not correctly handle the final adjustments. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
