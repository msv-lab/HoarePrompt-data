Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. A k-level permutation is defined such that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. The program uses an alternating pattern to construct the permutation, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the sums of the segments are balanced.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts with an initial `answer` list containing the first element `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` with two elements `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices from which to pick the next element in the alternating pattern.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends the element from the end of `array` (using `a[-1]` and decrementing `a[-1]`).
     - Otherwise, it appends the element from the beginning of `array` (using `a[0]` and incrementing `a[0]`).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Alternating Pattern:
- The alternating pattern ensures that the permutation is constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
- This pattern helps in balancing the sums of the continuous segments of length `k`.

### Verification of the k-level Condition:
- For a permutation to be k-level, the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` should differ by no more than 1.
- The alternating pattern ensures that the elements are distributed in a way that minimizes the difference in sums of the segments.

### Example Verification:
- For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[1, 3, 2]` is generated.
  - Sums of segments: `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`.
  - The difference is `5 - 4 = 1`, which satisfies the k-level condition.
- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]` is generated.
  - Sums of segments:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 23 = 1`, which satisfies the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced, and the k-level condition is met.
