You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two parameters `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific alternating pattern. The pattern alternates between taking elements from the end and the beginning of the sequence, starting with the first element. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the results for each test case, and the internal variables used in the function will be in the state corresponding to the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is even, and \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes an array `array` with the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element of the permutation as 1.
   - It initializes `a` with two indices: 1 and -1, which will be used to alternate between the start and end of the `array`.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program uses a loop to construct the permutation.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - For each iteration, it checks if \( (-1)^i \) is -1. If true, it appends the element at the end of the `array` (using `a[-1]`) and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - If false, it appends the element at the start of the `array` (using `a[0]`) and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Ensuring the k-level Property:**
   - The key idea is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the `array`.
   - This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced.
   - For example, if \( k = 4 \), the sums of segments like `[1, 8, 4, 10]` and `[8, 4, 10, 2]` will be close to each other because the elements are alternated between small and large values.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

6. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `2 1`. The sums are \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) and \( 1 + 2 = 3 \). The difference is 0, which is \(\le 1\).
     - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 3 2`. The sums are \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). The difference is 1, which is \(\le 1\).
     - For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \), the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums of segments are:
       - \( 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)
       - \( 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24 \)
       - \( 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23 \)
       - \( 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
       - \( 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23 \)
       - \( 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
       - \( 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23 \)
     - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, which is \(\le 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples. The alternating approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, satisfying the condition that any two sums differ by no more than 1.
