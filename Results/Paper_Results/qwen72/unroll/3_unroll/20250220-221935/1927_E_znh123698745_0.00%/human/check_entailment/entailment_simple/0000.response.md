### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` with two elements `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices for alternating elements.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The function uses a loop to append elements to `answer` in an alternating pattern:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends the element from the end of `array` (i.e., `array[a[-1]]`) and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If `(-1) ** i == 1`, it appends the element from the start of `array` (i.e., `array[a[0]]`) and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Alternating Pattern:
- The alternating pattern ensures that the elements are added in a way that balances the sums of continuous segments of length `k`.
- For even `k`, this pattern helps in minimizing the difference between the sums of any two continuous segments of length `k`.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2]`
  - `answer = [1, 2]`
  - Sums: `1 + 2 = 3`
  - Difference: `3 - 3 = 0` (≤ 1)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `answer = [1, 3, 2]`
  - Sums: `1 + 3 = 4`, `3 + 2 = 5`
  - Difference: `5 - 4 = 1` (≤ 1)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
  - `answer = [1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`
  - Sums: `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`, `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`, `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`, `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`, `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - Difference: `24 - 23 = 1` (≤ 1)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 13`, `k = 4`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`
  - `answer = [1, 10, 4, 13, 5, 9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 3, 11, 7]`
  - Sums: `1 + 10 + 4 + 13 = 28`, `10 + 4 + 13 + 5 = 32`, `4 + 13 + 5 + 9 = 31`, `13 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 29`, `5 + 9 + 2 + 12 = 28`, `9 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 29`, `2 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 28`, `12 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 29`, `6 + 8 + 3 + 11 = 28`, `8 + 3 + 11 + 7 = 29`
  - Difference: `32 - 28 = 4` (not ≤ 1)

### Conclusion:
- The function does not always produce a k-level permutation as required by the problem. Specifically, the sums of continuous segments of length `k` can differ by more than 1, as seen in the test case `n = 13`, `k = 4`.
