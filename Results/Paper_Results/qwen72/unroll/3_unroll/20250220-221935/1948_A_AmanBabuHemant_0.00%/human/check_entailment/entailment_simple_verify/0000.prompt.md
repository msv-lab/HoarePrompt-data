You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The function will print "NO" for odd values of n and for even values of n where the length of the generated string exceeds 200. For even values of n where the length of the generated string is less than or equal to 200, the function will print "YES" followed by the generated string. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have completed all its iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the generation of the string as required by the problem description. Specifically, the string should consist of uppercase Latin letters, but the program generates a string of '1's and '0's, which are not uppercase Latin letters. Additionally, the program does not ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem statement (i.e., characters that are equal to exactly one of their neighbors).

For example, when `n = 6`, the program generates the string `110110110110`, which does not meet the problem's requirements because it contains digits instead of uppercase letters. Furthermore, the string `110110110110` does not have exactly 6 special characters as defined in the problem statement. The correct output should be a string like `AAABAACC` (or any other valid string of uppercase letters with exactly 6 special characters).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
