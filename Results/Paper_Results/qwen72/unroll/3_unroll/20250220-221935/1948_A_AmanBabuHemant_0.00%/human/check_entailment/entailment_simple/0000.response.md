### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The function checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters if `n` is odd. This is because each special character must be part of a pair (one character equal to exactly one of its neighbors), and an odd number of special characters cannot be paired without leaving one unpaired.

3. **String Generation**:
   - If `n` is even, the function generates a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each '1' in the string is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The length of the generated string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n` in the range [1, 50] because the maximum length would be `3 * 25 = 75`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 200, the function prints "YES" followed by the generated string `s`.
   - The function does not need to check if the length of `s` exceeds 200 because the maximum length is 75, which is always within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases and generates the required output for valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
