The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
