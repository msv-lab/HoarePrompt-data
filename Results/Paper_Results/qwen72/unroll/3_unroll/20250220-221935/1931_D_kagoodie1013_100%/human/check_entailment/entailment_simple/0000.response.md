Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array a). This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Residue Calculation**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo x and y. For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
   - `r_x = -num % x` which is the residue of `-num` modulo x.
   - `r_y = num % y` which is the residue of `num` modulo y.
   This is done to check the conditions for a beautiful pair:
   - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by x if `(-a_i % x) + (a_j % x) == 0`.
   - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by y if `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) == 0`.

3. **Counting Pairs**: The program increments the count of beautiful pairs by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. This is correct because it counts the number of previous elements that, when combined with the current element, form a beautiful pair.

4. **Updating Residue Map**: The program updates the residue map with the current element's residues modulo x and y. This is done correctly by using the key `(num % x, num % y)`.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them. The output format matches the problem description.

However, there is a subtle issue with the residue calculation for `r_x`. The condition for `a_i + a_j` being divisible by x should be checked using the residues of `a_i` and `a_j` directly, not `-num % x`. The correct way to check this is to use the key `(num % x, num % y)` for both `r_x` and `r_y`.

Given this, the program is not entirely correct because it uses `r_x = -num % x` instead of `r_x = num % x`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the program should use the correct residues for both conditions. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
