Reasoning:  
The program reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array `n`, the integers `x` and `y`, and the array `a` itself. The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of beautiful pairs in each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
1. Initialize a `count` variable to zero for each test case.
2. Create a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.
3. For each number `num` in the array `a`:
   - Calculate `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
   - Increment `count` by the value in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, or by 0 if the key does not exist.
   - Calculate the current key as `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - Update `residue_map` with the current key, incrementing its count by 1.
4. Append the `count` to the `results` list.
5. Return the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is incorrect. The correct way to calculate the residue for the sum condition is `num % x`, because we need to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. The negative sign is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

The correct logic should be:
- Calculate `r_x` as `num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
- Use these residues to check for beautiful pairs.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it uses `-num % x` instead of `num % x`.

Correctness: **False**
