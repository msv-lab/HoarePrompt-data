Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then parses the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the array `arr`. This part is accurate and handles the input format as specified.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the list `test_cases`. This is also correct and ensures that the test cases are structured appropriately for further processing.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case, which is correct.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the array elements. This is also accurate.
   - It then iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each element, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is intended to ensure that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` is to use `r_x = num % x` because if `a_i % x == a_j % x`, then `a_i + a_j` will be divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is correct for ensuring that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`. This part is correct in terms of logic but relies on the incorrect calculation of `r_x`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`. This is also correct but again relies on the incorrect calculation of `r_x`.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them. This part is correct and follows the output format specified.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the residues is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `r_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `r_x = num % x` to ensure that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The use of the `residue_map` to count pairs is efficient and correct, but it is based on the incorrect residue calculation for `r_x`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the large input sizes and the range of values for `x` and `y`.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results for each.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of `r_x`. This flaw will lead to incorrect results for the number of beautiful pairs.

Final: **False**
