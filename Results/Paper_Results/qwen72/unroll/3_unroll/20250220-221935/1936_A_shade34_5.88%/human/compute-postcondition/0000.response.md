The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the loop's execution is solely dependent on the input value.

State: **The function operates within a test case environment where the input is a sequence p of integers, which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can interactively query the comparison of bitwise OR results between pairs of elements from the sequence p, and must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1.**
