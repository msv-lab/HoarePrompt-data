### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of \( y \) coins.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by \( y \).
   - He cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from \( x \) consecutive losses because the next win will always bring his total back to a positive value.
   - If \( x == k - 1 \), Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses, but he needs to have at least \( x + 2 \) coins initially to ensure he can place the next bet after \( x \) losses.
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee he can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses and still place the next bet.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input line into three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
   - It then checks the following conditions:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".
     - If \( x == k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - It calculates \( z \) starting from \( k - 2 \).
       - It iteratively increases \( z \) by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x - k + 3 \) times.
       - If \( a \geq z \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - For \( x < k - 1 \), the program correctly checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 1 \) coins. This is because after \( x \) consecutive losses, he can still place a bet and recover.
   - For \( x == k - 1 \), the program correctly checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 2 \) coins. This is because after \( x \) consecutive losses, he needs one more coin to place the next bet.
   - For \( x > k - 1 \), the program's calculation of \( z \) is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins. However, the calculation \( z = k - 2 \) and the iterative increase \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x - k + 3 \) times is not entirely correct. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of coins lost after \( x \) consecutive losses and then check if Sasha can recover from this loss.

5. **Correct Calculation for \( x > k - 1 \):**
   - The total number of coins lost after \( x \) consecutive losses is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + x \).
   - This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( x \) natural numbers: \( \text{sum} = \frac{x \cdot (x + 1)}{2} \).
   - After \( x \) consecutive losses, Sasha needs to have at least \( \frac{x \cdot (x + 1)}{2} + 1 \) coins to place the next bet and recover.

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect for the case \( x > k - 1 \) because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery from \( x \) consecutive losses.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
