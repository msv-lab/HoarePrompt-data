### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where he wins \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) coins if he wins a bet of \( y \) coins, and loses \( y \) coins if he loses.
   - The casino has a promotion where Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Sasha starts with \( a \) coins and wants to know if he can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to determine if Sasha can always recover from a series of losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses because he can always place a bet of 1 coin and win \( k - 1 \) coins, which is more than the \( x \) losses he can have. Therefore, he can always recover and continue betting.
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses if he has at least \( x + 2 \) coins initially. This is because he can place a bet of 1 coin and win \( k - 1 \) coins, which is exactly the number of coins he needs to recover from \( x \) losses.
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses if he has enough coins to cover the losses and still have a positive amount left. The program calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery using a loop.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input from the standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks the conditions:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \) and \( a \geq x + 1 \), it prints 'YES'.
     - If \( x = k - 1 \) and \( a \geq x + 2 \), it prints 'YES'.
     - If \( x > k - 1 \), it calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery using a loop and prints 'YES' if \( a \geq z \), otherwise 'NO'.

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The conditions and the logic used in the program are correct based on the problem description.
   - The loop for calculating \( z \) when \( x > k - 1 \) is correctly implemented to ensure that Sasha can always recover from \( x \) consecutive losses.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - When \( x = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \), it correctly prints 'NO' because Sasha cannot place any more bets after losing the first one.
     - When \( x = 1 \) and \( a > 1 \), it correctly prints 'YES' because Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover.
     - When \( x > 1 \), the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
