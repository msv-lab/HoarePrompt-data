Output State: **The list `sb` will remain unchanged. The list `sa` will also remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `n` will remain unchanged. The loop will print a series of strings `nx`, where each string `nx` is constructed by iterating over the rows of `xx` from 1 to `n`. For each row, if the character at position `j-1` is not '?', it will be added to `nx`. If the character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of the `sb` list (up to `n // 4 - 1`), 'S' will be added to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' will be added to `nx`.**
