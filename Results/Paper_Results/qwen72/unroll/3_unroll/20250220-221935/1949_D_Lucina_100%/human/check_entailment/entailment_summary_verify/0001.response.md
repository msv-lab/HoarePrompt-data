### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes the lists `a`, `b`, and `xx` as described. This ensures that the input is properly parsed and stored.

2. **Counting Known Transitions**:
   - The program iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each scenario based on the characters 'F' and 'S'. This step is crucial for identifying scenarios with known transitions and is implemented correctly.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively. This step is also implemented correctly and helps in making decisions about the remaining transitions.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Scenarios**:
   - The program decides the transitions for the remaining scenarios based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sa` and assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and their corresponding transitions. For all other transitions, it assigns 'S'.
   - If `len(sb) > len(sa)`, it appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sb` and assigns 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and their corresponding transitions. For all other transitions, it assigns 'F'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the new transition plan, ensuring that the matrix remains symmetric and that the known transitions are respected.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by only modifying the '?' characters and keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged. This is crucial and is correctly handled.

- **Consecutive Transitions**:
  - The program's logic for distributing the transitions is based on the assumption that by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb`, it will prevent more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type. However, this logic is not robust enough to guarantee the condition for all permutations of scenarios.
  - For example, consider a scenario where `n = 12` and the input matrix has a few known 'F' and 'S' transitions. The program might assign 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest. If the player visits these scenarios in a specific order, it could still result in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles small values of `n` (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`) correctly by ensuring that the known transitions are respected and the remaining transitions are assigned in a way that does not violate the symmetry and the consecutive transitions condition. However, the logic for larger `n` is not sufficient to guarantee the condition for all permutations.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee that the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will be satisfied for all permutations of scenarios. The logic for distributing the transitions is too simplistic and does not consider the overall sequence of transitions for all possible permutations. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
