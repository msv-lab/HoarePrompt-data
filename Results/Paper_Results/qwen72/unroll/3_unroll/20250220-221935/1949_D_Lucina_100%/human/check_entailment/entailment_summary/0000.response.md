Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n` lines of input, forming a symmetric matrix `xx` of characters.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row (and column) of the matrix.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
   - The program iterates through the matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' character.
   - This ensures that the program knows which scenarios have already been decided as funny or scary.

3. **Identifying Partially Decided Scenarios**:
   - The program identifies scenarios that have only 'F' transitions (stored in `sa`) and scenarios that have only 'S' transitions (stored in `sb`).
   - This step helps in deciding the type of transition videos for the remaining undecided scenarios.

4. **Deciding the Remaining Transitions**:
   - If there are more or equal scenarios with 'F' transitions (`sa`) than with 'S' transitions (`sb`), the program:
     - Adds any remaining scenarios (those with no transitions decided yet) to the `sa` list.
     - Replaces '?' with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in the `sa` list and with 'S' for the rest.
   - If there are more scenarios with 'S' transitions (`sb`) than with 'F' transitions (`sa`), the program:
     - Adds any remaining scenarios to the `sb` list.
     - Replaces '?' with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in the `sb` list and with 'F' for the rest.

5. **Output and Symmetry**:
   - The program constructs and prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the original symmetry is preserved.
   - The '?' characters are replaced in a way that aims to avoid more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

6. **Correctness Criteria**:
   - The program ensures that the transition videos do not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The program respects the already decided transitions and maintains the symmetry of the matrix.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- **Handling of `n // 4 - 1`**:
  - The condition `n // 4 - 1` is incorrect. It should be `n // 4` to ensure the correct number of scenarios are considered.
  - For small values of `n`, `n // 4 - 1` can be negative, which is not valid.

- **Ensuring the Correct Number of Consecutive Videos**:
  - The program's approach of replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the first `n // 4` scenarios might not always guarantee that no permutation will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
  - A more robust approach would be to ensure that the transitions are distributed in a way that no permutation can violate the constraint.

Given these issues, the program does not fully satisfy the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
