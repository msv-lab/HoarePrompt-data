### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` and initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at the beginning to make indexing easier.

2. **Counting Known Transitions**:
   - For each scenario, the program reads a line of input and updates the counts in `a` and `b` based on the characters 'F' and 'S' in the input.
   - The input is stored in `xx` for later use.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through the scenarios and appends the indices to `sa` if the scenario has at least one funny transition and no scary transitions, and to `sb` if the scenario has at least one scary transition and no funny transitions.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Scenarios**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`len(sb)`), the program proceeds to assign transitions to the remaining scenarios.
   - It first appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
   - Then, for each scenario, it constructs a new line `nx` by:
     - Keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged.
     - Assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and their corresponding transitions.
     - Assigning 'S' to all other transitions.

5. **Handling the Case with More Scary Transitions**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary transitions is greater, the program appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sb`.
   - It then constructs the new lines `nx` by:
     - Keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged.
     - Assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and their corresponding transitions.
     - Assigning 'F' to all other transitions.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the new transition plan, which should satisfy the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by only modifying the '?' characters and keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged. This is crucial because the transition from scenario `i` to `j` should be the same as from `j` to `i`.

- **Consecutive Transitions**:
  - The program attempts to distribute the transitions such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are present. However, the logic for distributing the transitions is not robust enough to guarantee this condition for all permutations of scenarios.
  - Specifically, the program only ensures that the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` have a certain type of transition, but it does not consider the overall sequence of transitions for all possible permutations.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`) by ensuring that the known transitions are respected and the remaining transitions are assigned in a way that does not violate the symmetry and the consecutive transitions condition.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee that the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will be satisfied for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
