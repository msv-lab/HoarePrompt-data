The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` is not relevant because it is set by the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
