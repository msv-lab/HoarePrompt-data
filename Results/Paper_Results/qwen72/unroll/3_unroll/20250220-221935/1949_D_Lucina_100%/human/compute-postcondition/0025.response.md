Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 24) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, forming a symmetric matrix. It counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column) and identifies rows (and columns) where only 'F' or only 'S' characters are present. The function then modifies and prints the matrix by replacing '?' characters: if there are more or equal rows with 'F' (no 'S') than rows with 'S' (no 'F'), it replaces '?' with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` rows and columns in the 'F' list, and with 'S' otherwise. If there are more rows with 'S' (no 'F') than rows with 'F' (no 'S'), it replaces '?' with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` rows and columns in the 'S' list, and with 'F' otherwise. The original input matrix and its symmetry are preserved, and the function does not return any value. **
