### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for this problem. However, the function reads input directly from `stdin`, which is a common practice in competitive programming for handling multiple test cases. This is not incorrect, but it could be more modular by accepting parameters.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and then iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and sorts this list `a`.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is based on the idea that each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and the maximum number of triangles is limited by the number of vertices chosen and the number of additional vertices you can choose.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted list `a` to find gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because this gap can form a triangle.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to a temporary list `tmp` to be processed later.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the First and Last Vertex:**
   - The function also checks the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list `a` (considering the polygon is cyclic). If this gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans`. If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to the temporary list `tmp`.

6. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The function sorts the temporary list `tmp` and then iterates over it to add as many additional vertices as possible (up to `y`) to form more triangles.
   - For each gap in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, it breaks out of the loop.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case. This is because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- It calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to the existing set of vertices chosen by Bessie.
- The logic for handling gaps and adding additional vertices is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
