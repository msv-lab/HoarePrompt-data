The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is not properly defined, but this does not affect the loop head. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `tt` must be greater than 0 and `ii` is now 0.

State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
