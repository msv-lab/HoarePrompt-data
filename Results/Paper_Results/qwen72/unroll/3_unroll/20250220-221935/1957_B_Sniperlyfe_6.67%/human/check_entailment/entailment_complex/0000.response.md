### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` and appends the result to a list `results`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range `n` and sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
     - `k.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary, excluding leading zeros.
     - `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` sets all bits up to the highest bit of `k` to 1. For example, if `k = 5` (binary `101`), `k.bit_length() - 1` is 2, and `(1 << 2) - 1` is `3` (binary `11`).
   - It subtracts the value assigned to each element from `k`.
   - After the loop, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of `nums`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, with each result being a space-separated list of integers.

### Analysis:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the elements in `nums` should be equal to `k`.
  - The function sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
  - It then subtracts this value from `k` for each element, and finally adds the remaining `k` to the last element.
  - This ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly `k`.

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s in the Binary Representation:**
  - The bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
  - By setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the function ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
  - Adding the remaining `k` to the last element does not change the fact that the bitwise OR of all elements will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `k` is less than `n`, the function will set each element to 0 and then add `k` to the last element, which is correct.
  - If `k` is exactly `n`, the function will set each element to 1, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Correctness:
**True**
