The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list `a` must satisfy 0 <= a_i < n. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns different outputs based on the input:
- Case_1: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 2 * 10^5, or if any element `a_i` in the list `a` is not within the range 0 to n-1, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_2: If the input is valid, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to the list and the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, and handles multiple test cases. It returns an error message if `n` is out of the valid range or any element in `a` is not within the range 0 to n-1. If the input is valid, it processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to `a` and `n`.**
