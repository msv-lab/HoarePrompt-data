The only variables in the loop head are `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` should start at 0 (the first iteration of the loop).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- For each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0, and `t` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
