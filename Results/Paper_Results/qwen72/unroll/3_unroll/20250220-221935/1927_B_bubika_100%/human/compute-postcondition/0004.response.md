Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user for a specified number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. It then generates a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet string `a` and increments a counter for each character used. The function prints the generated string `r` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, `t` is decremented to 0, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5. **
