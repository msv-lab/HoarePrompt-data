Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t has been decremented by 1 for each iteration), n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (unchanged), a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' (unchanged). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 (unchanged), and for each test case, a valid string r is generated from the input string s.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is used as the loop counter and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0 if it started at 1, or it will be `t - 1` if it started at a value greater than 1.
- The variable `n` is read from input for each test case and remains unchanged within the loop.
- The string `a` remains unchanged as it is used to map indices to characters.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, which remains unchanged.
- For each test case, the string `r` is generated based on the input string `s` and the array `b`. The final value of `r` is printed for each test case.
