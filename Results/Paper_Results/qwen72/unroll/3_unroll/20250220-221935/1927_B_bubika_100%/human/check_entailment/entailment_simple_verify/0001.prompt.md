You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 (unchanged), and for each test case, a valid string r is generated from the input string s.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `s` using `int(input())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))`, respectively.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - The program uses a string `a` containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - It also uses an array `b` of length 26, initialized with zeros, to keep track of the count of each letter used.

3. **String Reconstruction:**
   - For each element `i` in the trace array `s`, the program finds the index `x` in `b` where the value is equal to `i` using `b.index(i)`.
   - It then appends the corresponding letter from `a` to the result string `r`.
   - After appending the letter, it increments the count at index `x` in `b` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the reconstructed string `r` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Trace Array Interpretation:**
  - The trace array `s` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the current character at each position.
  - For example, if `s[i] = 0`, it means the character at position `i` has not appeared before.
  - If `s[i] = 1`, it means the character at position `i` has appeared once before, and so on.

- **Finding the Correct Index:**
  - The program uses `b.index(i)` to find the first index in `b` where the value is `i`. This ensures that the character chosen has the correct number of previous occurrences.
  - For example, if `i = 1`, the program will find the first index in `b` that has a value of 1, and use the corresponding letter from `a`.

- **Incrementing the Count:**
  - After appending the letter to `r`, the program increments the count at the found index `x` in `b`. This updates the count of the chosen letter for future positions.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly by printing a single letter 'a' (since the trace array will be `[0]`).
  - The program also handles the case where all elements in the trace array are 0 by printing a string of the same letter repeated `n` times (e.g., `aaaaaaa` for `n = 8`).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace array `s` for each test case. It ensures that the trace array constraints are met by using the count array `b` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter.

### Correctness:
**True**
