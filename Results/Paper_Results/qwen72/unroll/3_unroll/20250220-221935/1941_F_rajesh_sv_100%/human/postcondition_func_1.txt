The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It returns the result of `func` when called with the arguments in `args`. If `args` is not a key in the dictionary `d`, it adds `args` as a key and sets the value to the result of `func(*args)`. If `args` is already a key in `d`, it returns the existing value associated with `args` without modifying `d`.
