(n, m, k) are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. D is a sorted list of unique integers, representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= len(D) <= m and 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. F is a list of k integers, representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= len(F) <= k and 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9.
