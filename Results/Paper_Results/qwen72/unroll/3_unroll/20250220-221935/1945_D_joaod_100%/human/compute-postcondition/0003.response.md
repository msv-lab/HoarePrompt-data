The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue.
  - `m`: an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person.
  - `b`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i.

The function returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is not possible for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts the number of people in the queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill `m`, a list of costs to bribe each person `a`, and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions `b`. It returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is not possible, it returns -1.**
