The function `func` reads a series of game scenarios from user input, processes each scenario to determine the winner (Alice, Bob, or Draw) based on the initial positions of their chips and the board dimensions, and prints the result for each scenario. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console. After the function concludes, the list `answers` contains the results of all the game scenarios, and these results have been printed to the console.
