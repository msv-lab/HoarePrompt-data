The function `func` should accept parameters `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. `h` and `w` represent the height and width of the board, respectively, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips. The constraints are: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`.

The function returns a result based on the game logic, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, and return a result based on the game's rules.

Functionality: **The function accepts the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. It returns a result based on the game's rules.**
