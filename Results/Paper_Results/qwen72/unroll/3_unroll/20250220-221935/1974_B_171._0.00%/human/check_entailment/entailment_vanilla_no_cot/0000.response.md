Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The decoding process should reverse the encoding process, where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r` (constructed from the distinct, alphabetically sorted characters of the original string `s`). However, the function `func_1` in the program is attempting to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a character that has not yet been used in the mapping, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r from the encoded string
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from characters in r to their symmetric counterparts
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i+1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This version correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct, alphabetically sorted characters of the encoded string. It then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart and uses this mapping to decode the string.
