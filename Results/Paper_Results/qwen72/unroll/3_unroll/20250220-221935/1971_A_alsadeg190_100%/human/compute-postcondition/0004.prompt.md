You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, and they satisfy 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `x` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `x` and `y` from the input. If `x` is less than `y`, it will print `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it will print `y` and `x` in that order. After the loop finishes, the value of `x` will be the last value of `x` read from the input, and the value of `y` will be the last value of `y` read from the input. The value of `i` will be `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers satisfying 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
