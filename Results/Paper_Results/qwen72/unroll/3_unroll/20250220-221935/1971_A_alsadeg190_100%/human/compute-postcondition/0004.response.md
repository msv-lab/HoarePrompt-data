Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the input, then iterates `x` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. It prints the smaller of the two integers first, followed by the larger one. After the function completes, the value of `x` will be the last value of `x` read from the input, and the value of `y` will be the last value of `y` read from the input. The function does not return any value. **
