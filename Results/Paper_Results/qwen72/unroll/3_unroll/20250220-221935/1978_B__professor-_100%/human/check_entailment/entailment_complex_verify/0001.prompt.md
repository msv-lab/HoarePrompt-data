You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b are unchanged. However, the loop has printed the result of the conditional statements for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated result for each of the `t` test cases. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and the program state is as it was before the function call, except for the printed outputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the maximum profit:
     - **Condition 1:** `if b <= a`
       - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
       - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif b - a >= n`
       - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
       - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
       - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`.
     - **Condition 3:** `else`
       - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means the optimal `k` is somewhere between 0 and `n` where the modified price `b` is greater than `a` but the difference `b - a` is less than `n`.
       - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
       - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
       - The profit from the remaining buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `b <= a`, selling all buns at `a` is the best strategy.
   - **Condition 2:** If `b - a >= n`, selling all buns at the modified price is the best strategy.
   - **Condition 3:** If `b - a < n`, the optimal `k` is `b - a`, and the profit is calculated as described.

4. **Checking the Formulas:**
   - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is correct.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series is also correct.
   - The profit from the remaining buns is correctly calculated as `a * (n - (b - a))`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their minimum or maximum values correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `b` is exactly equal to `a` or where `b - a` is exactly equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases described in the problem. The logic and formulas used are accurate for calculating the maximum profit.

### Correctness:
**True**
