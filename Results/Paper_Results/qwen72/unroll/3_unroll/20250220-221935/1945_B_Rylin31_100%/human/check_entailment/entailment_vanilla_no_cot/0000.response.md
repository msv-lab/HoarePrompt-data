Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program calculates the sum of the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within the visibility duration `m` and then adds 2. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between the two installations, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Period Overlap**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time, which means we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The LCM of `a` and `b` can help us determine the first time both installations launch a firework simultaneously. This is important because it can lead to a higher number of fireworks being visible at the same time.

3. **Visibility Calculation**: For each time `t` from 0 to `m`, we need to count how many fireworks from each installation are visible at that time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
    # Calculate the LCM of a and b
    l = lcm(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period
    count_a = (m + a) // a
    count_b = (m + b) // b
    
    # Calculate the number of overlapping launches within the visibility period
    count_overlap = (m + l) // l
    
    # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
    max_visible = max(count_a, count_b) + min(count_a, count_b) - count_overlap
    
    return max_visible

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))
```

### Explanation:
1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor, and the `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Fireworks**: 
   - `count_a` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `count_b` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `count_overlap` calculates the number of times both installations launch a firework simultaneously within the visibility period `m`.

3. **Maximum Visible Fireworks**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation minus the number of overlapping launches.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the visibility periods and overlaps, leading to the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
