Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, the logic used in the program is flawed. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` using integer division (`m // a` and `m // b`). It then adds 2 to the sum of these values, which is incorrect.

### Correct Logic:
To determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, we need to consider the following:
1. **Fireworks from the same installation:** Since each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, the maximum number of fireworks from a single installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1` for the first installation and `m // b + 1` for the second installation.
2. **Fireworks from both installations:** We need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. The key is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which will help us determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

### Correct Calculation:
- The maximum number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1`.
- The maximum number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // b + 1`.
- The maximum number of fireworks from both installations that can be visible at the same time is `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

However, the program simply adds 2 to the sum of `m // a` and `m // b`, which does not account for the overlap correctly.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `6 7 4`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct because the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is indeed 2.
- For the input `3 4 10`, the program outputs `7`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 7, but the program's logic does not guarantee this.
- For the input `7 8 56`, the program outputs `17`, which is correct, but the logic is still flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility periods for fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
