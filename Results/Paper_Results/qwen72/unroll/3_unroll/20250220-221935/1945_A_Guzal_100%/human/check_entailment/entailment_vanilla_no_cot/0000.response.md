Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. This condition is incorrect because it does not properly account for the possibility of using universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.
   - The correct approach should be to first allocate tents for introverts (since they must be alone), then try to fill the tents for extroverts, and finally use the remaining universals to fill any remaining spots.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the constraints of extroverts needing exactly 3 people in a tent.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents for introverts is `a`.

2. **Extroverts:**
   - Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need `b // 3` tents to accommodate as many extroverts as possible.
   - The remaining extroverts are `b % 3`. We need to check if there are enough universals to fill these remaining spots. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts, and we should output `-1`.

3. **Universals:**
   - After accommodating introverts and extroverts, the remaining universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in the tents or form their own tents.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        k += a  # Tents for introverts
        if b % 3 != 0:
            if b % 3 + c < 3:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                c -= (3 - (b % 3))  # Use universals to fill the remaining spots
        k += b // 3  # Tents for extroverts
        if b % 3 != 0:
            k += 1  # One additional tent for the remaining extroverts and universals
        k += (c + 2) // 3  # Tents for the remaining universals
        print(k)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Introverts:** Each introvert gets a separate tent, so we add `a` to the total number of tents.
- **Extroverts:** We first allocate `b // 3` tents for the extroverts. If there are remaining extroverts (`b % 3`), we check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If not, we output `-1`. If there are enough universals, we use them to fill the remaining spots and subtract the used universals from `c`.
- **Universals:** The remaining universals can be used to form their own tents. We use the formula `(c + 2) // 3` to calculate the number of tents needed for the remaining universals.

This corrected program should handle all the cases correctly as per the problem statement.
