The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
