### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` represents the number of introverts, each of whom needs a tent alone.
   - `b` represents the number of extroverts, each of whom needs to share a tent with exactly two others.
   - `c` represents the number of universals, who can be placed in any tent configuration.

3. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `k` to 0, which will store the total number of tents required.
   - It first checks if it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts. This is determined by the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3`. If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for the extroverts, and the function prints `-1`.
   - If the above condition is not met, the function proceeds to calculate the number of tents required:
     - `k += a` accounts for the tents needed for introverts.
     - `(b + c) // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be formed by extroverts and universals.
     - If there are any remaining participants after forming full tents, it adds one more tent to `k` using `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of tents `k` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3`
  - This condition checks if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for the extroverts. If `b % 3` is not zero, it means there are some extroverts who cannot form a complete tent of three. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, making it impossible to accommodate all participants.

- **Condition 2**: `(b + c) // 3`
  - This calculates the number of full tents that can be formed by extroverts and universals. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, so `(b + c) // 3` gives the number of full tents.

- **Condition 3**: `(b + c) % 3 != 0`
  - This checks if there are any remaining participants after forming full tents. If there are, one more tent is needed to accommodate them.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
  - `b % 3 = 2` and `b % 3 + c = 5` (which is >= 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 1 + (2 + 3) // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 2`, so `k += 1` making `k = 3`.
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Example 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
  - `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 2` (which is < 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is true.
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
  - `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 3` (which is >= 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 1 + (4 + 2) // 3 = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 0`, so no additional tent is needed.
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Example 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
  - `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 2` (which is < 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is true.
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
  - `b % 3 = 0`, so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 1 + (3 + 2) // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 2`, so `k += 1` making `k = 3`.
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Example 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
  - `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 19` (which is >= 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 19 + (7 + 18) // 3 = 19 + 8 = 27`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 2`, so `k += 1` making `k = 28`.
  - Output: `28` (Correct)

- **Example 7**: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`
  - `b % 3 = 0`, so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 0 + (0 + 0) // 3 = 0`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 0`, so no additional tent is needed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 8**: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`
  - `b % 3 = 0`, so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 7 + (0 + 0) // 3 = 7`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 0`, so no additional tent is needed.
  - Output: `7` (Correct)

- **Example 9**: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`
  - `b % 3 = 0`, so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 0 + (24 + 0) // 3 = 8`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 0`, so no additional tent is needed.
  - Output: `8` (Correct)

- **Example 10**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
  - `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 1000000001` (which is >= 3), so the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false.
  - `k = 1000000000 + (1000000000 + 1000000000) // 3 = 1000000000 + 666666666 = 1666666666`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 2`, so `k += 1` making `k = 1666666667`.
  - Output: `1666666667` (Correct)
