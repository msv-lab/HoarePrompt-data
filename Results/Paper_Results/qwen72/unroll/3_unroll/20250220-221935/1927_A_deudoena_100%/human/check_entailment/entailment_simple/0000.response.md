Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle each test case individually. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but the problem description suggests that it should take the number of test cases and a list of tuples as parameters. This is a mismatch between the function's intended use and its actual implementation.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input directly using `input()`, which is not ideal if it is supposed to be called multiple times within a loop. Each call to `func_1` should be independent and should not rely on global input.

3. **Logic for Finding the Segment**:
   - The variable `c` is used to find the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
   - The variable `d` is used to find the position of the last 'B' in the string `s`.
   - The return value is calculated as `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the position of the last 'B' and `mi` is the position of the first 'B'. However, the correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length should include both the first and last 'B' positions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` consists of only 'B' characters, the program will return 2, which is incorrect. It should return the length of the string `s`.
   - If the string `s` consists of only 'W' characters, the program will return 2, which is incorrect. It should return 0, but the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

5. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to calculate the minimum segment length should be `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. The function should be modified to take the necessary parameters and use the correct formula for calculating the segment length.

Correctness: **False**
