Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white when there are multiple segments of black cells that are not contiguous.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
WBBWWB
```
The correct output should be 3, as the minimum segment to paint is from the 2nd to the 4th cell (inclusive), which would turn the strip into "WWWWWW". However, the provided program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1()`. The program calculates the positions of the first and last black cells (`mi` and `ma` respectively) and then returns `ma - mi + 2`. This approach does not account for the possibility that the minimum segment to paint might be shorter if there are multiple segments of black cells that are not contiguous. The correct approach would be to find the first and last black cells and return the length of the segment between them, inclusive.
