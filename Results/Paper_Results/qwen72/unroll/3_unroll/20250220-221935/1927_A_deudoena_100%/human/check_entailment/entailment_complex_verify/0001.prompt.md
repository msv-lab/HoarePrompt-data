You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':

- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found) + 1, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the program returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the user. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the function returns 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip itself `s`.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. The list `l` is also initialized but not used in the function.
   - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right to find the position of the first black cell (`'B'`). It increments `c` for each cell and sets `mi` to `c` when it encounters the first black cell.
   - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left to find the position of the last black cell (`'B'`). It increments `d` for each cell and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` when it encounters the last black cell.
   - The function returns the length of the segment that needs to be painted white, which is calculated as `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic of finding the first and last black cells is correct.
   - The segment length is calculated as `ma - mi + 2`, which should actually be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment includes both the first and last black cells.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the strip consists of only one black cell, the program will correctly return 1.
   - If the strip consists of only black cells, the program will correctly return the length of the strip.
   - If the strip has black cells at both ends, the program will correctly return the length of the segment from the first to the last black cell.

5. **Error in Calculation:**
   - The segment length calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. It should be `ma - mi + 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a minor error in the segment length calculation. It should return `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`. This error will cause the program to output an incorrect length for the segment that needs to be painted white.
