Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first and last positions of 'B' in the string and then calculates the length of the segment to be painted. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that there might be a smaller segment that can be painted to turn the entire strip white.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that includes all the black cells ('B'). This can be done by finding the first and last positions of 'B' in the string and calculating the distance between them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_b = s.find('B')
    last_b = s.rfind('B')
    return last_b - first_b + 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It finds the first occurrence of 'B' using `s.find('B')` and the last occurrence of 'B' using `s.rfind('B')`.
   - The minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted is the distance between the first and last 'B' plus one, which is calculated as `last_b - first_b + 1`.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white for each test case.
