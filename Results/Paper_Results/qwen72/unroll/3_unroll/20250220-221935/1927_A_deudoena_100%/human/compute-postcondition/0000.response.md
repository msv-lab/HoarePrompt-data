Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black.
```
ma = mi = 0
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The variables `ma` and `mi` are both initialized to 0. The initial state does not specify any values for `ma` or `mi`, so this initialization sets their values explicitly. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**
