Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of integers `nums` and a series of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The function identifies contiguous segments of the same integer in `nums` and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if there is a valid segment boundary within the range `[l, r]` and prints the indices of the segment boundary. If no valid boundary exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program includes the list `nums` with an additional `-1` appended, the list `arr` containing the segment boundaries, and the variables `N`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` (if defined) retaining their final values. **
