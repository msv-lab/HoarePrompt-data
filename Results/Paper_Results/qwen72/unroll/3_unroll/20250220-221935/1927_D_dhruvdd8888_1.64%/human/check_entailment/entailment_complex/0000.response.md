Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but it is not defined with any parameters. This is a potential issue because the function should take the list of integers `a` and the list of queries as inputs. However, the function reads these inputs directly from `sys.stdin`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` from the input.
   - It then reads the number of queries `q` and processes each query.
   - The function appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases, which is a reasonable approach.

3. **Segment Identification**:
   - The function identifies contiguous segments of the same integer in `nums` and stores these segments in the list `arr`. Each tuple in `arr` contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - The loop that constructs `arr` correctly identifies the boundaries of each segment and appends them to `arr`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the function uses `bisect_left` to find the leftmost segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks if the segment boundaries are within the query range:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the segment boundary.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` because no valid pair exists.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it prints the indices of the segment boundary.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the segment boundaries are at the limits of the query range.
   - The additional `-1` appended to `nums` helps in handling the end of the array.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each query, which is consistent with the problem description.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Global Variables**:
  - The function `func_1` uses global variables like `ppp` and `tc`, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass these as parameters or use local variables.

- **Segment Boundary Check**:
  - The condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` are used to determine if the segment boundaries are within the query range. However, the logic for determining the indices to print is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if s > l` should be checked more carefully to ensure that the indices are within the query range.

- **Query Range Validation**:
  - The function should ensure that the indices `l` and `r` are within the valid range for the array `nums`.

Given these points, the function is mostly correct but has some logical issues in handling the segment boundaries and query ranges.

Correctness: **False**

The function needs to be revised to correctly handle the segment boundaries and query ranges. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums.append(-1)
    arr = []
    s = 0
    num = nums[0]
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((s + 1, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        if eli < len(arr) and arr[eli][0] <= r and arr[eli][1] <= r:
            s, e, _ = arr[eli]
            if s > l:
                print(s - 1, s)
            else:
                print(s, e)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for ppp in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

This revised function should correctly handle the segment boundaries and query ranges.
