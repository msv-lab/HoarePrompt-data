Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Structure**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, but `func_1()` is not defined to handle multiple test cases. It should be defined to handle each test case individually.
   - The function `func_1()` should be called within the loop that iterates `tc` times, and the function should read the input and process each test case.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` redefines `input` as `sys.stdin.readline`, which can cause issues if `input` is used elsewhere in the code.
   - The input handling inside `func_1()` is not consistent with the problem description. For example, it appends `-1` to the `nums` array, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Logic Issues**:
   - The logic for finding the pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i \ne a_j` is flawed. The program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the range of indices, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the elements in the range are all the same or different.
   - The conditions for printing the results are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all elements in the range are the same or when the range is very small (e.g., `l == r`).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Read the input for each test case.
- For each query, check if there are any two different elements in the specified range.
- If such a pair exists, print the indices. If not, print `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def find_pair(nums, l, r):
    seen = set()
    for i in range(l-1, r):
        if nums[i] in seen:
            return l-1, i+1
        seen.add(nums[i])
    return -1, -1

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        i, j = find_pair(nums, l, r)
        print(i, j)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`find_pair` Function**: This function takes the array `nums` and the query range `l` and `r`. It uses a set to track seen elements and returns the first pair of indices where `a_i \ne a_j`. If no such pair exists, it returns `-1, -1`.
- **Main Loop**: The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the array and the number of queries, then processes each query by calling `find_pair` and printing the result.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases.
