You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of integers `nums` and a series of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The function identifies contiguous segments of the same integer in `nums` and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if there is a valid segment boundary within the range `[l, r]` and prints the indices of the segment boundary. If no valid boundary exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program includes the list `nums` with an additional `-1` appended, the list `arr` containing the segment boundaries, and the variables `N`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` (if defined) retaining their final values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly. The program defines `func_1` but calls it inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, which is incorrect because `func_1` is not defined to take any arguments.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The `input` function is redefined inside `func_1`, which can cause issues if the program is run in an environment where `input` is not available or is used elsewhere.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program uses a binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a number in the array, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains multiple different numbers within the query range.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the query range contains only one unique number. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the current logic does not handle this case correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the query range is very small (e.g., `(1, 2)` in an array with two identical elements) or where the query range is the entire array.

5. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not always output the correct indices for the elements. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output any pair of different elements, but the current logic may not always provide a valid pair.

To demonstrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output is:
```
-1 -1
```

However, the program will not correctly handle this case and may output incorrect indices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
