### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The program appends a `-1` to the end of the array `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a valid approach to ensure that the last segment of identical elements is processed.
   - It then iterates through the array to group consecutive identical elements into a list of tuples `arr`. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the group.
   - This step is intended to help quickly find the boundaries of different elements in the array. The logic here is correct and efficient.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first group that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks if the start of the group is greater than `l` and if the end of the group is less than `r`.
   - If the start of the group is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous group and the first element of the current group. This is a correct approach to find a pair of different elements.
   - If the end of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no different elements exist in the range. This is also correct.
   - If the end of the group is less than `r`, it prints the indices of the first element of the current group and the first element of the next group. This is correct as well.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for `ppp == 23`, which is not necessary for the problem and can be ignored.
   - The program also includes a condition `if tc > 5` to skip some queries, which is not part of the problem requirements and can lead to incorrect results. This is a significant logical error.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The condition `if tc > 5` is a logical error because it skips some queries without processing them, leading to incorrect output. This means that for test cases where `tc > 5`, the program will not process all queries, which is against the problem requirements.
   - The program does not handle the case where the range `l` to `r` contains only one unique element correctly. It should check if there are any different elements within the range. However, the current logic does not account for this scenario properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the logical error in the query handling and the unnecessary conditions, the program is incorrect. The condition `if tc > 5` causes the program to skip processing some queries, which is not allowed by the problem description. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the range `l` to `r` contains only one unique element.

Final: **False**
