Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program initializes a variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position, it checks the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the template at this position must be an uppercase letter that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `c` does not match the template at this position, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the template at this position can be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template at this position, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop continues to the next position.

3. **Output**: After processing all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement and the example. Therefore, the program is correct.
