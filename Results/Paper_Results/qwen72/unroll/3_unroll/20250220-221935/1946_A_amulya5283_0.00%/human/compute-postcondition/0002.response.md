Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.**
