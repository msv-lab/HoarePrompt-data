You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop iterates through `t` test cases, and for each test case, it processes the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. After the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variables `b` and `s` are modified within the loop but are reset for each new test case. The variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are used to calculate the scores for each test case and are reset for each new test case. The output state for each test case is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` and the arrays `p` and `a`.

2. **Adjusting Positions**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is necessary for accessing elements in the arrays `p` and `a`.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - On each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the current score and the remaining turns.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible score for each player. It should not be using `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` to determine the maximum score. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores based on the positions and the array `a`.

2. **Position Update**:
   - The position update logic is correct, but the score calculation logic is flawed.

3. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, but the program incorrectly decrements `k` inside the loop and breaks when `k` reaches 0. This is not necessary and can be simplified.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for j in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score calculation and unnecessary complexity in the loop.
- The corrected program correctly simulates the game by updating the positions and scores for each turn and then comparing the final scores.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
