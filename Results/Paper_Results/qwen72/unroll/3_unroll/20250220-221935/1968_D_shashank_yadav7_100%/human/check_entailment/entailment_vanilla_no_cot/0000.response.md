Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the sum of the scores they can accumulate by moving to different positions. However, the logic for calculating these scores is flawed.
   - The program uses `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which incorrectly assumes that the score can be recalculated based on the remaining number of turns (`k`). This is not how the game works. The score should be accumulated based on the actual positions the players move to over the course of the game.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` is used to simulate the game for `k` turns, but it iterates over the length of the permutation `n` instead of the number of turns `k`. This can lead to incorrect results if `k` is less than `n`.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect. The positions should be updated directly using `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]` without subtracting 1, as the positions are already 0-indexed after the initial `-1` adjustment.

4. **Incorrect Score Accumulation**:
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated inside the loop, but the program also attempts to update `bm` and `sm` in a way that does not reflect the actual game rules. The scores should be accumulated based on the actual positions the players move to, not by recalculating them in each iteration.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, you should:
- Simulate the game for exactly `k` turns.
- For each turn, update the scores based on the current positions and then move to the new positions as specified by the permutation `p`.
- After `k` turns, compare the final scores to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust positions to 0-indexed
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the new position
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the new position
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Key Changes:
- The loop now runs for exactly `k` turns.
- The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` (which should be `p[b]` and `p[s]` if the input permutation is 1-indexed).
- The scores are accumulated correctly based on the current positions.

This corrected program should now correctly determine the winner of the game for each test case.
