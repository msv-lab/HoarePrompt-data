Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to simulate the "Permutation game" as described. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are initialized to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as the players start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` and their scores are immediately increased by `a[P_B]` and `a[P_S]`.

2. **Loop for Game Turns**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, which is correct as the game lasts for `k` turns.
   - However, the loop decreases `k` by 1 in each iteration, which is not necessary and can lead to confusion. Instead, a fixed loop like `for _ in range(k):` would be clearer and more appropriate.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program updates `bm` and `sm` using the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining turns, which is not necessarily the case. The correct approach should be to simulate each turn and update the scores accordingly.
   - The program should simulate the movement of both players for each turn and update their scores based on the current position and the next position in the permutation.

4. **Movement Simulation**:
   - The program correctly moves the players to the next position in the permutation using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`. However, the `- 1` is unnecessary because the positions are already 0-indexed in Python.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - The final comparison of `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner is correct in concept but incorrect in implementation due to the flawed score calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            bp += a[b]  # Update Bodya's score
            sp += a[s]  # Update Sasha's score
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: Convert `P_B` and `P_S` to 0-indexed positions and initialize `bp` and `sp` with the initial scores.
- **Loop for Game Turns**: Simulate the game for `k-1` turns (since the first turn is already accounted for in the initial scores).
- **Movement and Score Update**: Move the players to the next position in the permutation and update their scores based on the new positions.
- **Final Comparison**: Compare the final scores and print the result.

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical and implementation issues that make it incorrect. The corrected version addresses these issues and should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
