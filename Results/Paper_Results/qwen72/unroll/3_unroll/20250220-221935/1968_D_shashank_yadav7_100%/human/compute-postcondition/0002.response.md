Output State: **The loop iterates through `t` test cases, and for each test case, it processes the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. After the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variables `b` and `s` are modified within the loop but are reset for each new test case. The variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are used to calculate the scores for each test case and are reset for each new test case. The output state for each test case is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.**
