Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Character Strings**:
   - The program correctly identifies that a string of length 1 cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, as the only possible substring is the string itself, which is a palindrome. It prints 'NO' and continues to the next test case.

2. **Check for First and Last Characters**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is already non-palindromic. The program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself. This is correct because a non-palindromic string can be considered a valid partition with one part.

3. **Check for All Characters Being the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly prints 'NO' because any substring of such a string will also be a palindrome. This is a valid check and the output is correct.

4. **Check for One Different Character**:
   - If the string contains exactly one different character, the program checks if the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. If the string length is odd and the different character is in the middle, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself. This is correct because a string with one different character can be non-palindromic if the different character is not in the middle.

5. **General Case for Multiple Different Characters**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself. This is correct because the presence of at least one pair of different characters ensures that the string is not a palindrome.
   - If the first pair of different characters is found but the string cannot be split into two non-palindromic substrings, the program attempts to find a valid split by keeping track of the positions of different characters. If a valid split is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (2) and the substrings. If no valid split is found, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as strings with all characters the same and strings with exactly one different character correctly.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the string length is 2 and the characters are different, printing 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself.

7. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as described. It prints the correct output format for each test case, either 'YES' with the number of parts and the substrings or 'NO'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and edge cases, and it produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
