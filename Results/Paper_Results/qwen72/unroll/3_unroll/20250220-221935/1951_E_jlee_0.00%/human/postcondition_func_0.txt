The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different, or if the string contains at least two different characters. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
