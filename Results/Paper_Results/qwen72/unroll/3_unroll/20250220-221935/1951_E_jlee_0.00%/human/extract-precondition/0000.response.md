Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def partition_non_palindromes(t, test_cases):
```

With the correct precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and test_cases is a list of strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 10^6.**
