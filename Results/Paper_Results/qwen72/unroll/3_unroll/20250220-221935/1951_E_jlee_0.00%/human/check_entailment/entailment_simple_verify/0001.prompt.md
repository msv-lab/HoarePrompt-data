You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has only one character, it is a palindrome by definition, so the program correctly prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the string is not a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

4. **All Characters Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the string is a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "NO".

5. **Almost All Characters Same:**
   - If all characters except one are the same, the program checks if the string can still be a palindrome. If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the string to find the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it continues to check for a valid partition by finding the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first character `x`.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" with the partition.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Single Character String:**
  - The program correctly handles this case by printing "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.

- **First and Last Character Different:**
  - The program correctly handles this case by printing "YES" with the entire string as the partition because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

- **All Characters Same:**
  - The program correctly handles this case by printing "NO" because a string with all characters the same is a palindrome.

- **Almost All Characters Same:**
  - The program correctly handles this case by checking if the string length is odd and the middle character is different. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **General Case:**
  - The program iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
  - If no such pair is found, it continues to check for a valid partition by finding the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first character `x`.
  - The logic for finding the partition is complex but seems to cover most cases where a valid partition can be found.

### Edge Cases:

- **String with All Characters the Same:**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" for such strings.

- **String with Different First and Last Characters:**
  - The program correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **String with One Different Character:**
  - The program correctly handles this case by checking the middle character for odd-length strings and ensuring the partition is valid.

- **String with Multiple Different Characters:**
  - The program correctly finds a valid partition by checking the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first character `x`.

### Conclusion:

The program seems to handle all the edge cases and general cases correctly. It follows the logic described in the problem and ensures that the output is valid for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
