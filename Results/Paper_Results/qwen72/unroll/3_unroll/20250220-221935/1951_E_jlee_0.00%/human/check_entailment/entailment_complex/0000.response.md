### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a string `s`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has only one character, it correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the function correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is valid because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the function correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, the function checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It correctly handles the case where the middle character is different (for odd-length strings) and prints "NO" if the middle character is the only different one. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

6. **General Case:**
   - For the general case, the function iterates through the first half of the string and checks for the first position where the characters at the start and end are different. If such a position is found, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If no such position is found, it checks for the first position where a character different from the first character is found. It then attempts to partition the string into two substrings and prints "YES" with the partition if it finds a valid partition. If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The function correctly handles all the edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the string is partitioned into non-palindromic substrings if possible and prints the appropriate output.

**Correctness: **True****

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- It checks for the simplest cases first (single character string, all characters the same, almost all characters the same).
- For more complex cases, it iterates through the string to find a valid partition.
- The function ensures that the output is correct for each test case and terminates after processing all test cases.
