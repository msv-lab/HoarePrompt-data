You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

For n=6 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where 1 <= t <= 50, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function then prints pairs of integers: (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for each `i` from 3 to `n`. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `n` for each test case remain as they were, and the output consists of the printed pairs for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for every potential case. For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\). The program outputs the following points:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-1| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 5, as shown in the problem description:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-3| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, but the optimal size is 5. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
