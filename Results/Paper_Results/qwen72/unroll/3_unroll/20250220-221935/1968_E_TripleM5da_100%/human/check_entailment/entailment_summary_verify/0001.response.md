### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution starts by printing the cell \((1, 1)\).
   - It then prints the cell \((1, 2)\).
   - For the remaining \( n-2 \) cells, it prints the cells \((i, i)\) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Distances:**
   - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1 \).
   - For the remaining cells \((i, i)\) where \( i \) ranges from 3 to \( n \):
     - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) is \( |1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1) \).
     - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) is \( |1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1) - 1 \).
     - The distance between \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( i < j \) is \( |i - j| + |i - j| = 2(j - i) \).

4. **Checking for Distinct Distances:**
   - The distances \( 2(i - 1) \) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \) are distinct and range from 4 to \( 2(n-1) \).
   - The distances \( 2(i - 1) - 1 \) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \) are distinct and range from 3 to \( 2(n-1) - 1 \).
   - The distances \( 2(j - i) \) for \( i < j \) are distinct and range from 2 to \( 2(n-2) \).

5. **Maximizing the Set \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all the distinct distances calculated above.
   - The distances \( 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2(n-1) \) are all distinct and cover a range of \( 2(n-1) + 1 \) values.
   - This means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( 2(n-1) + 1 \), which is the maximum possible size for the set of distinct Manhattan distances in an \( n \times n \) grid.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution correctly prints \( n \) cells that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - The distances between these cells are distinct and cover the maximum possible range.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly prints the cells that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) by ensuring that all possible distinct Manhattan distances are covered. The reasoning provided in the original assessment is correct, and the function summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given inputs.
