### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) grid and need to choose \( n \) cells such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution starts by printing the cell \((1, 1)\).
   - It then prints the cell \((1, 2)\).
   - For the remaining \( n-2 \) cells, it prints the cells \((i, i)\) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Distances:**
   - The first two cells are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The Manhattan distance between these two cells is \( |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1 \).
   - For the remaining cells \((i, i)\) where \( i \) ranges from 3 to \( n \):
     - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) is \( |1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1) \).
     - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) is \( |1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1) - 1 \).
     - The distance between \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( i < j \) is \( |i - j| + |i - j| = 2(j - i) \).

4. **Checking for Distinct Distances:**
   - The distances \( 2(i - 1) \) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \) are distinct and range from 4 to \( 2(n-1) \).
   - The distances \( 2(i - 1) - 1 \) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \) are distinct and range from 3 to \( 2(n-1) - 1 \).
   - The distances \( 2(j - i) \) for \( i < j \) are distinct and range from 2 to \( 2(n-2) \).

5. **Maximizing the Set \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all the distinct distances calculated above.
   - The distances \( 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2(n-1) \) are all distinct and cover a range of \( 2(n-1) + 1 \) values.
   - This means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( 2(n-1) + 1 \), which is the maximum possible size for the set of distinct Manhattan distances in an \( n \times n \) grid.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution correctly prints \( n \) cells that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - The distances between these cells are distinct and cover the maximum possible range.
