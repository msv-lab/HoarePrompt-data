The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where 1 <= t <= 50, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function then prints pairs of integers: (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for each `i` from 3 to `n`. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `n` for each test case remain as they were, and the output consists of the printed pairs for each test case.
