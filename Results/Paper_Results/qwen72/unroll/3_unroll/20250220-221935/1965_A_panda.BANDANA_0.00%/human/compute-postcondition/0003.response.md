The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each inner list in `piles` contains `n` integers, where `n` represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the number of stones in each pile.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the number of stones in each pile for the corresponding test case.**
