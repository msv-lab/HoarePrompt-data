Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing the piles of stones for a test case.
