The function `func_1` processes a single string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for the longest substring within `s` that can be repeated consecutively, considering question marks as wildcards that can match any character. If such a substring is found, it prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such substring is found, it prints `0` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function has printed either a value representing twice the length of the longest repeatable substring or `0`.
