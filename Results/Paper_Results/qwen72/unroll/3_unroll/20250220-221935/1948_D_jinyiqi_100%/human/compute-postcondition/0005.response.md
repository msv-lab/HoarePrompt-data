The function `func_1` is expected to be called with a string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The string `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and its length is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The integer `t` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and an integer `t`. It processes `t` test cases, where each `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with a length between 1 and 5000. The function returns a result based on the processing of these strings, ensuring that the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
