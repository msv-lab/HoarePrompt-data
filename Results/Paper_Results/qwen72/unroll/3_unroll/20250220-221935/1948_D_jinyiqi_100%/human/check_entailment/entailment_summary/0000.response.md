Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **String Processing**: The function `func_1()` converts the input string `s` into a list, which allows for easier manipulation of individual characters. This is a good approach since strings in Python are immutable.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The program checks for the longest possible tandem repeat by iterating from the largest possible half-length down to 1. This is a valid approach because a tandem repeat must be of even length, and the longest possible tandem repeat would be the largest even number less than or equal to the length of the string.

4. **Wildcard Handling**: The program correctly handles question marks (`?`) as wildcards. If either of the characters being compared is a `?`, or if the characters are the same, the count is incremented. This ensures that the program considers all possible ways to replace the `?` to form a tandem repeat.

5. **Count and Print**: If the count reaches the current half-length `j`, the program prints `2 * j` and returns, indicating that a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found. If no tandem repeat is found, the program prints `0`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the string contains no tandem repeats correctly by printing `0`.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:

- **Return Statement in Loop**: The return statement inside the loop for checking tandem repeats might cause the function to terminate prematurely if a valid tandem repeat is found. This could be a problem if there are multiple valid tandem repeats of the same length, and the function should ideally check all possible substrings of that length before returning.

Despite this potential issue, the program seems to work correctly for the given examples and the problem constraints. The approach of checking from the largest possible tandem repeat down to the smallest ensures that the first valid tandem repeat found is the longest possible one, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.

Correctness: **True**
