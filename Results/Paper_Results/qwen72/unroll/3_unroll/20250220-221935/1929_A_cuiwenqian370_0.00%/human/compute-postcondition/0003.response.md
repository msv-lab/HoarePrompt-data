Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1.**

The value of `right` is now set to `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. All other variables remain unchanged.
