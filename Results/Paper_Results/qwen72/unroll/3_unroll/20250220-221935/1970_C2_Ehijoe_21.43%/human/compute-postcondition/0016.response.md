Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` remain unchanged. `nodes` remains a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing the nodes it is connected to. `start` is now an input integer. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is False. `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection (i.e., their list has a length of 1). `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`. If any element in `moves` is an odd number, then at least one element in `moves` is odd. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.***
