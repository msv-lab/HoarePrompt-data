### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered active.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round, given that both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It returns a list of distances.
   - If the starting node has no adjacent nodes (or all adjacent nodes are the parent node), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for each child node and increments them by 1.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the starting node.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The function checks if any of these distances are odd.
   - If any distance is odd, Ron wins the round. If all distances are even, Hermione wins the round.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - In a tree, the game can be analyzed based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - If there is at least one odd distance, Ron can always make a move to an odd-distance node, and Hermione will be forced to make a move to an even-distance node, eventually leading to a situation where Hermione cannot make a move.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that Ron is the one who cannot make a move.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is correctly read and the tree is correctly constructed.
   - The starting node is correctly identified.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly called to compute the distances.
   - The output is correctly determined based on the parity of the distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Both functions work together to achieve the desired result, and the logic for determining the winner is sound.

Correctness: **True**
