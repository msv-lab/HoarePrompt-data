The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from input, where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `t` is always 1. It then reads `n-1` pairs of integers representing edges and constructs a `nodes` dictionary where each key is a node and each value is a list of its neighbors. The function initializes a deque `leaves` with all nodes that have exactly one connection. It reads another integer `start` from input, which is a node in the range `1 <= start <= n`. The function calls `func_1` with `nodes` and `start`, and based on the result, prints either 'Ron' if any move is odd or 'Hermione' if all moves are even. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, `start` is the input node, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is False, `leaves` contains all nodes with exactly one connection, and `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.
