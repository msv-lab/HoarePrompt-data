The function `func_1` accepts parameters `nodes`, `start`, and `parent`. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node. If the starting node has no adjacent nodes (or all adjacent nodes are the parent node), it returns a list containing a single element, which is 0. Otherwise, it returns a list of distances, each incremented by 1, representing the distances from the starting node to its adjacent nodes and their descendants. The input `nodes` dictionary or list remains unchanged.
