The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` that specifies the number of test cases. Each of `n` and `k` are positive integers with a range from 1 to 10^18, and `t` is an integer with a range from 1 to 1000. The function is expected to process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
