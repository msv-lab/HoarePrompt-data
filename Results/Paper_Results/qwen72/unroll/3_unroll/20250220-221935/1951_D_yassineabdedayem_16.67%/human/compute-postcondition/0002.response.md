Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are the final values after the loop's operations, `rep` is the number of iterations performed (up to 60), `number` is the last value appended to `tab`, and `tab` is a list of strings representing the numbers generated during the loop. If `k` is 0, the loop prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the contents of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the loop prints 'NO'.**
