Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by distributing the coins and jewels across the stalls, but there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Logic Issue**: The logic for determining the price of each stall and the number of jewels Alice will buy from each stall is flawed. The program tries to set the price and the number of jewels in a way that doesn't guarantee Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the conditions and calculations for `Min` and `Max` are not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions `(Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))` and the subsequent checks are not appropriate for the problem. The program should focus on ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, not on complex calculations involving `Min` and `Max`.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is not correct. The program should print the prices of the stalls on the third line, but it is printing the number of jewels bought from each stall instead.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `n` is very small compared to `k` or when `k` is 1.

A correct approach would be to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the stalls in a way that she can buy one jewel from each of the first `k` stalls, and the remaining stalls can have prices that are too high for her to buy any more jewels. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            print(n // k, end=' ')
        print()
        n -= k * (n // k)
        if n > 0:
            print(n, end=' ')
        for _ in range(60 - k):
            print(10**18, end=' ')
        print()

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If `k` is greater than 60, it prints "NO" because Bob cannot set up more than 60 stalls.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls with a price of `n // k` each, ensuring Alice buys one jewel from each of these stalls.
- The remaining coins are used to set up the last stall (if any coins are left), and the remaining stalls are set to a very high price (`10^18`) to ensure Alice cannot buy any more jewels.

This approach guarantees that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and the output format is correct.
