The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If there is any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `x`, and `l` being updated for each iteration, but `n` retains its initial value after the function concludes.
