The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`. The integer `n` represents the number of friends, and the list `p` contains `n` integers, each representing a friend's preferred invitation number. The constraints are that `n` is between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element `p_i` in the list `p` is between 1 and `n`, inclusive, with `p_i` not equal to `i` and all `p_i` being distinct. The function returns the minimum number of invitations required to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.
