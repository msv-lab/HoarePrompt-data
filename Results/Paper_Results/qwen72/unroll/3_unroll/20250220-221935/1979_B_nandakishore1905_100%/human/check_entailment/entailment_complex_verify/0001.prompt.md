You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: The values of x and y remain unchanged. The loop processes each pair of integers (n, m) provided as input and prints a specific value based on the conditions described in the loop. The loop does not modify x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes a series of pairs of integers (n, m) provided through standard input. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints 1. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it performs additional calculations to find the largest power of 2 less than `k` and prints the result of subtracting this power of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sequences \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).
   - The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these sequences.
   - A common subsegment is a sequence of consecutive elements that appear in both \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequences \(a\) and \(b\) are generated by XORing the index \(n\) with constants \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning \(a_n \oplus b_n = (n \oplus x) \oplus (n \oplus y) = x \oplus y\).
   - The value \(x \oplus y\) is a constant for a given pair \((x, y)\).

3. **Finding the Longest Common Subsegment:**
   - For \(a_i\) and \(b_j\) to be equal, \(i \oplus x = j \oplus y\).
   - Rearranging, we get \(i \oplus j = x \oplus y\).
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the number of consecutive integers \(k\) such that \(i \oplus (i+1) \oplus (i+2) \oplus \ldots \oplus (i+k-1) = x \oplus y\).

4. **Properties of XOR:**
   - The XOR of a sequence of consecutive integers \(i, i+1, \ldots, i+k-1\) is periodic with a period of 2.
   - Specifically, the XOR of \(i\) and \(i+1\) is 1, and the XOR of \(i, i+1, i+2, i+3\) is 0.
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is the largest power of 2 that divides \(x \oplus y\).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It calculates \(k = |n - m|\).
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2 (i.e., \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\)), it prints \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \(k\) is even, it finds the largest power of 2 that divides \(k\) by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) until \(k\) becomes a power of 2.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies if \(k\) is a power of 2 and prints \(k\) if it is.
   - If \(k\) is odd, the longest common subsegment is 1, which is correctly printed.
   - If \(k\) is even, the program correctly finds the largest power of 2 that divides \(k\) and prints it.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided.

Correctness: **True**
