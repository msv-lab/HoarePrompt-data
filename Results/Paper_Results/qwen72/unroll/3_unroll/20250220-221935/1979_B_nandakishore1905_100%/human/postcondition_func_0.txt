The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes a series of pairs of integers (n, m) provided through standard input. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints 1. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it performs additional calculations to find the largest power of 2 less than `k` and prints the result of subtracting this power of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables.
