### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If a different element is found, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - It then resets `same` to 1 and continues the iteration.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array consists of all the same elements, the program should output -1 because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking if `minn` remains `inf` after the loop, which means all elements were the same.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove if it is possible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - If it is not possible (i.e., all elements are the same), it prints -1.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program increments `i` twice in the else block, which might skip elements. This is incorrect because it should only increment `i` once after finding a different element.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element, which should also output -1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it increments the index `i` in the else block.
- The corrected program handles the edge case where the array has only one element.
- The corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs -1 if it is impossible.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the index increment issue and the missing edge case for a single-element array.)
