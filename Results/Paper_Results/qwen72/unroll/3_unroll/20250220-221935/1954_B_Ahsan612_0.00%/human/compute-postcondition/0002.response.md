The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that is guaranteed to be beautiful. The total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the result for each one.**
