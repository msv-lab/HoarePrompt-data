You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that is guaranteed to be beautiful. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]

        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, processes the array, and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed, and the output for each test case has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the array and prints this value. If no such consecutive elements exist, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with all test cases having been processed and their respective results printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If a different element is found, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - It then resets `same` to 1 and continues the iteration.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array consists of all the same elements, the program should output -1 because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking if `minn` remains `inf` after the loop, which means all elements were the same.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove if it is possible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - If it is not possible (i.e., all elements are the same), it prints -1.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program increments `i` twice in the else block, which might skip elements. This is incorrect because it should only increment `i` once after finding a different element.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element, which should also output -1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it increments the index `i` in the else block.
- The corrected program handles the edge case where the array has only one element.
- The corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs -1 if it is impossible.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the index increment issue and the missing edge case for a single-element array.)
