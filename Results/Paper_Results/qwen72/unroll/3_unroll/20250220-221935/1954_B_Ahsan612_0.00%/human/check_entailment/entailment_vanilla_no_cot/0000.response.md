Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not account for the conditions required to determine if an array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. However, this does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires identifying elements that can be replaced by the operation and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent this operation from being possible.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program incorrectly increments `i` by 1 when it encounters a different element, which can lead to skipping elements that should be considered.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely composed of the same element, as it should output `-1` in such cases.

3. **Output for Non-Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program does not correctly determine if it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful. It should output `-1` if the array is already non-beautiful or if it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

A correct approach would involve:

- Checking if the array is composed entirely of the same element. If so, output `-1`.
- Identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the operation from being possible. This involves finding the shortest subarray where the operation can be applied and ensuring that removing elements from this subarray will make the array non-beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
        
        # If no such element is found, the array is already non-beautiful
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(0)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version checks if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` if they are. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the operation from being possible. If no such element is found, it outputs `0` because the array is already non-beautiful.
