Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function prints 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified and remain as they were read from input. **
