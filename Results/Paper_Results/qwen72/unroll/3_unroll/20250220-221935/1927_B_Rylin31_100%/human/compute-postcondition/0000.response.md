To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given program state and the loop head:

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- For the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `i` is not explicitly given before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
   - The state of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if the user input is a positive integer.
- The variable `i` will start at 0.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
