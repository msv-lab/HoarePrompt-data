The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` representing the length of the list, and then reads a list of integers `array`. It generates a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a character in the alphabet, starting from 'a', and prints this string. The list `s` is used to track the number of times each index in `array` has been encountered, and it is updated accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
