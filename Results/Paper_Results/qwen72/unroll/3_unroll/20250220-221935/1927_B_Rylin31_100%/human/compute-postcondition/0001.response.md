Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. For the given trace, there exists a suitable string s. The loop has executed all iterations, and the variable `ans` has been printed for each iteration, containing a string formed by mapping each integer in the input array to a character in the alphabet, starting from 'a'. The list `s` has been updated to reflect the number of times each index in the array has been encountered.**
