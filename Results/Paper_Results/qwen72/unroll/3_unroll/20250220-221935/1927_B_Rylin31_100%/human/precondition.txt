t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and traces is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n) representing the trace of a string of length n (1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace, a suitable string s exists.
