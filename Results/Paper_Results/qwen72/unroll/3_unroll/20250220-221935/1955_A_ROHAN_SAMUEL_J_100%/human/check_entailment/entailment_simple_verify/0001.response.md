### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The output should be the minimum cost for each test case.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd or even:
     - If `n` is odd:
       - It compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
     - If `n` is even:
       - It again compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - The program should print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
     - Output: `9` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - The program should print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - Output: `14` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - The program should print `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
     - Output: `15` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - The program should print `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.
     - Output: `20` (Correct)

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - It correctly compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually with the promotion price.
   - It calculates the minimum cost based on the comparison and the parity of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all the provided test cases and edge cases correctly.

Final: **True**
