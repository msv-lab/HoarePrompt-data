The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might operate on or with external inputs or variables that include an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and for each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30). The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return a result based on these inputs.

Since the function's return value is not explicitly provided, I will describe the expected functionality based on the typical use case for such parameters. The function is likely designed to process a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
