You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.

    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs the value of `ans` which is calculated based on the initial conditions and the logic within the loop. The value of `ans` will be either the factorial of `n` if `k` is sufficiently large (i.e., `k >= n * m`), or a product of differences between the adjusted values in the list `a` if `k` is smaller. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are reset for each test case, so their final values are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` (where `m` is the minimum value in `a`), `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as a product of differences between the adjusted values in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are reset for each test case, so their final values are not retained after the loop completes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum score. Specifically, the logic for updating the number of cards and the final score calculation is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Min Calculation and Initial Check**:
   ```python
   m = min(a)
   if k >= n * m:
       ans = math.factorial(n)
   ```
   This part of the code checks if the number of coins `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, where `m` is the minimum number of cards of any type. If this condition is true, it sets the answer to `math.factorial(n)`. However, this logic is incorrect because it assumes that if `k` is large enough, you can always form `math.factorial(n)` subarrays, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Updating the Number of Cards**:
   ```python
   k -= n * m
   for i in range(n):
       a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
       k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
   ```
   This part of the code attempts to update the number of cards of each type by adding a certain number of new cards. However, the logic for how many cards to add is flawed. The expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` does not correctly account for the distribution of cards to maximize the score.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   ```python
   ans = a[0]
   for i in range(1, n):
       ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
   ```
   This part of the code calculates the final score by multiplying the differences between the number of cards of each type. This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
The expected output is `15`, but the program will produce a different result.

- **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
  - `n = 3`, `k = 4`, `a = [6, 1, 8]`
  - `m = min(a) = 1`
  - `k >= n * m` is `4 >= 3 * 1` which is true, so `ans = math.factorial(3) = 6`
  - The program will print `6`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves a more sophisticated algorithm to distribute the coins optimally and count the number of valid subarrays. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for many cases.
