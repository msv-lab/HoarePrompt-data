### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all cyclic shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the positions where a '0' appears after a '1', which are the points where a cyclic shift is needed to move the '0' to the left of the '1's.
   - The cost of each shift is calculated as `one + 1` because:
     - The substring to be shifted includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
     - The length of this substring is `one + 1`.
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of all such shifts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "000"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) for each string, where n is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(1) since only a few variables are used.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the string "10":
     - The algorithm will shift the entire string once, resulting in a cost of 2.
   - For the string "0000":
     - The algorithm will not perform any shifts, resulting in a cost of 0.
   - For the string "11000":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, each with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 9.
   - For the string "101011":
     - The algorithm will perform two shifts, one with a cost of 3 and one with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 5.
   - For the string "01101001":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, one with a cost of 3, one with a cost of 2, and one with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 11.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `s` is a binary string (consisting of only '0's and '1's) with a length of 2 to 200,000 characters.
- **State of the program inside the function:**
  - `cost` is initialized to 0.
  - `one` is initialized to 0.
  - The loop iterates through each character in `s`.
  - If the character is '1', `one` is incremented.
  - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is incremented by `one + 1`.
- **State of the program at the end of the function:**
  - `s` remains unchanged.
  - `cost` is the total number of '0's in `s` multiplied by the number of '1's before each '0' plus the number of '0's.
  - `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`.
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the total cost calculated.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the necessary cyclic shifts and calculates their costs. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
