You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting of only '0's and '1's) with a length of 2 to 200,000 characters.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` remains unchanged, `cost` is the total number of '0's in `s` multiplied by the number of '1's before each '0' plus the number of '0's, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of '0's in `s` multiplied by the number of '1's before each '0' plus the number of '0's.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns a value that represents the total number of '0's in `s` multiplied by the number of '1's that appear before each '0', plus the total number of '0's in `s`. The input string `s` remains unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all cyclic shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The algorithm works by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the positions where a '0' appears after a '1', which are the points where a cyclic shift is needed to move the '0' to the left of the '1's.
   - The cost of each shift is calculated as `one + 1` because:
     - The substring to be shifted includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
     - The length of this substring is `one + 1`.
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of all such shifts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "000"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) for each string, where n is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(1) since only a few variables are used.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the string "10":
     - The algorithm will shift the entire string once, resulting in a cost of 2.
   - For the string "0000":
     - The algorithm will not perform any shifts, resulting in a cost of 0.
   - For the string "11000":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, each with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 9.
   - For the string "101011":
     - The algorithm will perform two shifts, one with a cost of 3 and one with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 5.
   - For the string "01101001":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, one with a cost of 3, one with a cost of 2, and one with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 11.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by identifying the necessary cyclic shifts and calculating their costs. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as expected.
