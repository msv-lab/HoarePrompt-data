Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is '1', it increments `one` by 1.
   - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.
   - Finally, it returns `cost`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Understanding the Problem:**
  - The goal is to sort the binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's).
  - The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

- **Algorithm Explanation:**
  - The algorithm works by counting the number of '1's before each '0'. Each time a '0' is encountered, it adds the number of '1's before it plus 1 to the cost.
  - This is because to move a '0' to the correct position, all '1's before it must be shifted to the right, and the '0' itself must be shifted to the left.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost should be 0, which the program correctly handles.
  - If the string has no '0's or no '1's, the cost should also be 0, which the program correctly handles.

- **Example Verification:**
  - For the string "10", the cost is 2 because the entire string is shifted.
  - For the string "0000", the cost is 0 because it is already sorted.
  - For the string "11000", the cost is 9, which is correct as explained in the problem statement.
  - For the string "101011", the cost is 5, which is correct:
    - "101011" -> "110101" (cost 2)
    - "110101" -> "111010" (cost 3)
    - Total cost: 2 + 3 = 5
  - For the string "01101001", the cost is 11, which is correct:
    - "01101001" -> "00110101" (cost 4)
    - "00110101" -> "00011011" (cost 3)
    - "00011011" -> "00001111" (cost 4)
    - Total cost: 4 + 3 + 4 = 11

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic and the examples provided in the problem statement are consistent with the output of the program.

Correctness: **True**
