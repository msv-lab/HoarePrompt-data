Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions (`n`, `m`), the positions of the goals (`rg`, `bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and the players (`player`).
   - It reads the field configuration and stores the positions of the entities in the appropriate variables.

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of steps (`T`) and processes each step one by one.
   - For each step, it correctly identifies the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - The actions are handled as follows:
     - **Catch Action (C)**: The player catches the Quaffle, and the `carry` variable is updated to reflect this.
     - **Throw Action (T)**: The player throws the Quaffle, and the `carry` variable is reset. The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
     - **Movement Actions (U, D, L, R)**: The program calls `func_1` to update the position of the entity (Quaffle, Bludger, or player) based on the direction of movement.
     - **Bludger Movement**: After moving the Bludger, `func_2` is called to check if any player has been eliminated by the Bludger and to handle the elimination.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement.
   - It handles all four directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the coordinates accordingly.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination events in the required format and order.
   - The eliminated players' positions are set to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are no longer on the field.

5. **Score Calculation and Output**:
   - The program correctly updates the scores when a player scores a goal.
   - It prints the score events in the required format.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score in the required format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal by awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger and prints the events in the correct order.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified actions and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
