Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `out` contains the player IDs that were equal to `blud`. The values of these players in the `player` dictionary have been set to `[-1, -1]`. The loop prints the current time step `t`, the player ID `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED' for each player ID in `out`, in ascending order.**
