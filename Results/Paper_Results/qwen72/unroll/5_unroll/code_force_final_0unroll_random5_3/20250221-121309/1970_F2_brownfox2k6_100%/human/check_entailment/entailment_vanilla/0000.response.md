### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a grid (N x M) where players (R0-R9, B0-B9), goals (RG, BG), a Quaffle (.Q), and a Bludger (.B) are placed.
   - Players can move (U, D, L, R), catch the Quaffle (C), or throw it (T).
   - If a player moves to the same cell as a Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring occurs when a player leaves the Quaffle at the opponent's goal.
   - The Quaffle resets to the center of the field after a goal.
   - The output should include events (goals, eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an object (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction (U, D, L, R).
     - It correctly modifies the position of the object by changing the row or column index.
     - The function is correct and will handle the movement of entities as described.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
     - It appends the player's identifier to a list `out` if they are in the same cell as the Bludger.
     - It then sorts the list `out` and prints the elimination events.
     - The function correctly handles the elimination of players and ensures that the events are printed in alphabetical order.

3. **Missing Components:**
   - The provided program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - There is no main function or logic to handle the entire game, including:
     - Reading the input.
     - Initializing the grid and entities.
     - Processing the actions.
     - Checking for scoring events.
     - Updating the score.
     - Printing the final score.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement or the scoring logic.
   - It does not check if a player is in the same cell as a goal and scores.
   - It does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal.
   - It does not print the scoring events or the final score.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to handle the entire game as described in the problem. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
