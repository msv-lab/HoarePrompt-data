### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch where two teams (Red and Blue) compete to score points by placing the Quaffle in the opponent's goals.
   - The game is played on a rectangular grid with specific rules for movement, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - Players can be eliminated if they come into contact with a Bludger.
   - The final score and events (goals and eliminations) need to be printed in the correct order.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player or ball) based on the direction given.
     - It correctly handles the four possible directions: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).
     - The function modifies the position of the entity in place, which is appropriate for the problem.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly identifies and prints the eliminated players in alphabetical order.
     - The function also updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - The provided code only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle movement and elimination, respectively.
   - The main logic for the game, including scoring, catching the Quaffle, and handling the Quaffle's position after a goal, is not provided.
   - The program does not handle the initial setup of the field, the Quaffle's position, or the goals.
   - The program does not print the final score or the events in the correct format.

4. **Missing Components:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The initial positions of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger need to be read from the input and stored.
     - The positions of the goals also need to be stored.
   - **Game Loop:**
     - The program needs to iterate through the actions and update the positions accordingly.
     - It should check for scoring conditions and print the appropriate events.
   - **Final Score:**
     - The program should keep track of the scores and print the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code is incomplete and does not cover all the necessary aspects of the problem.
   - While the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their specific tasks, the overall program is missing crucial parts to be considered correct.
