Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). If `d` is 'D', the first element of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `obj` remains unchanged, and `d` is not 'U', 'D', or 'L'.***
