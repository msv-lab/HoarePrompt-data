You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates the maximum integer divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `t` remains defined, but `x` and `n` are undefined. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers that sum up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the set will be maximized if the integers in the set are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `k = x // n`, which is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
   - If `k == 1`, it means the only way to distribute `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, so the GCD is 1.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to 1 and iterates over possible divisors of `x` from 1 to `sqrt(x) + 1` in steps of 2 (odd numbers only).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems.
     - If `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1`.
   - The program iterates over possible divisors of `x` to find the maximum GCD.
   - The program ensures that the chosen divisor is less than or equal to `k` to be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems.
   - The program uses the square root of `x` to limit the number of iterations, which is an efficient approach for finding divisors.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, resulting in a GCD of 1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a composite number and `n` is a divisor of `x`, resulting in a GCD greater than 1.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient by limiting the divisor search to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum GCD of the sub-problems. It handles the edge cases and uses an efficient approach to find the divisors.

### Correctness:
**True**
