You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer that is always 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):

        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list of chosen vertices, and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each iteration, so their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `T` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `list0` from the input. It sorts the list `list0` and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each test case, and the variable `T` remains unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and we are allowed to choose no more than `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices beyond those chosen by Bessie.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - We are also given a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to count the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - Finally, it prints the count of gaps plus `x - 2`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Counting Gaps of Size 1:**
     - The program correctly counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. Each gap of size 1 can form a triangle with the two vertices.
   - **Handling the Circular Nature:**
     - The program correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the last and the first vertex.
   - **Adding `x - 2`:**
     - The program adds `x - 2` to the count of gaps. This is because for `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Test Case:**
     - The program handles a single test case correctly.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The program processes multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - **Minimum and Maximum Constraints:**
     - The program works within the constraints provided (`4 \leq n \leq 10^9`, `2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)`, `y = 0`).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
     - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
     - Gaps of size 1: `(2 - 1 - 1) = 0`, `(5 - 2 - 1) = 2`, `(6 - 5 - 1) = 0`
     - Gap between last and first: `(1 + 8 - 6 - 1) = 2`
     - Total count: `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`
     - Triangles: `2 + 4 - 2 = 4` (but the correct answer is 2, as the program correctly outputs).
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
     - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
     - Gaps of size 1: `(2 - 1 - 1) = 0`, `(3 - 2 - 1) = 0`, `(4 - 3 - 1) = 0`, `(5 - 4 - 1) = 0`, `(6 - 5 - 1) = 0`, `(7 - 6 - 1) = 0`, `(8 - 7 - 1) = 0`
     - Gap between last and first: `(1 + 8 - 8 - 1) = 0`
     - Total count: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Triangles: `0 + 8 - 2 = 6` (correct output).
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
     - Sorted vertices: `[1, 3]`
     - Gaps of size 1: `(3 - 1 - 1) = 1`
     - Gap between last and first: `(1 + 4 - 3 - 1) = 1`
     - Total count: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Triangles: `2 + 2 - 2 = 2` (correct output).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. It handles the circular nature of the polygon and the constraints provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
