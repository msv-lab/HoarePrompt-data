The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The function definition and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
