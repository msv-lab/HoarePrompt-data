Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `list0` from the input. It sorts the list `list0` and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each test case, and the variable `T` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
