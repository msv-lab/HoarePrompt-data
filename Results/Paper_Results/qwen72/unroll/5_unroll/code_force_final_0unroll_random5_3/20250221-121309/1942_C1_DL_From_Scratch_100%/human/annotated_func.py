#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer that is always 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list of chosen vertices, and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each iteration, so their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `T` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `list0` from the input. It sorts the list `list0` and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each test case, and the variable `T` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
