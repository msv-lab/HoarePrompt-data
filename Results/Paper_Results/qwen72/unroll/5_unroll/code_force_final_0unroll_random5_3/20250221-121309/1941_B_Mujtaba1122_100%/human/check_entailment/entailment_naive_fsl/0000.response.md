Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Operation**: The operation in `func_2` is not correctly implemented. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. However, the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operation.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "no" directly, which is not one of the accepted outputs ("YES" or "NO").

5. **Incorrect Final Check**: The final check in `func_2` uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, but it does not handle the case where the array might not be zero after the operations.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
no
NO
```

The program incorrectly prints "no" and "NO" instead of "YES" for this valid input.
