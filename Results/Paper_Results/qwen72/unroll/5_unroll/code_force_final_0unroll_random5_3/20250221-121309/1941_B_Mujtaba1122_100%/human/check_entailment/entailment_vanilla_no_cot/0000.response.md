Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The operation in the problem description is to subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.
   - However, in `func_2`, the operation is incorrectly applied as:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
   - This is not the correct operation. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Early Termination**:
   - The function `func_2` prints 'no' and returns if `list[i - 1] != 0` after the operation. This is incorrect because it should only check if the entire array can be made zero, not just a single element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check using `func_1` is correct in principle, but the program should not print 'no' prematurely. It should only print 'YES' or 'NO' after all operations have been attempted and the final state of the array has been checked.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, it does not check if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made zero using the given operations.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(a, n):
    # Check if the sum of the array is even
    if sum(a) % 3 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if the array can be made zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] > 1 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, a in test_cases:
        if can_make_zero(a, n):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sum Check**: The function `can_make_zero` first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 3. This is a necessary condition because each operation reduces the sum by 3.
- **Operation Application**: The operation is correctly applied to the array elements.
- **Final Check**: The function checks if all elements in the array are zero using the `all` function.
- **Solve Function**: The `solve` function processes multiple test cases and collects the results.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
