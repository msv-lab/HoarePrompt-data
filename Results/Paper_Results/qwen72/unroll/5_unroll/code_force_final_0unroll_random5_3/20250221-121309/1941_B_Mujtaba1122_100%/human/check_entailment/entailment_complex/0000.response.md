### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that subtracts 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for any index `i` in the range `[2, n-1]`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_2`**: This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero by applying the operation described in the problem. It iterates over the list from index 1 to `n-2` and applies the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns. If the loop completes without early termination, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.

3. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The loop in `func_2` correctly applies the operation to reduce the elements of the list. However, there are a few issues:
     - The operation is applied in a way that `list[i-1]` is reduced to zero, but this might not be the most efficient or correct way to handle the problem. The operation should be applied in a way that ensures all elements can be reduced to zero without leaving any non-zero elements.
     - The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is too restrictive. It might prevent the function from finding a valid sequence of operations that could reduce the array to zero.
     - The function should handle cases where the elements are not initially in a state that allows the operation to be applied directly. For example, if `list[i-1]` is zero, the operation cannot be applied, and the function should check if it's possible to make `list[i-1]` non-zero by applying the operation to other indices.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where the array is already zero or where the array cannot be reduced to zero due to the constraints of the operation.
   - For example, if the array is `[0, 1, 0]`, it is impossible to reduce the array to zero because the operation cannot be applied to `i=1` without violating the conditions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is not correct because it does not handle all possible cases and might prematurely conclude that the array cannot be reduced to zero.

### Correctness: **False**
