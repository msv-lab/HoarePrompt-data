### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Operation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the operation in `func_2` is not correctly implemented. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. However, the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. This leads to incorrect modifications of the array elements and can result in negative values or incorrect reductions.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operation. For example, if the array is `[0, 0, 0]`, the program should immediately return "YES" without any operations. Similarly, if the array is `[1, 1, 1]`, it should return "NO" because it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero using the given operation.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly. For instance, if `list[i]` is 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, the loop will not execute, but the program will still check `list[i-1]` and print "no" if it is not zero, which is incorrect.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The program prints "no" directly, which is not one of the accepted outputs ("YES" or "NO"). This is a clear violation of the problem's output requirements.

5. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   - The final check in `func_2` uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, but it does not handle the case where the array might not be zero after the operations. For example, if the array is `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the program should correctly reduce all elements to zero, but it might not due to the incorrect operation implementation.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Actual Output: "no" and "NO"
  - Explanation: The program incorrectly prints "no" and "NO" because it uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, leading to incorrect reductions.

- **Test Case 2**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero, but this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Actual Output: "no" and "NO"
  - Explanation: The program fails to correctly reduce the array to zero due to the incorrect operation implementation.

- **Test Case 4**: `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero, but this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.

- **Test Case 5**: `[1, 2, 7, 2]`
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero, but this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.

- **Test Case 6**: `[7, 1, 0]`
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero, but this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.

- **Test Case 7**: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero, but this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases. The incorrect handling of the operation, potential infinite loops, and incorrect output format are major flaws that need to be addressed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
