The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition describes the state of a list and the behavior of a function, but it does not directly affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the initial state of the list or the return value of the function `func_1`.

Output: **NO**
