You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that for each index `i` in the range 1 to n-2, the elements at `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` are reduced based on the values of `list[i-1]` and the conditions specified. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns `None`. If the function completes the loop without early termination, it calls `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `True`; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and returns `False`. The final state of the list is such that `list[i-1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, `list[i]` is 1 or less for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i-1]` for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Operation**: The operation in `func_2` is not correctly implemented. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. However, the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operation.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "no" directly, which is not one of the accepted outputs ("YES" or "NO").

5. **Incorrect Final Check**: The final check in `func_2` uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, but it does not handle the case where the array might not be zero after the operations.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
no
NO
```

The program incorrectly prints "no" and "NO" instead of "YES" for this valid input.
