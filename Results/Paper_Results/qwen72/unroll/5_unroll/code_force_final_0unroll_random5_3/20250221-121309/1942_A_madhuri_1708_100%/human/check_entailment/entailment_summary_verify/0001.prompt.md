You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it processes `n` and `k` and prints an array or a `-1` based on the following conditions: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all input lines, the function finishes, and the final state of the program is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Array Constraints**: The array \( a \) should have elements \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Sorted Cyclic Shifts**: Out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of \( a \), exactly \( k \) of them should be sorted.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a file descriptor for standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - Each line is split into two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Logic for \( k \geq 2 \)**:
   - **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
     - If \( n \) equals \( k \), the program prints an array of \( n \) elements, each equal to \( k \).
     - This is correct because if \( n = k \), the array \( [k, k, \ldots, k] \) (with \( n \) elements) will have exactly \( n \) sorted cyclic shifts (since all elements are equal, every cyclic shift is sorted).
   - **Case 2: \( n \neq k \)**:
     - If \( n \) is not equal to \( k \), the program prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect. The program should not always print `-1` when \( n \neq k \). For example, if \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be \( [1, 2, 3, 1] \), which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \( [1, 2, 3, 1] \) and \( [1, 1, 2, 3] \).

4. **Logic for \( k < 2 \)**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**:
     - The program prints an array of \( n \) elements, where the \( i \)-th element is \( i + 1 \).
     - This is correct because the array \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 0 \)**:
     - The program does not handle this case explicitly, but since \( k \geq 1 \) is guaranteed by the problem constraints, this case is not relevant.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \) properly. It should be able to generate a valid array for such cases, but it always prints `-1` instead.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
