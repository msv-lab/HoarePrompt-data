Output State: The loop reads lines from the input, processes each line to extract `n` and `k`, and then prints an array based on the conditions given. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). After all iterations, the loop finishes and no further changes are made to the variables `n` and `k`. The final state of the variables `n` and `k` will be the values from the last line of input processed. The output state is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values based on the input lines. **The output state is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values based on the input lines.**
