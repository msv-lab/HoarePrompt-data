Output State: The loop reads lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers n and k. For each pair (n, k), if k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to k. If n is equal to k, it prints the list [k, k, ..., k] (k times). If n is not equal to k, it prints '-1'. If k is less than 2, it prints the list [1, 2, ..., n]. After all iterations, the variables n and k will hold the values of the last pair read from the input. The loop does not modify any other variables.
