The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, and the list `inpstr`. For the loop to execute, `inpstr` must be a non-empty string. The variables `i` and `j` are initialized by the `enumerate` function, so we don't need to adjust them directly. However, we need to ensure that the conditions for the function parameters are met, which indirectly affect the state of `inpstr`.

Given the function parameters:
- `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

For the loop to execute, the `inpstr` must be one of the strings `s` from the `test_cases` list, and it must be non-empty and contain at least one 'B' character.

State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `inpstr` is a non-empty string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `i` is 0, `j` is the first character of `inpstr`**
