Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. `inpstr` is an input string.
```
ind1 = 0
```

Output State: **`ind1` is 0, the function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. `inpstr` is an input string.**
