### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep their current wallets, followed by removing 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the player whose wallet is empty and cannot remove a coin) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins \( a + b \).
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw or Bob will win because Alice will always be the one to make the first move, and Bob can mirror Alice's strategy to ensure that Alice is the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have the advantage because she can always ensure that Bob is the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - The logic is sound because if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally, and if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided.

Correctness: **True**
