Precondition: **The function should accept two integers a and b as inputs, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
