Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it constructs the sequence `nums` to meet the problem's requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Subsequence Sum Constraints**:
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to the sequence. However, this can create a subsequence that sums to `k` if `k - nums[idx]` is already present in the sequence or if it can be formed by other elements in the sequence.
   - The program also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence, which might not be necessary and can complicate the sequence unnecessarily.

2. **Sequence Length**:
   - The sequence `nums` is constructed by starting with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This ensures that any number can be formed by a subsequence of these elements. However, the program then modifies this sequence in a way that might not guarantee the sequence length remains within the required limit of 25.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The program does not ensure that there is no subsequence of `nums` that sums to `k`.
   - The program does not ensure that for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of `nums` that sums to \(v\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach to solve this problem involves constructing a sequence that avoids forming a subsequence sum of `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. One way to achieve this is to use a combination of powers of 2 and carefully chosen additional elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]  # Start with powers of 2 up to 2^23
        if k in nums:
            nums.remove(k)  # Remove k if it is in the sequence
        else:
            # Find the largest power of 2 less than k
            idx = 0
            while (1 << idx) < k:
                idx += 1
            idx -= 1
            # Remove the largest power of 2 less than k and add k - (1 << idx)
            nums.remove(1 << idx)
            nums.append(k - (1 << idx))
        
        # Ensure the sequence length is within the limit
        while len(nums) > 25:
            nums.pop()
        
        # Print the sequence
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Sequence**: Start with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) to ensure that any number can be formed by a subsequence of these elements.
- **Remove `k` if Present**: If `k` is one of the powers of 2, remove it from the sequence to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
- **Adjust Sequence to Avoid `k`**: If `k` is not a power of 2, find the largest power of 2 less than `k` and replace it with `k - (1 << idx)`. This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
- **Trim Sequence**: Ensure the sequence length does not exceed 25 by removing excess elements if necessary.

This approach guarantees that the sequence meets the problem's requirements.
