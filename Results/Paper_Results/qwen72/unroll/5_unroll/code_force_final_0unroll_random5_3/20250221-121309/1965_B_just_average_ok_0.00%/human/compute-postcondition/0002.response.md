Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list. The `nums` list initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). After the loop, the list `nums` will have the same length as initially (24 elements), but the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) will be removed and replaced by `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and `n` and `k` will be reset for the next iteration if there are more test cases.**
