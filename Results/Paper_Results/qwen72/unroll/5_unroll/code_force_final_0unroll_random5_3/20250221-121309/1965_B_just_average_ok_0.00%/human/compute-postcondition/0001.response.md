Output State: For each test case, the loop will output the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 25, followed by the 25 elements of the `nums` list. The elements of the `nums` list will be the original 24 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)), with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed and replaced by \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variables `n` and `k` will be the last values read from the input for the final test case.
