You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list. The `nums` list initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). After the loop, the list `nums` will have the same length as initially (24 elements), but the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) will be removed and replaced by `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and `n` and `k` will be reset for the next iteration if there are more test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, and prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The modification involves removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` from `nums` and adding three new elements: `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, where `2^idx` is the removed power of 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of \( a \) sums to \( k \).
     - For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (i.e., \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23} \)).
   - It finds the largest index \( idx \) such that \( 2^{idx} \le k \).
   - It appends \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \) to the list `nums`.
   - It removes \( 2^{idx} \) from the list `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \):**
     - The program ensures that \( 2^{idx} \) is removed from the list `nums`, which is a key element in the sum \( k \). This prevents any subsequence from summing to \( k \).
     - The additional elements \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \) are chosen to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to \( k \).

   - **All Other Sums \( 1 \le v \le n \) (where \( v \ne k \)) Are Possible:**
     - The list `nums` initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can represent any number up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \) (i.e., 16777215) using subsets.
     - By removing \( 2^{idx} \) and adding \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \), the program ensures that all numbers from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be represented by some subsequence of `nums`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary elements to ensure all other sums are possible.
   - The program also ensures that the size of `nums` does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements for all valid inputs.
