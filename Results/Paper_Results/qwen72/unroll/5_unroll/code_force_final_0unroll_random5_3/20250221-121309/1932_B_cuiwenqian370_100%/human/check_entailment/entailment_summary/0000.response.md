Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `T` and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculation of the Last Year**:
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated `last_year` for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case with periodicities `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 3.
     - The second sign occurs in year 4.
     - The third sign occurs in year 8.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
   - For the second test case with periodicities `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the third test case with periodicities `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the fourth test case with periodicities `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 50.
     - The second sign occurs in year 60.
     - The third sign occurs in year 1422.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 1600.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 2012.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used is appropriate for finding the next multiple of a given periodicity that is greater than the last year.

Correctness: **True**
