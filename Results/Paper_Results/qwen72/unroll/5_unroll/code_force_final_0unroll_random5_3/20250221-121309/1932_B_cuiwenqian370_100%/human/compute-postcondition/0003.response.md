Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 0, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`.** 

The value of `T` is now the integer representation of the first element in the `data` list, which is `data[0]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
