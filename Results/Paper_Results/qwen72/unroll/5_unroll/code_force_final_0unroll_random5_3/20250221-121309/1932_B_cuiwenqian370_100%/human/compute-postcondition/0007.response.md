Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` for the final iteration, `a` is the last list of integers read from `data` for the final iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is the total number of elements read from `data` (i.e., `T + T * n`), `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list of `T` strings, each representing the last year calculated for each iteration.**
