### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple lines of input in a single read.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `T`, which is correctly read and converted to an integer.
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` for those signs. This is done correctly by slicing the `data` list and converting the elements to integers.

2. **Calculation of the Last Year**:
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the value of the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - This process is repeated for all signs, and the final `last_year` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to standard output, each on a new line, using `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by simply appending `a[0]` to the results.
   - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly, as the formula will always return the next year as `last_year + 1`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic of the program aligns with the problem description. It correctly calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
