You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers, and the function calculates the last year for each test case based on a specific formula. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` contains a list of strings, each representing the last year calculated for the corresponding test case, and these results are printed to standard output, each on a new line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases where the input is provided in a single block.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list, which is incremented as the program processes each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

3. **Sign Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. This is correct because the first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula:
- The formula \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}\) is used to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
- \(\text{last\_year} + 1\) ensures that we start looking for the next occurrence after the current year.
- \(\text{a[i]} - 1\) is added to ensure that the division rounds up to the next integer.
- The division \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right)\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1}{\text{a[i]}}\).
- Multiplying by `a[i]` converts this integer back to the corresponding year.

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case with `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{3 + 1 + 2 - 1}{2}\right) \times 2 = 4\)
  - Third sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{4 + 1 + 4 - 1}{4}\right) \times 4 = 8\)
  - Fourth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{8 + 1 + 5 - 1}{5}\right) \times 5 = 10\)
  - Fifth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{10 + 1 + 9 - 1}{9}\right) \times 9 = 18\)
  - Sixth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{18 + 1 + 18 - 1}{18}\right) \times 18 = 36\)
  - The result is `36`, which matches the expected output.

- For the second test case with `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
  - First sign: `last_year = 1`
  - Second sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{1 + 1 + 2 - 1}{2}\right) \times 2 = 2\)
  - Third sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{2 + 1 + 3 - 1}{3}\right) \times 3 = 3\)
  - Fourth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{3 + 1 + 4 - 1}{4}\right) \times 4 = 4\)
  - Fifth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{4 + 1 + 5 - 1}{5}\right) \times 5 = 5\)
  - The result is `5`, which matches the expected output.

- For the third test case with `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the result is `5`, which matches the expected output.

- For the fourth test case with `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
  - The calculation follows the same logic, and the result is `2012`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the nth sign will occur, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
