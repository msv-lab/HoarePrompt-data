### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases where the input is provided in a single block.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list, which is incremented as the program processes each test case. This ensures that the input is read correctly for each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

3. **Sign Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. This is correct because the first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The formula works as follows:
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1\) ensures that we start looking for the next occurrence after the current year.
     - \(\text{a[i]} - 1\) is added to ensure that the division rounds up to the next integer.
     - The division \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right)\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1}{\text{a[i]}}\).
     - Multiplying by `a[i]` converts this integer back to the corresponding year.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

### Example Verification:
- **First Test Case:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{3 + 1 + 2 - 1}{2}\right) \times 2 = 4\)
  - Third sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{4 + 1 + 4 - 1}{4}\right) \times 4 = 8\)
  - Fourth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{8 + 1 + 5 - 1}{5}\right) \times 5 = 10\)
  - Fifth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{10 + 1 + 9 - 1}{9}\right) \times 9 = 18\)
  - Sixth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{18 + 1 + 18 - 1}{18}\right) \times 18 = 36\)
  - The result is `36`, which matches the expected output.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - First sign: `last_year = 1`
  - Second sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{1 + 1 + 2 - 1}{2}\right) \times 2 = 2\)
  - Third sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{2 + 1 + 3 - 1}{3}\right) \times 3 = 3\)
  - Fourth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{3 + 1 + 4 - 1}{4}\right) \times 4 = 4\)
  - Fifth sign: \(\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{4 + 1 + 5 - 1}{5}\right) \times 5 = 5\)
  - The result is `5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the result is `5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - The calculation follows the same logic, and the result is `2012`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the nth sign will occur, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The annotated code and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.

Final: **True**
