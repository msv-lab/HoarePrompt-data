Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements).

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**: It calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b`.

4. **Sliding Window**: The program then slides the window across the array `a` from the first position to the last possible position (i.e., from `0` to `n - m`):
   - If the current number of matches is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.
   - It updates the frequency counter and the number of matches as the window slides:
     - Decrements the frequency of the element that is leaving the window.
     - If the frequency of the element leaving the window becomes zero, it removes the element from the counter.
     - Increments the frequency of the element that is entering the window.
     - Adjusts the number of matches accordingly.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, it performs a final check to see if the last window is good and increments the count if necessary.

This approach ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of good subarrays by maintaining a sliding window and updating the match count dynamically. The use of `Counter` helps in quickly counting and updating the frequencies, making the solution both correct and efficient.
