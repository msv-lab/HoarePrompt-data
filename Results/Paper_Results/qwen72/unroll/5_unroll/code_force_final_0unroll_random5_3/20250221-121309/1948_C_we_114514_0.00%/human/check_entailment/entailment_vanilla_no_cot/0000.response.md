Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in the way it determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Movement Simulation**: The robot should move left, right, down, or up in the first step, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The program does not correctly simulate this two-step process.

2. **Reachability Check**: The program incorrectly updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags. It does not handle the transitions between rows properly, and it does not check if the robot can move to the next column in the second row when it is in the first row and vice versa.

3. **Final Reachability**: The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by the end of the simulation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
    # Initialize the position of the robot
    row, col = 1, 0  # Start at (1, 1)
    
    # Simulate the robot's movement
    while col < n:
        if row == 1:
            if row1[col] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 2
        else:  # row == 2
            if row2[col] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 1
        if col == n - 1 and row == 2:
            return 'YES'
    
    return 'NO'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        result = can_reach_end(n, row1, row2)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the cell (2, n). It uses a while loop to move the robot step by step and updates the row and column based on the current position and the direction of the arrow. If the robot reaches the last column in the second row, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
