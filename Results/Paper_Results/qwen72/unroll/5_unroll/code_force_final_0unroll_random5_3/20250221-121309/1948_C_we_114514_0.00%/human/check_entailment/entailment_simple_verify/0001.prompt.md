You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes two boolean variables:
     - `reachable_first_row` to `True` indicating the robot starts in the first row.
     - `reachable_second_row` to `False` indicating the robot has not yet moved to the second row.
   - It iterates over each column index `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Movement Logic:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot can't move further in the first row, so it moves to the second row if the current cell in the second row points to the right (`>`).
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot can't move further in the second row, but this condition is not explicitly handled in the loop.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot has reached the last cell of the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`).
   - If so, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final Check:**
  - The final check for `reachable_second_row` should be done after the loop, but the logic inside the loop for `reachable_second_row` is flawed.
  - Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1` inside the loop is incorrect because it should be checked only after the loop has completed.

- **Movement Logic:**
  - The logic for moving from the first row to the second row and vice versa is not fully correct.
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot moves from the first row to the second row and then back to the first row.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to ensure that the robot can move between rows and columns correctly and that the final check is done after the loop.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        if not results or results[-1] != 'YES':
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is correct after the above fixes.
- **False** if the program is incorrect as originally written.
