### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes two boolean variables:
     - `reachable_first_row` to `True` indicating the robot starts in the first row.
     - `reachable_second_row` to `False` indicating the robot has not yet moved to the second row.
   - It iterates over each column index `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Movement Logic:**
   - The original program has flawed logic for handling the robot's movement between rows and columns.
   - Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1` inside the loop is incorrect because it should be checked only after the loop has completed.
   - Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot moves from the first row to the second row and then back to the first row.

5. **Corrected Movement Logic:**
   - The robot should be able to move from the first row to the second row and vice versa based on the arrows.
   - The program should check if the robot can move to the next cell in the current row or switch to the other row if possible.
   - The final check for reaching the last cell of the second row should be done after the loop.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to ensure that the robot can move between rows and columns correctly and that the final check is done after the loop.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_first_row = True
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        if not results or results[-1] != 'YES':
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Movement in the First Row:**
  - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it continues moving to the right.
  - If the robot reaches the last cell of the first row (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` to indicate it can move to the second row.
  - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot moves to the second row if the current cell in the second row points to the right (`>`).

- **Movement in the Second Row:**
  - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it continues moving to the right.
  - If the robot reaches the last cell of the second row (`j == n - 1`), it appends 'YES' to the results list and breaks out of the loop.
  - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot moves back to the first row if the current cell in the first row points to the right (`>`).

- **Final Check:**
  - After the loop, if the robot has not reached the last cell of the second row, it appends 'NO' to the results list.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed movement logic and the incorrect placement of the final check. The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
