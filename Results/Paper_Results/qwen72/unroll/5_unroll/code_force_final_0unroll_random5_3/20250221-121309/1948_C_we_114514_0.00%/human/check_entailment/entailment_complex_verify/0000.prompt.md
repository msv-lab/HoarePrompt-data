You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the second row can be reached from the first row in each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results`, where each element is a string 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether the second row can be reached from the first row for each test case in the list `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` representing arrows in a grid. The function evaluates each test case to determine if it is possible to reach the second row from the first row by moving along the arrows. It returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the second row can be reached from the first row for the corresponding test case, or 'NO' otherwise. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves to (1, 2) and follows the arrow to (2, 2).
- It then moves to (2, 3) and follows the arrow to (1, 3).
- Finally, it moves to (1, 4) and follows the arrow to (2, 4).

The robot should be able to reach (2, 4), but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". This is because the program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement along the arrows and the grid's constraints. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of the robot switching rows and continuing to move along the arrows.
