### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes two boolean variables:
     - `reachable_first_row` to `True` indicating the robot starts in the first row.
     - `reachable_second_row` to `False` indicating the robot has not yet moved to the second row.
   - It iterates over each column index `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Movement Logic:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot can't move further in the first row, so it moves to the second row if the current cell in the second row points to the right (`>`).
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot can't move further in the second row, but this condition is not explicitly handled in the loop.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot has reached the last cell of the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`).
   - If so, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final Check:**
  - The final check for `reachable_second_row` should be done after the loop, but the logic inside the loop for `reachable_second_row` is flawed.
  - Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1` inside the loop is incorrect because it should be checked only after the loop has completed.

- **Movement Logic:**
  - The logic for moving from the first row to the second row and vice versa is not fully correct.
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot moves from the first row to the second row and then back to the first row.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to ensure that the robot can move between rows and columns correctly and that the final check is done after the loop.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        if not results or results[-1] != 'YES':
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is correct after the above fixes.
- **False** if the program is incorrect as originally written.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program. The movement logic and the final check were indeed flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.

Final: **False**
