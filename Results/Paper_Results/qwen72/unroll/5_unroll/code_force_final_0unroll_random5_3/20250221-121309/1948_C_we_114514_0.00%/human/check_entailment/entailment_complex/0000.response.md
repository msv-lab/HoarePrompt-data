### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the grid size `n` and the two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows.
   - The test cases are stored in a list `test_cases`, which is then passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case and initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
   - `reachable_first_row` is initially set to `True` because the robot starts in the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initially set to `False` because the robot has not yet reached the second row.

3. **Loop Through Each Cell:**
   - The function iterates through each cell in the grid from left to right.
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`>`), the robot can potentially move to the next cell or to the second row if it is the last cell.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot cannot move to the next cell in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
     - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the left, but the arrow in the second row points to the right, the robot can move to the second row.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`>`), the robot can potentially move to the next cell or to the end of the second row if it is the last cell.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the robot can reach the last cell in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`).
   - If it can, the function appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output:**
   - The main block of the program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Incorrect Logic for `reachable_second_row`:**
  - The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if row2[j] == '>': if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` is incorrect because it does not account for the robot moving from the first row to the second row and then continuing to move right.
  - The correct logic should be to check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving right in the second row.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        
        if not reachable_second_row:
            results.append('NO')
        
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **First Row to Second Row Transition:**
  - If the robot is in the first row and encounters a left arrow (`<`), it should check if the corresponding cell in the second row has a right arrow (`>`). If it does, the robot can move to the second row.
- **Second Row to First Row Transition:**
  - If the robot is in the second row and encounters a left arrow (`<`), it should check if the corresponding cell in the first row has a right arrow (`>`). If it does, the robot can move back to the first row.
- **Final Check:**
  - The function now correctly checks if the robot can reach the last cell in the second row and appends 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the given program is correct.
- **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Given the issues identified and the corrected function, the original program is **incorrect**. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
