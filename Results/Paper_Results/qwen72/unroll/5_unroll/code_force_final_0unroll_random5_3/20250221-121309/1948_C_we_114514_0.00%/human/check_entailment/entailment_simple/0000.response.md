### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads the input for each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing the integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)`.
   - The function initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is currently on the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
         - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
         - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
         - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is currently on the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the value of `reachable_second_row`.
   - The main block prints each result in the `results` list.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for `reachable_second_row`:**
  - The logic for `reachable_second_row` is flawed. The variable `reachable_second_row` is only set to `True` if the robot is already on the second row and reaches the last column. However, the robot can also switch to the second row from the first row and then move to the last column.
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot can switch to the second row from the first row and then continue moving right.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot should be able to switch rows if it encounters a left arrow in the first row and a right arrow in the second row at the same column.
- The program should check if the robot can reach the last column in the second row by considering both rows and the possibility of switching between them.

### Correctness:
- The current program does not correctly handle the switching between rows and the movement to the last column in the second row.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
