Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **No Subarray Splitting Logic**: The program does not include any logic to split the array into subarrays. The problem specifies that the array should be split into non-empty subarrays to minimize the penalty, but the program does not handle this step at all.

3. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The program does not perform this calculation and instead just prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0`, as the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the program will output `0` because it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `0` in this case. This is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Parse the input to get the string `s`.
2. Split the string into subarrays such that the penalty is minimized.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total minimum penalty.

The provided program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
