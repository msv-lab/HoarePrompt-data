The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment with each iteration. The state of `t` and the list of tuples are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
