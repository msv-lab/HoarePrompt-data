You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string s (s_i ∈ {'+', '-'} and |s| = n).
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(P - M)
        
    #State: The loop will print the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters for each test case. The variables P and M will be reset to 0 for each new test case, so they will not retain any values from previous iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `P` and `M` are reset to 0 for each new test case, ensuring that the calculation for each test case is independent.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **No Subarray Splitting Logic**: The program does not include any logic to split the array into subarrays. The problem specifies that the array should be split into non-empty subarrays to minimize the penalty, but the program does not handle this step at all.

3. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The program does not perform this calculation and instead just prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0`, as the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the program will output `0` because it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `0` in this case. This is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Parse the input to get the string `s`.
2. Split the string into subarrays such that the penalty is minimized.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total minimum penalty.

The provided program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
