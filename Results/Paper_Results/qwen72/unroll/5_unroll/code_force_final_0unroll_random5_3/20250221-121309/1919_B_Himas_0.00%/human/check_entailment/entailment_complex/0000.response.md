Reasoning:

The program provided does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty is calculated based on the sum of the elements in each subarray and the length of the subarray. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference for each test case.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program does not implement the logic to split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty based on the sum and length of these subarrays. Instead, it calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty defined in the problem.
2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the length `n` of the string `s` but does not use it. The length `n` is not necessary for the current logic, but it is part of the input format specified in the problem.
3. **Output**: The program prints the difference `P - M` for each test case, which is not the correct output according to the problem statement. The correct output should be the minimum possible penalty.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Parse the input correctly.
- Implement a logic to split the array into subarrays in a way that minimizes the total penalty.
- Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
