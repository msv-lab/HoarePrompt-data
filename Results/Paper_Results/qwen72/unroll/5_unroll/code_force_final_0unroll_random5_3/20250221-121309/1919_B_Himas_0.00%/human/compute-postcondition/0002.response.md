The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string `s` where each character in `s` is either '+' or '-' and the length of `s` is equal to `n`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the result is based on the integer `n` and the string `s` provided in the tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters '+' or '-'. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases.**
