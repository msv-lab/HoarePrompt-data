Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2 to the result, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve finding the maximum overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by both installations. The current program does not account for the overlap correctly. For example, consider the input `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`:

- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, ...

The visibility periods for the first installation are: [6, 10], [12, 16], [18, 22], [24, 28], ...
The visibility periods for the second installation are: [7, 11], [14, 18], [21, 25], [28, 32], ...

The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (at time 7 and 14), but the program incorrectly outputs 3.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
