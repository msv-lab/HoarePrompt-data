The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself.

Since the initial state provided includes `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `t` is not directly used in the loop head, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 to make the loop execute. 

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
