Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

b = []

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

    #State: `t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single-digit number from `a` or a two-digit number from `a` split into its tens and units digits, with the tens digit appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any).
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`t`, `test_cases`, `k`, and `a` remain the same. `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0. `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0. `n` is the number of elements in `c`. `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single-digit number from `a` or a two-digit number from `a` split into its tens and units digits, with the tens digit appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any). `d` is a sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list with an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` is a list that now includes 0 as its last element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `a` derived from user input. It splits each integer in `a` that is greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, appending them to a new list `c` under specific conditions: the tens digit is appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any). Single-digit numbers from `a` are directly appended to `c`. After processing, it checks if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to include the result of the sorting check for the processed list `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `x` and `y` are set based on the last element of `a` if it is greater than 10.
