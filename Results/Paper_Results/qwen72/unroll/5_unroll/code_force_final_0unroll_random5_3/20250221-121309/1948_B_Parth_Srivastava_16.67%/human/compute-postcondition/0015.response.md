The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to process a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function should return a result for each test case based on the input values.

Since the function signature does not include any parameters, it is likely that the function is designed to read or receive the test cases from an external source (e.g., user input, a predefined list, or a file) and process them accordingly.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the input values.**
