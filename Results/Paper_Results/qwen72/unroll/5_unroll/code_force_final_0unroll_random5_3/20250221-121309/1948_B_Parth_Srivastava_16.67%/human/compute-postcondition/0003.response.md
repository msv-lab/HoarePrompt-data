Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `a` by splitting it and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0.**
