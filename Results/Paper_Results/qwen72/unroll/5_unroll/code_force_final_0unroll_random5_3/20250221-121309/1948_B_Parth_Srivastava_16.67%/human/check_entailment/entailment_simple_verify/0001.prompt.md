You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list with an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` is a list that now includes 0 as its last element.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It then iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if `y` (the tens digit) is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x` (the units digit), it appends both `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends both `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If `c` is equal to `d`, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
- The function `func_1()` correctly handles the transformation of elements greater than 10 by splitting them into digits and appending them in the correct order.
- The program checks if the transformed array `c` is sorted by comparing it with the sorted version `d`.
- The output is correctly printed based on the results stored in `b`.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
- The function `func_1()` should be called within the first loop to process each test case.
- The function `func_1()` should return the result (1 or 0) instead of appending it to `b` directly, and the result should be appended to `b` in the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    b.append(func_1())

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical structure that is mostly correct but has a few issues in the way it handles the results.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (due to the issues in handling the results, but the logic is correct and can be fixed as shown above).
