The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `a` derived from user input. It splits each integer in `a` that is greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, appending them to a new list `c` under specific conditions: the tens digit is appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any). Single-digit numbers from `a` are directly appended to `c`. After processing, it checks if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to include the result of the sorting check for the processed list `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `x` and `y` are set based on the last element of `a` if it is greater than 10.
