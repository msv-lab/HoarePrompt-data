Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares these two values and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not handle multiple test cases or accept any parameters. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` retain their input values, and the program state reflects the printed result based on the comparison of `n` and `m`. **
