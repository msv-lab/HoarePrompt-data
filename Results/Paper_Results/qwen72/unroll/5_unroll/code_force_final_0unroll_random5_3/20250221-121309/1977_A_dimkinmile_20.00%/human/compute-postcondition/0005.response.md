Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned the values of two non-negative integers provided by the user, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.***
