Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function as written only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes), which is insufficient to determine whether Nikita can achieve a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the nature of the moves:
- Each move can either add or remove 1 cube.
- After an even number of moves, the number of cubes in the tower will either remain the same (if the number of adds equals the number of removes) or change by an even number (if there is a net addition or removal of cubes).
- After an odd number of moves, the number of cubes in the tower will change by an odd number.

Therefore, for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must match the parity of `m`.

The original assessment suggests the following corrected logic:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This logic correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for Nikita to achieve a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given the examples provided in the original assessment:
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the difference `2 - 4 = -2` is even, so the correct answer is "No".
- For `n = 3` and `m = 1`, the difference `3 - 1 = 2` is even, so the correct answer is "No".

The original program would output "Yes" for both cases, which is incorrect. The corrected logic, however, would output "No" for both cases, which is correct.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw and providing the correct logic to fix it.

Final: **False**
