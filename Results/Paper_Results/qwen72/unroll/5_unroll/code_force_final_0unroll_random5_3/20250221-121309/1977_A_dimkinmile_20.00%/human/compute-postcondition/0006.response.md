The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, each constrained to 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100), and `n` and `m` are non-negative integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
