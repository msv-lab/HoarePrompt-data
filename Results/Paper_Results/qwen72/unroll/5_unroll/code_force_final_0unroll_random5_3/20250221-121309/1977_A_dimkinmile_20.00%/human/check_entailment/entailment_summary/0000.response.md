Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes). However, the problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, considering that each move can either add or remove one cube.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- If `n` is equal to `m`, then it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes by adding one cube in each of the `n` moves.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it is still possible to build a tower of `m` cubes if `n - m` is even. This is because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even to allow for the removal of cubes to achieve the exact number `m`.

The current program does not account for the evenness condition, which is crucial for the solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
