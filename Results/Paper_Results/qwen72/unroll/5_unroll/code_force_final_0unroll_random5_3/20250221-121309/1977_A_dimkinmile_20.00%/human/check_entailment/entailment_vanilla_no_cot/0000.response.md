Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct logic should consider whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, and the number of moves to reach exactly `m` cubes must be such that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the condition required to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
