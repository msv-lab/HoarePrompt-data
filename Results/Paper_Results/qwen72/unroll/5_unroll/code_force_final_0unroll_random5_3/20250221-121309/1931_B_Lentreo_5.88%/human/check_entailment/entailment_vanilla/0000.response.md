### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` containers, each with a certain amount of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container after all operations should be the average of the initial amounts.
   - Let's denote the target amount of water in each container as `target = sum(nums) // n`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
   - The program then calculates the difference between each container's water amount and the last container's water amount, and sums these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the water amounts should be equal to the last container's amount. This is not the correct approach.
   - The correct approach is to check if the water amounts can be made equal to the average amount `target`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the average amount of water `target`.
   - Check if it is possible to make all containers have exactly `target` units of water by pouring water from containers with more than `target` to containers with less than `target`.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the water amounts can be made equal to the average.
   - The program only checks if the sum of differences from the last container is zero, which is not a valid criterion for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water amounts can be made equal to the average amount. It uses an incorrect logic to check for the possibility of making all containers have the same amount of water.

Correctness: **False**
