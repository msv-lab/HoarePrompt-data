Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified operation. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Equalization Check**: The program checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero. This is not the correct condition to determine if the containers can be equalized. Instead, the correct approach is to check if the average amount of water (which is the sum of all `a_i` divided by `n`) can be achieved in each container.

2. **Handling of Non-Zero Elements**: The program only considers non-zero elements in the sum of differences, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case where all elements are zero, the program would incorrectly output 'NO' because `curr` would be zero, but the correct output should be 'YES' since all containers already have the same amount of water.

3. **Correct Condition for Equalization**: The correct condition to check is whether the sum of the differences between each element and the average amount of water is zero. If the sum of the differences is zero, it means that the total amount of water that needs to be moved to achieve equalization is balanced, and the operation can be performed to equalize the containers.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
