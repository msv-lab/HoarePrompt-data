Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issues are:

1. **Function Definition Mismatch**: The problem description implies that the solution should be implemented in a way that processes multiple test cases, but the program does not define a function `func_1(a, b)` as suggested in the comments. Instead, it directly processes the input within the main loop.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the `while` loop is flawed. The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but this does not align with the problem's requirement to add new problems with difficulty `w` and then sort and remove the last element. The program should add a new problem with a difficulty that helps in making `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

3. **Unnecessary Sorting**: The program sorts the array `a` after each insertion, which is not necessary. The problem states that the array `a` should be kept in non-decreasing order, and the insertion and removal operations should be done in a way that maintains this order.

4. **Incorrect Insertion and Removal**: The program incorrectly inserts elements from `b` into `a` and then removes the last element. This does not simulate the process of adding a new problem with a difficulty `w` and then removing the most difficult problem.

5. **Redundant Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. This function sorts an array in non-increasing order, which is not relevant to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
