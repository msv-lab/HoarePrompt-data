#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers, both of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order. However, since `arr` is not defined in the initial state, the program will raise a NameError.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list. It returns a new list that is the sorted version of `arr` in non-increasing order. If `arr` is not provided or is not a list, the function will raise a TypeError.
