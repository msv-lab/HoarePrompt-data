Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of valid triplets that can be formed from these integers, where a valid triplet is defined as a set of three numbers that are either all the same or two are the same and the third is different. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output includes the printed results for each test case. **
