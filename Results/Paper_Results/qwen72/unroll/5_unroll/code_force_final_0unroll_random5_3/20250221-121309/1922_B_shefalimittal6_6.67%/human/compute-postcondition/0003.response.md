The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `cases` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The integer `n` is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each `a_i` is constrained to the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. Each result corresponds to one test case and is determined based on the values in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the values in the corresponding inner list.**
