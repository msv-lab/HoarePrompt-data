Output State: **The variable `t` is decremented to 0, and the variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` are updated for each test case but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The output state includes the printed results for each test case, which are the values of `res` calculated during each iteration.**
