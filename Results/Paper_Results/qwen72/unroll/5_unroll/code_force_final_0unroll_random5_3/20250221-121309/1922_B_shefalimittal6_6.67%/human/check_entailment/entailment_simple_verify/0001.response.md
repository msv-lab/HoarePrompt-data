### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - A non-degenerate triangle has the property that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent `a_i`.
   - This is efficient and correctly captures the frequency of each stick length.

4. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the counts of each stick length.
   - If a stick length has a count of 3 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - If a stick length has a count of 2 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length is \( \binom{cnt}{2} \), and the number of ways to choose the third stick is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.

5. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses the `math.comb` function to calculate combinations, which is correct and efficient.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: All sticks have the same length**:
  - If all sticks have the same length \(2^a\), any three sticks can form a degenerate triangle (a triangle with zero area). However, the problem specifies non-degenerate triangles, so this case should not be counted.
  - The program correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using \( \binom{cnt}{3} \), but it should not be counted as valid for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

- **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and one stick has a different length**:
  - For a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks must be greater than the length of the longest stick.
  - If two sticks have the same length \(2^a\) and one stick has a different length \(2^b\), the condition \(2^a + 2^a > 2^b\) must hold, which simplifies to \(2^{a+1} > 2^b\) or \(a + 1 > b\).
  - The program correctly counts the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total\_sum} \).

- **Case 3: All three sticks have different lengths**:
  - For a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks must be greater than the length of the longest stick.
  - If the sticks have lengths \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) (where \(a < b < c\)), the condition \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) must hold.
  - The program does not explicitly handle this case, but it is not necessary because the combination of three different stick lengths will not form a non-degenerate triangle due to the exponential nature of the lengths.

### Issues with the Original Assessment:

- **Case 1: All sticks have the same length**:
  - The original assessment states that the program correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using \( \binom{cnt}{3} \), but this is incorrect because such a combination does not form a non-degenerate triangle.
  - The program should not count these combinations.

### Corrected Logic:

- **Case 1: All sticks have the same length**:
  - The program should not count the combinations where all three sticks have the same length.

### Final Evaluation:

The program incorrectly counts the combinations where all three sticks have the same length, which should not be counted as valid for forming a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
