You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is decremented to 0, and the variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` are updated for each test case but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The output state includes the printed results for each test case, which are the values of `res` calculated during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of valid triplets that can be formed from these integers, where a valid triplet is defined as a set of three numbers that are either all the same or two are the same and the third is different. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output includes the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for forming non-degenerate triangles with the given sticks. Specifically, the program only considers cases where there are at least two or three sticks of the same length, but it does not account for the possibility of forming a triangle with sticks of different lengths.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^4 = 16\). According to the problem description, a non-degenerate triangle cannot be formed with these lengths because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick. However, the program will incorrectly count the combinations of sticks with the same length, which does not apply here.

The program should also consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. The current implementation does not check this condition, leading to incorrect results for cases where the sticks have different lengths.
