Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given set of sticks, such that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks as a list of integers `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**:
   - **All three sticks have the same length**: This is always a valid triangle because the lengths are equal.
   - **Two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is different**: This is also always a valid triangle because the sum of the lengths of the two equal sticks will always be greater than the length of the third stick.

4. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a set of sticks of the same length.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from a set of sticks of the same length and then multiply by the total number of sticks of different lengths.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid triplets.

### Analysis:
- **Case 1**: All sticks have the same length.
  - If `cnt` (the count of a particular stick length) is 3 or more, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Case 2**: Two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is different.
  - If `cnt` is 2 or more, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks is `math.comb(cnt, 2)`.
  - The program then multiplies this by the total number of sticks of different lengths (`total_sum`), which is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.
  - This is also correctly handled by the program.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If there are fewer than 3 sticks, the program will correctly output 0 because no triangle can be formed.
  - If all sticks have different lengths, the program will correctly output 0 because no valid triangle can be formed.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `7` sticks all of length `2^1`.
  - The program correctly calculates `math.comb(7, 3) = 35` ways to choose 3 sticks.

- **Test Case 2**: `4` sticks with lengths `2^3`, `2^2`, `2^1`, `2^3`.
  - The program correctly identifies 2 valid triplets: (1st, 2nd, 4th) and (1st, 3rd, 4th).

- **Test Case 3**: `3` sticks with lengths `2^1`, `2^2`, `2^3`.
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no valid triangle can be formed.

- **Test Case 4**: `1` stick with length `2^1`.
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no valid triangle can be formed with fewer than 3 sticks.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and combinatorial calculations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
