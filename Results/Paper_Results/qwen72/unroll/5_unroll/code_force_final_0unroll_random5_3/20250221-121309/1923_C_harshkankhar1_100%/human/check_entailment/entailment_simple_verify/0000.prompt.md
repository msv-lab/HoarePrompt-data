You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases, each with an array c of positive integers and a set of queries. Specifically, the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array c and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array c. The following q lines each contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` (excluding the first element, which is 0) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The list `a` will contain cumulative sums of its original values, and the list `b` will still contain cumulative sums where each element (excluding the first element, which is 0) is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in the new `a` (after cumulative sum) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the original `a` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the differences between the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` for each query, and the final state of `a` and `b` will be the same as their state after the cumulative sums and adjustments are applied.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray is of length 1 (i.e., `x == y`). According to the problem description, a subarray of length 1 cannot be good because there cannot exist a `b_i` such that `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0`. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for such cases, which violates the problem description. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
4 4
```

The program will print "YES" for the query `4 4`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "NO" because the subarray `c[4]` is of length 1 and cannot be good.
