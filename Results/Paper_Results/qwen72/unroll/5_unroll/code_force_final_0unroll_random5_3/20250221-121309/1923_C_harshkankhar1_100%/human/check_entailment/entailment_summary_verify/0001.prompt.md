You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`, then reads the array `c`. It computes two cumulative sum lists `a` and `b`. The list `a` contains the cumulative sums of the original array `c`, while the list `b` contains cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. For each query, it checks if the difference in cumulative sums between the specified subarray in `a` is less than the difference in cumulative sums in `b` for the same subarray, or if the subarray is a single element. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values, but it prints the results of the queries directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes it.

2. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that each element `b[i]` is either 1 or 2 based on the corresponding element `a[i]` in the input array `c`.
   - Specifically, `b[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, and 2 otherwise.
   - This construction ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `a[i]`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function to create prefix sum arrays for both `a` and `b`.
   - The prefix sum array `a` stores the cumulative sum of the input array `c`.
   - The prefix sum array `b` stores the cumulative sum of the constructed array `b`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r` and checks two conditions:
     - The sum of the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]` should be greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
     - The subarray should have at least two elements (`l != r`).

5. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - The first condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]` is at least as large as the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If this condition is not met, the subarray cannot be good.
   - The second condition `x == y` ensures that the subarray has at least two elements. If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be good because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with the same sum.

6. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and constructs the necessary prefix sum arrays.
- The conditions checked in the query processing are logically sound and ensure that the subarray is good if and only if the conditions are met.
- The program correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
