The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. The input is structured as follows: the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `c`. The following `q` lines each contain two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The function processes each test case and returns the results for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. It returns the results for each query, where each query specifies a subarray of `c` defined by its borders `l_i` and `r_i`.**
