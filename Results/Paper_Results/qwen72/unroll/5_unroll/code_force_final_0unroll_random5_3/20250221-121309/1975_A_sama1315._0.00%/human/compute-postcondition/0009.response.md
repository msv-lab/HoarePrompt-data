The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `arr`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr_i <= 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `arr`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
