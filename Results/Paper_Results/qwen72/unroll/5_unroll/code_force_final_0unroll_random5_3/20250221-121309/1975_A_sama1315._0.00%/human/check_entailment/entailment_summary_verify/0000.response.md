### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a critical oversight, as the problem specifically requires this operation to be considered.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' without considering any possible splits and swaps.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies `func_1` to each set.
   - It prints the results of these function calls, each on a new line.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` will return 'No' because the array is not already sorted.
   - However, as the original assessment correctly points out, this array can be sorted by performing the specified operation:
     - Split the array into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
     - Split the array into `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]`, then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not handle the required operation of splitting and swapping the array.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases.
