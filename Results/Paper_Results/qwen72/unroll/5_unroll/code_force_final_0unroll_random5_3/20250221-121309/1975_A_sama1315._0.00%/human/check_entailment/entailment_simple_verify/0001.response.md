### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a critical oversight because the problem statement explicitly allows for such operations.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The results for each test case are collected in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is also incorrect.

3. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The state before and after the function calls is accurately described.
   - The output is correctly described as the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the function `func_1` will return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - However, this array can be sorted by splitting it into `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5]`, which can then be split and swapped again to achieve a sorted array.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for this possibility, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations of splitting and swapping parts.

### Correctness:
**False**
