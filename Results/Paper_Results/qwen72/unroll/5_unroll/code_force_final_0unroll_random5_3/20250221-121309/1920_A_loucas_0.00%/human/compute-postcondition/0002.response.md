Output State: **The variable `num` will contain an integer value that satisfies all the constraints provided in each test case, or it will remain 0 if no such integer exists. The variables `t`, `loop`, `less`, `big`, and `no` will not be part of the final output state as they are reset or redefined within each iteration of the loop.**
