Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is in the logic used to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `num` to the first valid integer found within the range and then prints `num`, instead of counting all valid integers within the range. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        min_k = float('inf')
        max_k = float('-inf')
        exclude = set()
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                min_k = min(min_k, x)
            elif a == 2:
                max_k = max(max_k, x)
            else:
                exclude.add(x)
        
        count = 0
        for k in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
            if k not in exclude:
                count += 1
        
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_k` is initialized to positive infinity to find the minimum value `k` must be greater than or equal to.
   - `max_k` is initialized to negative infinity to find the maximum value `k` must be less than or equal to.
   - `exclude` is a set to store all values that `k` must not be equal to.

2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, update `min_k` if the constraint is of type 1.
   - For each constraint, update `max_k` if the constraint is of type 2.
   - For each constraint, add the value to `exclude` if the constraint is of type 3.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - Iterate over the range from `min_k` to `max_k` (inclusive).
   - For each integer in this range, check if it is not in the `exclude` set.
   - If it is not in the `exclude` set, increment the `count`.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the `count` of valid integers for each test case.

This corrected program will accurately determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
