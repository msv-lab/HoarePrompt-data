Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct an array `a` such that for each `2 <= i <= n`, `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`. The program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then constructs subsequent elements of `a` by adding the corresponding element from `x` to the previous element of `a`.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization**: `a[0]` is set to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
2. **Construction of `a`**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to work as intended.
   - The value `a[i] mod a[i-1]` will be `x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`.

Let's verify this with the provided example:
- For the first test case:
  - `n = 4`
  - `x = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `a` is initialized as `[500, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 2 = 502`
  - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 502 + 4 = 506`
  - `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 506 + 1 = 507`
  - The output is `500 502 506 507`
  - Verification:
    - `502 mod 500 = 2`
    - `506 mod 502 = 4`
    - `507 mod 506 = 1`

This logic works for all the provided test cases and ensures that the conditions are met. The choice of 500 for `a[0]` is arbitrary but valid, as it is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

Therefore, the program is correct.
