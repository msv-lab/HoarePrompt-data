### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes the first element of the array `a` to 500. This is a valid choice since `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.

2. **Construction of `a`**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because:
     - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`
     - Therefore, `a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` by starting with `a[0] = 500` and incrementing each subsequent element by a value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which is within the allowed range.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `x`, constructs the array `a`, and prints it.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum and maximum values of `n` and `x_i` as specified in the problem description.
   - For `n = 2`, the program will correctly output `a[0] = 500` and `a[1] = 500 + x[0]`, which satisfies the condition `x[1] = a[1] \bmod a[0]`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Each element `a[i]` is within the specified range, and the modulo operation `a[i] \bmod a[i-1]` equals `x[i-1]` for all `2 \le i \le n`. The program also handles multiple test cases as required.
