The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples. Each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and each test case is guaranteed to represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result indicates whether the given square is valid based on the provided coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) that represent the corners of a square. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding test case represents a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
