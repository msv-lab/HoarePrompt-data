Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: It then prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared (`dx * dx`).

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach is correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.
