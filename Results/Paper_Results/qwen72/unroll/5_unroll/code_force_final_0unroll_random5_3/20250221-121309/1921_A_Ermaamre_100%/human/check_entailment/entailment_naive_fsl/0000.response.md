Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not in the correct order. For example, if the input coordinates are:

```
3
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```

The program will still output 9, which is correct for this case. However, if the input coordinates are:

```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still output 9, but this is incorrect because the coordinates are not in the correct order. The correct area should be 9, but the program's logic assumes that the coordinates are in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The program should first identify the correct pairs of coordinates that form the sides of the square before calculating the area.
