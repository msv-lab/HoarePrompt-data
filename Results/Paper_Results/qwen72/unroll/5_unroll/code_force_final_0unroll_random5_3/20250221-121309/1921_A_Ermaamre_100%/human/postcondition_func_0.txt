The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the user input. Each test case consists of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, the function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. It then prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared. The function does not return any value; it only prints the areas of the squares for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is not stored or modified. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be those from the last test case.
