Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It processes each test case to calculate the number of ways to form triangles using the sticks and appends these counts to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value, but the `results` list contains the number of ways to form triangles for each test case, and the `test_cases` list remains unchanged. **
