The loop head contains the variable `_` and the object `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be iterable, and in this case, it should be a list with at least one element. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and the loop iterates over the length of `test_cases`, the state of `test_cases` must be adjusted to ensure it has at least one test case.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
