The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The length of the list `test_cases` is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks, and returns "Yes" if it is possible, or "No" if it is not possible.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing the number of sticks and a list of their length exponents. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if a non-degenerate triangle can be formed with the sticks in the corresponding test case, or "No" if it cannot.**
