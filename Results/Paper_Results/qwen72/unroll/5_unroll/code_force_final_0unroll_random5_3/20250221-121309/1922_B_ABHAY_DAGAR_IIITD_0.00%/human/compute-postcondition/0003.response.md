To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the `results` list, as it is the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted. The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list, and for the loop to execute at least once, the `results` list must contain at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list that must have at least one element, `test_cases` list will remain unchanged, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
