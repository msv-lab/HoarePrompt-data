Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make the list `a` equal to the list `c` by either increasing or decreasing the elements of `a` to match the elements of `c`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the loop's internal variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. After all iterations, the loop has no effect on the initial state variables, and the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the program has printed the results for each test case.**
