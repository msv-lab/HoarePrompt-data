The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in the function signature. Based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. Here’s the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, which suggests it might represent the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, indicating that `n` and `m` are the sizes of two lists.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, which is a constraint on the total size of all `b_i` lists across multiple test cases.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes these inputs and returns some result based on the values of `a_i` and `b_i`. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are the sizes of lists `a_i` and `b_i` respectively, where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`. `a_i` is a list of `n` integers, and `b_i` is a list of `m` integers, both with values in the range `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a_i` and `b_i`.**
