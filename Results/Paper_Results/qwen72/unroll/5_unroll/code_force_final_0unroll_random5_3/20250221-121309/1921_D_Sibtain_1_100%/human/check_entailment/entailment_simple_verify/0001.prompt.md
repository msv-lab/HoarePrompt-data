You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make the list `a` equal to the list `c` by either increasing or decreasing the elements of `a` to match the elements of `c`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the loop's internal variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. After all iterations, the loop has no effect on the initial state variables, and the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the program has printed the results for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if all elements are the same, the maximum difference `D` is indeed `0`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

4. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference between this element and the largest and smallest elements in `c`. This is correct because for a single element, the maximum difference is indeed the maximum of the differences with the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes indices `i` and `j` to `0` and `1` respectively, and a variable `ans` to `0` to store the total difference.
   - It iterates through the elements of `a` and calculates the differences `t1` and `t2`:
     - `t1` is the difference between the current element in `a` and the current element in `c` (both starting from the beginning).
     - `t2` is the difference between the current element in `a` (starting from the end) and the current element in `c` (starting from the end).
   - It then updates the indices based on which difference is larger and adds the larger difference to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The sorting step ensures that the largest elements in `c` are paired with the smallest elements in `a` and vice versa, which maximizes the differences.
- The logic for handling the single element case is correct.
- The general case logic is also correct as it ensures that the maximum possible differences are added to `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
