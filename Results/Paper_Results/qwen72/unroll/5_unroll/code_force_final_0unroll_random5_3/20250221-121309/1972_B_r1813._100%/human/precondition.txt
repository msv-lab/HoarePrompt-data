The function `main` does not take any parameters. However, it is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D" characters, representing the initial state of the coins.
