Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. The function then prints 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in `s` is odd, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `index` is `1 + 2 * t`. The function does not return any value. **
