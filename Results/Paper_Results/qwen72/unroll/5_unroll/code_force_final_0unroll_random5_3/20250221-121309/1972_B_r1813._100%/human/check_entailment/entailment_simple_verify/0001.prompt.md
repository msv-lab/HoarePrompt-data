You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
if __name__ == '__main__':

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing the number of coins and their initial states, respectively.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `index` is `1 + 2 * t`. The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string `s` is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins:**
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, Alice will win, and the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob will win, and the program prints 'NO'.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key insight here is that the game is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If there is an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, and vice versa.
   - This is because each move removes one facing-up coin and flips two adjacent coins, which changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - Therefore, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he has an even number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Bob will be left with no facing-up coins to choose from, causing him to lose.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no facing-up coins (Bob loses) and where there is only one facing-up coin (Alice wins).
   - The program also handles the case where there are only two coins left, as the rules are correctly applied (one coin is removed, and the other is not flipped).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should work as expected for the given problem description.
