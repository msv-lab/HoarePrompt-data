Output State: **t is an integer provided by the user, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) cities with coordinates a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries. Each query is a pair of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.**
