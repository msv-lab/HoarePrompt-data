You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum is greater than or equal to 0.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples containing two integers each. It returns the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum is greater than or equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
