This function does not have input parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; 0 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by two lines of n integers each, representing the prices a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9) for Alice and Bob, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
