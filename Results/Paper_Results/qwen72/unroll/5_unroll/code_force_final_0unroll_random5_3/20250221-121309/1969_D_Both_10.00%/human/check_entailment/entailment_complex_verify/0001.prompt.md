You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read input. `func_1` reads a single integer, and `func_2` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input for the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_3` is responsible for calculating Alice's profit. It takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference `b_i - a_i` for each item. This difference represents the potential profit Alice can make from each item if Bob buys it.
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference `b_i - a_i` and the original `b_i` for each item. This is used to determine the optimal items Alice should buy and sell to Bob.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` initializes `sub_summ` to 0, which will store the total profit.
   - It first adds the sum of all `a_i` values (the cost Alice incurs for buying the items) to `sub_summ`.
   - Then, it iterates over `main_ar` and adds the profit from each item to `sub_summ` if the profit (`b_i - a_i`) is non-negative. This ensures that Alice only buys items that can potentially give her a profit.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice's strategy is to maximize her profit, so she should buy items where `b_i - a_i` is non-negative.
   - Bob's strategy is to minimize Alice's profit, so he will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values for free. This is because these items have the highest potential profit for Alice, and Bob wants to reduce that profit.

5. **Heap Usage:**
   - The program uses a heap to efficiently find the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values. This is a good approach because it allows for quick selection of the top `k` items.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning Bob takes no items for free. In this case, Alice can buy and sell all items with non-negative profit.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning Bob takes all items for free. In this case, Alice's profit will be 0 because Bob will take all items she buys.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read input, but they rely on a global function `putin()`, which is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical issue that would cause the program to fail if `putin()` is not defined elsewhere in the code.

- **Logic and Calculation:**
  - The logic in `func_3` is not entirely correct. It adds the sum of all `a_i` values to `sub_summ` and then adds the profit from items with non-negative `b_i - a_i` values. However, it does not account for Bob's strategy of taking the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
  - The correct approach should involve sorting the items by their profit (`b_i - a_i`) and then calculating the profit based on the top `k` items that Bob will take for free.

### Correctness:
- The program as provided is **incorrect** because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Additionally, the input parsing function `putin()` is not defined, which would cause the program to fail.

### Correctness: **False**
