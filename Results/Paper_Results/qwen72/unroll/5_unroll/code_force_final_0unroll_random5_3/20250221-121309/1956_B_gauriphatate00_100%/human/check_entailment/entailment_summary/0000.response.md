Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the card game problem by calculating the maximum number of points the player (you) can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The function `func_1` counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice, which is a key part of the strategy to determine your maximum possible score.

However, the program's logic is incomplete. The function `func_1` only counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition to determine the maximum score you can achieve. Here's why:

1. **Optimal Play by Nene**: The problem specifies that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means that if you play a card with a number that appears twice in your hand, Nene will play the matching card in her hand on her next turn to score a point. Therefore, the number of points you can score is limited by the number of such pairs you can play before Nene matches them.

2. **Scoring Mechanism**: To score a point, you need to play a card with a number that is already on the table. If you play a card with a number that appears twice in your hand, you can only score a point if you play the first card and Nene does not play the matching card before your next turn. If Nene plays the matching card, you will not score a point.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for you is to play cards with numbers that appear twice in your hand as early as possible, to maximize the chances of scoring points before Nene can match them. However, the program does not account for the order of play or the fact that Nene will always play optimally.

Given these points, the program's logic is incorrect because it does not consider Nene's optimal play. The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated strategy that takes into account the order of play and Nene's responses.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
