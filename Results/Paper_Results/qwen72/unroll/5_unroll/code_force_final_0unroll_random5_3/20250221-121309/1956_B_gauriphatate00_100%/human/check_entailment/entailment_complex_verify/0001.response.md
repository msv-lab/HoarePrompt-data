### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed between you and Nene, each receiving n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize your score, you should play cards that you have two copies of first, because if you play one of these cards and Nene has the other copy, she will play it on her turn and you will score a point.
   - Nene, being optimal, will always play a card that she has a second copy of if you have already played the first copy of that card, to score a point.
   - If you have only one copy of a card, Nene will not play the second copy until you have played all your cards that have a second copy, to avoid giving you a point.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine the maximum score you can achieve.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is used to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - The program then iterates through each integer from 1 to n and checks if you have two copies of that integer. If you do, it increments `max_score` by 1.
   - Finally, the program appends the result to a list `results` and prints each result after processing all test cases.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It correctly identifies the integers that you have two copies of and increments the score for each such integer.
   - The program does not explicitly simulate Nene's play, but it is not necessary to do so. The score you can achieve is determined by the number of integers you have two copies of, as Nene will always play the second copy if you have already played the first.

5. **Validation with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `count_a` is a dictionary that accurately counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - The loop that calculates `max_score` correctly identifies and counts the integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - The final state of `max_score` is indeed the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice, which aligns with the optimal strategy described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given the constraints and the optimal play of Nene. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
