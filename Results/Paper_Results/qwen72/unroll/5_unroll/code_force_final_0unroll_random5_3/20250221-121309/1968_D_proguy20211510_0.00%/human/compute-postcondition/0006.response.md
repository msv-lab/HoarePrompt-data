Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of two players `P_B` and `P_S`, a permutation `p`, and an array `a`. For each test case, it determines the outcome of a game where players move according to the permutation and accumulate points based on the array `a`. The function prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, indicating which player wins or if the game ends in a draw. The final state of the program includes the loop control variable `_` having the value of the number of test cases processed, and the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` being updated and used within each iteration, but their final values depend on the specific inputs of the last test case. **
