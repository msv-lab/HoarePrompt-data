Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the permutation game problem where two players, Bodya and Sasha, start from different positions on a permutation and an array, and over `k` turns, they either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation, accumulating scores based on the array `a`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - It identifies the maximum value in the array `a` and checks if both players start at positions with this maximum value. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only one player starts at a position with the maximum value, it prints the winner and continues to the next test case.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns, keeping track of the positions and scores of both players.
   - It uses two lists, `b` and `s`, to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha for each turn.
   - It also uses boolean flags `foundb` and `founds` to check if either player has reached a position with the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Optimization**:
   - If both players have found the maximum value in `a` within the first few turns, the program optimizes the remaining turns by adding the maximum value multiplied by the remaining turns to their scores.
   - This optimization is based on the assumption that once a player reaches a position with the maximum value, they will stay there to maximize their score.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - The program calculates the potential final scores for both players, considering the optimized scores if the maximum value was found.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where both players start at the same position with the maximum value.
   - It also handles the case where one player starts at a position with the maximum value and the other does not.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it avoids unnecessary computations once a player reaches the maximum value.
   - However, it could be more efficient by directly calculating the final scores without storing intermediate results in lists, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

8. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
