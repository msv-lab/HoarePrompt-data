t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing five elements: n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), P_B and P_S are positive integers (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions, p is a permutation of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and a is an array of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
