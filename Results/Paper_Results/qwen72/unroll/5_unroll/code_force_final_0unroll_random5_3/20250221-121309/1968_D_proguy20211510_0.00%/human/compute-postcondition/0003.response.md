The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables and constants mentioned in the state before the loop are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
