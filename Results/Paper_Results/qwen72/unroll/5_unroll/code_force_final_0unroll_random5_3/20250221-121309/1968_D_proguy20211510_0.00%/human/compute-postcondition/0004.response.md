Output State: **The loop will have processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` will have been updated and used within each iteration of the loop, but their final values will depend on the specific inputs for the last test case. The loop control variable `_` will have the value of the number of iterations completed, which is equal to the number of test cases `t`.**
