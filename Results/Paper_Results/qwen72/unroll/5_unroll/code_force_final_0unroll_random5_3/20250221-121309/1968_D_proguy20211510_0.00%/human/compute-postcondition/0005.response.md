The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each with specific parameters. The parameters it accepts are the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of two entities `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. The constraints for these parameters are as follows: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided parameters and constraints.**
