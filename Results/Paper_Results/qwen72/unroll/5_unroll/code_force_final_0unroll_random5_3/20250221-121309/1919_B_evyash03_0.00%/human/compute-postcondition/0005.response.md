The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" only, and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000 and `length` is equal to the length of `expression`.

The function returns the number of times the balance goes below zero (`count`) plus 1 if the final balance (`balance`) is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns `count` unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and a positive integer `length` that matches the length of `expression`. It returns the number of times the balance goes below zero plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns the number of times the balance goes below zero.**
