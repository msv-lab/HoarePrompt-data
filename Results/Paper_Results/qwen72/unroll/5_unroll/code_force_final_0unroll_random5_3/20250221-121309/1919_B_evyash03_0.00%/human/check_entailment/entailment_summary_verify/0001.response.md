Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. This part is accurate and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Splitting the String**: The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'`. This step is intended to handle segments of the string that are separated by `'-'`. However, this approach is not necessary for the problem and does not contribute to the correct solution. The correct approach should consider the entire string and its cumulative balance without splitting it.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The function iterates through the string `s` and maintains a `balance` variable to track the cumulative sum of the array `a` (where `a_i = 1` for `'+'` and `a_i = -1` for `'-'`). If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments a `count` variable and resets the `balance` to zero. Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

   - **Balance Calculation**: The `balance` variable correctly tracks the cumulative sum of the array `a` as it iterates through the string `s`.
   - **Counting Negative Segments**: The `count` variable is incremented whenever the `balance` becomes negative, which is a valid approach to count the number of segments that have a negative sum.
   - **Final Adjustment**: The expression `count + (balance > 0)` is used to add one to the count if the final `balance` is positive. This is because a positive `balance` at the end of the string indicates that there is an additional segment with a positive sum.

4. **Optimality**: The program's approach is not optimal. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty, which can be achieved by splitting the string in a way that minimizes the sum of the penalties of the segments. The current approach only counts the number of segments with a negative sum and adds one if the final sum is positive, but it does not consider the length of the segments or the absolute value of their sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty.

   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the minimization of the penalty by considering all possible splits and their lengths. It only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive, which is not the correct way to minimize the penalty.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the output should be `1` (since the penalty of `[1]` is `1`). The program correctly outputs `1`.
   - For the input `-----`, the output should be `5` (since the penalty of `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` is `5`). The program correctly outputs `5`.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the output should be `0` (since the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` with a penalty of `0`). The program correctly outputs `0`.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the output should be `4` (since the optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])` with a penalty of `4`). The program correctly outputs `4`.
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the output should be `4` (since the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1])` with a penalty of `4`). The program correctly outputs `4`.

Despite the program producing correct outputs for the given test cases, the reasoning and approach used in the function `func_1` are not optimal and do not correctly minimize the penalty by considering all possible splits and their lengths. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
