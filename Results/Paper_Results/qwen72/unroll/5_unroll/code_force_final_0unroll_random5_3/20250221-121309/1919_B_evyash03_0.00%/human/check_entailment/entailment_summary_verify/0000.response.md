### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The program's approach to splitting the string and calculating the penalty does not align with the problem's requirements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **String Splitting**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` by the '-' character, which results in a list of substrings that contain only '+' characters. This is incorrect because the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized, not just splitting by '-' characters.

3. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the balance by iterating through the characters in the `expression`. It increments the balance for '+' and decrements it for '-'. If the balance goes below zero, it resets the balance and increments a counter `count`.
   - The final penalty is the sum of the counter `count` and a boolean value `(balance > 0)` which adds 1 if the final balance is positive.

4. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty calculation logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - This approach does not take into account the possibility of splitting the array into subarrays with a sum of zero, which would result in a penalty of zero for those subarrays.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
- The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` or `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, both of which result in a total penalty of `0`.
- However, the provided program will output `3`:
  - The program splits the string into `['', '+', '+', '+', '+', '']`.
  - It then calculates the penalty based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters, which results in an incorrect penalty calculation.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through the string and keep track of the current sum of the array.
2. Whenever the current sum reaches zero, it should start a new subarray.
3. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
4. The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. The function `func_1` does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays optimally to minimize the penalty.

Final: **False**
