### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers for each outcome (`vals`).

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - This product is used to determine the bets for each outcome. Each bet is calculated as `prod // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.

3. **Denominator Calculation:**
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - The condition `if (den <= 0)` checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the amount received back for any winning outcome. If this condition is true, the program prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins exists.

4. **Output:**
   - If `den > 0`, the program prints the bets for each outcome, which are the elements of `vprod`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Bets:**
  - The bets are calculated as `prod // r` for each multiplier `r`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is `sum(vprod)`.
  - The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is `prod // r * r = prod`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where no valid distribution exists by checking if `den <= 0` and printing `-1`.
  - The program also handles the case where all multipliers are the same, which can lead to no valid distribution (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`).

- **Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that the bets are integers and within the range `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
