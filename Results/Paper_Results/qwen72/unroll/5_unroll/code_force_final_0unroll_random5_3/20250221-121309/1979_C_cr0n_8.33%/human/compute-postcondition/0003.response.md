The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one integer. The variable `r` will be set to the first integer in `vals` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `prod` is 1, `r` is the first integer in `vals`**
