#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the outcomes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the `vals` list, and all other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`) remain unchanged.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The print statement will output the integer `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the `vals` list, `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`, and all other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`) remain unchanged. Additionally, `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [prod/vals[0]] [prod/vals[1]] [prod/vals[2]] ... (where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in the input list. It also calculates a value `den` which is the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables.
