Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the outcomes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is an input integer. `vals` is a list of integers input by the user. `prod` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `prod` is initialized to 1.
- The initial state of `t`, `cases`, `N`, and `vals` remains unchanged.
- No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
