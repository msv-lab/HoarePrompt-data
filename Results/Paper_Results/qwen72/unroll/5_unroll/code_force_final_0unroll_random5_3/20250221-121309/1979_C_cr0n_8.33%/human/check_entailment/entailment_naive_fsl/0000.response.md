Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers is greater than or equal to 1, which is a critical edge case. In such a case, it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not check for this condition and may incorrectly output a solution.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
2 2
```
The multipliers are both 2. According to the problem, the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \). This means that the total amount bet on all outcomes cannot be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome, as the total amount bet would always be equal to the amount received back. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program will output `2 2`, which is incorrect.

This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
