You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the outcomes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the `vals` list, and all other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`) remain unchanged.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The print statement will output the integer `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the `vals` list, `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`, and all other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`) remain unchanged. Additionally, `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [prod/vals[0]] [prod/vals[1]] [prod/vals[2]] ... (where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
