### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will be used to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an empty list `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each element.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to count the number of trailing zeros in a given number (represented as a string).
   - For each element in the list, the program calls `func_1` and adds the result to the `zeros` list if it is greater than 0.
   - The `total_digits` is incremented by the length of each element.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then iterates over the `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values. This is intended to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can pair elements to maximize the number of digits removed.
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is used to store the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed by pairing elements.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The program incorrectly sets the answer to 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha'. This is a simple typo and should be fixed.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the typo is fixed.
- **False** if the typo is not fixed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Fix the typo here
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Additional Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number (as a string).
  - The state annotation is accurate: `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list.
  - It correctly identifies and stores the number of trailing zeros in the `zeros` list.
  - The sorting and pairing logic in the `zeros` list is intended to simulate Sasha's optimal play, but it needs to be verified if this logic correctly models the game's rules.
  - The winning condition check is based on the total number of digits minus the number of trailing zeros that can be removed by pairing. This logic is correct if the game's rules are accurately modeled.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified the typo in the output and provided a fix.
- The logic of the program, including the function `func_1` and the main game simulation, appears to be correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (due to the typo, the program is incorrect as it stands, but it would be correct if the typo is fixed).
