### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Leading Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `total_digits`.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string `num`.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until a non-zero digit is encountered.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the list `zeros` in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros to be subtracted from `total_digits` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - This step is intended to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits, and Anna can reverse numbers to minimize the number of digits.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, it assigns 'Sashah' to `answers[test]`.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'Anna' to `answers[test]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typo in Output:**
  - The program assigns 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha' to `answers[test]` when Sasha wins. This is a typo and should be corrected to 'Sasha'.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - The strategy of subtracting every second element in the sorted `zeros` list to simulate the optimal play is not entirely clear. The logic behind this step needs to be more rigorously justified to ensure it correctly models the game's optimal play.

- **Concatenation and Reversal:**
  - The program does not explicitly simulate the concatenation and reversal operations. Instead, it uses a heuristic based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros. This heuristic might not always correctly determine the winner, especially in edge cases where the optimal play involves more complex strategies.

### Conclusion:
The program has a typo in the output and the heuristic used to determine the winner might not be robust enough to handle all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
