Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Typo in Output**: The program outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" when Sasha wins. This is a clear typo and will cause the output to be incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Total Digits**: The program calculates `total_digits` by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers. However, this does not correctly account for the actual digit count after reversing the numbers. For example, reversing 100 results in 1, which has fewer digits than the original number.

3. **Handling of Reversed Numbers**: The program does not actually reverse the numbers as described in the problem. It only counts the trailing zeros and uses this to adjust the total digit count. This is insufficient because the reverse operation can significantly change the number of digits and the value of the number.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. The logic for determining the winner is based on a simplistic calculation that does not account for the complex interactions between the moves of Anna and Sasha.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Sashah
```

The typo in the output "Sashah" is the primary issue, but the logic for determining the winner is also flawed. The program should correctly handle the reversal of numbers and the optimal play strategy to ensure it works for all cases.
