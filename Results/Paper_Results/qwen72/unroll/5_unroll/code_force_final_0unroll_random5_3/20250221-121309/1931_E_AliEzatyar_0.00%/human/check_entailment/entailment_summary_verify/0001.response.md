### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will be used to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an empty list `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each element.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to count the number of trailing zeros in a given number (represented as a string).
   - For each element in the list, the program calls `func_1` and adds the result to the `zeros` list if it is greater than 0.
   - The `total_digits` is incremented by the length of each element.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then iterates over the `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values. This is intended to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can pair elements to maximize the number of digits removed.
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is used to store the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed by pairing elements.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The program incorrectly sets the answer to 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha'. This is a simple typo and should be fixed.

### Function Summary:
- **`func_1(num)`:**
  - Accepts a string `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string.
  - The list `num` remains unchanged after the function call.

### Evaluation:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string. This is essential for the program's logic to work as intended.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - The strategy of sorting the `zeros` list in descending order and summing every other element to simulate Sasha's optimal play is logical. Sasha would want to remove the most trailing zeros to minimize the number of digits left in the list.
  - However, the logic of checking `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is flawed. The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, which means the list is reduced to a single number. The condition should be based on whether the final number (after all possible moves) has at least `m` digits, not `m + 1`.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is incorrect. It should be `total_digits - subtract_zero >= m` to determine if Sasha wins.
  - The typo 'Sashah' should be fixed to 'Sasha'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m:  # Corrected condition
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Fixed typo
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Final Evaluation:
- **Original Assessment:**
  - The original assessment correctly identified the typo 'Sashah' and suggested fixing it.
  - However, it did not identify the incorrect winning condition logic.

- **Final Decision:**
  - The program is incorrect due to the flawed winning condition logic.
  - Fixing the typo alone is not sufficient to make the program correct.

Final: **False**
