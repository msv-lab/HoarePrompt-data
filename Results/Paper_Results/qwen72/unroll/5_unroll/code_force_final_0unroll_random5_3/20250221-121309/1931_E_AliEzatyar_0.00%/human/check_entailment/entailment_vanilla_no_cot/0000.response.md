Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Name Mismatch**:
   - The program assigns the result of the game to `answers[test]` using the string `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`. This is a typo and will cause the output to be incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Subtracting Zeros**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the logic for subtracting these zeros is flawed. The program subtracts the number of zeros in pairs, but this does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy for the game. The game involves reversing digits and then concatenating, which can change the number of digits significantly.

3. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list, but it does not consider the optimal play where Anna reverses the digits and Sasha concatenates them. The total number of digits alone is not sufficient to determine the winner.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal play strategy for both Anna and Sasha. The game's outcome depends on the specific moves made by the players, and the program's current logic does not account for this.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(array, m):
    # Anna's turn: reverse the digits of each number
    reversed_array = [reverse_number(int(item)) for item in array]
    
    # Count the total number of digits in the reversed array
    total_digits = sum(len(str(num)) for num in reversed_array)
    
    # Sasha's turn: concatenate the numbers
    while len(reversed_array) > 1:
        # Sasha will always choose the two largest numbers to concatenate
        reversed_array.sort(reverse=True)
        new_num = int(str(reversed_array[0]) + str(reversed_array[1]))
        reversed_array = [new_num] + reversed_array[2:]
    
    # Check if the final number is >= 10^m
    final_num = reversed_array[0]
    return final_num >= 10**m

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reverse Number Function**:
   - The `reverse_number` function correctly reverses the digits of a number and converts it back to an integer.

2. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The `can_sasha_win` function simulates the game by reversing the digits of each number in the array and then concatenating the two largest numbers in each turn. This ensures that Sasha is making the optimal move to maximize the number of digits.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After simulating the game, the function checks if the final number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\). If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

This corrected program should accurately determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for both players.
