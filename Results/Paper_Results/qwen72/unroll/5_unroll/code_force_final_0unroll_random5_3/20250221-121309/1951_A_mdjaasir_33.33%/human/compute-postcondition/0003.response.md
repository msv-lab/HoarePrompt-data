The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and the current directory contains subfolders with numeric names. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are numeric and fall within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current directory that are numeric and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`. If no such subfolders exist, it returns an empty list.**
