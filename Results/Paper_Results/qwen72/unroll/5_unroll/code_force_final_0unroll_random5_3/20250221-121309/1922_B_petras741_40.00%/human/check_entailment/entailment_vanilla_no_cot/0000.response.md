Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, there are several issues in the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `q`**:
   - The program initializes `q` as a dictionary but then immediately reassigns it to a list of zeros. This is unnecessary and confusing. It should just initialize `q` as a list of zeros directly.
   - The list `q` should be initialized with a size of `max(w) + 1` to avoid index out of range errors, but the program initializes it with a size of `n + 1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `eta`**:
   - The program appends indices to `eta` where `q[j] > 0`. This is correct, but the program should also ensure that `eta` is sorted, which is not explicitly done.

3. **Incorrect Triangle Counting Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of ways to form triangles, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2.
   - The condition `if j > 1000: break` is arbitrary and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It can lead to incorrect results if the number of unique lengths exceeds 1000.

4. **Incorrect Output for Test Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where all sticks have the same length. The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks is incorrect. It should be `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6` for the same length case, but the program uses `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        
        if n < 3:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Count the frequency of each length
        q = [0] * (max(w) + 1)
        for length in w:
            q[length] += 1
        
        # Calculate the number of ways to form a triangle
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(q)):
            if q[i] >= 3:
                res += q[i] * (q[i] - 1) * (q[i] - 2) // 6
            if q[i] >= 2:
                for j in range(i + 1, len(q)):
                    if q[j] > 0 and i + 1 > j:
                        res += q[i] * (q[i] - 1) // 2 * q[j]
        
        print(res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program initializes a list `q` to count the frequency of each stick length. The size of `q` is `max(w) + 1` to ensure all indices are within bounds.

3. **Triangle Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the frequencies to count the number of ways to form triangles:
     - If a length has at least 3 sticks, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
     - If a length has at least 2 sticks, it checks for other lengths that can form a triangle with the current length. The condition `i + 1 > j` ensures that the triangle inequality is satisfied.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
