The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `inf`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. The range `range(1, inf)` will start at 1 and go up to `inf - 1`. Since `inf` is defined as 200001, the range will start from 1 and go up to 200000, which means the loop will execute.

However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` should be initialized to 1, and `inf` must be greater than 1. Given that `inf` is already defined as 200001, it meets this condition.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a list of integers (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
