Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the value of `n` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Precomputation of Digit Sums**: The function precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `values`. This is an efficient approach because it avoids recalculating the digit sums for each test case, which is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The digit sum for each number `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of its digits. This is a correct method to compute the sum of digits of a number.

4. **Cumulative Sum Storage**: The cumulative sum of digit sums is stored in `values[i]` for each `i` from 1 to 200,000. This ensures that for any given `n`, the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` can be retrieved in constant time.

5. **Output for Each Test Case**: For each test case, the function reads the value of `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to `n`. This matches the expected output format.

6. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(200,000) time, which is efficient given the constraints. Each test case is then processed in O(1) time, which is well within the 0.5 seconds limit.

7. **Correctness of Precomputed Values**: The precomputed values in `values` are correct because the digit sum calculation and cumulative sum storage are done correctly.

8. **No State Mutations**: The state of the program remains unchanged after the function call, as required by the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
