You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of integers n representing the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `values` is a list where `values[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to 200000, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: The list `values` remains unchanged, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value` for each input `value` provided, where `value` is an integer read from the input for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining a large array `values` of size `inf`, where `inf` is set to `2 * 10^5 + 1`. This is to handle the maximum possible value of `n` as specified in the problem.
   - It then reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `inf` and stores these sums in the `values` array.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `inf`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`.
   - The value at `values[i]` is set to the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. This is done by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i - 1]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` from the input.
   - It then prints the precomputed sum of the digit sums for the number `n` by accessing `values[n]`.

### Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The precomputation step runs in \( O(\text{inf} \times \log(\text{inf})) \) time, where `inf` is \( 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \). This is because for each number `i` from 1 to `inf`, the program iterates over the digits of `i`, and the number of digits in `i` is \( \log(i) \).
  - The processing of each test case runs in \( O(1) \) time, as it simply involves accessing a precomputed value in the `values` array.
  - Given that the precomputation is done once and the test cases are processed in constant time, the overall time complexity is efficient and should meet the 0.5 seconds per test case requirement.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \( O(\text{inf}) \), which is \( O(2 \times 10^5 + 1) \). This is due to the `values` array that stores the cumulative sums of digit sums.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `inf` and stores the cumulative sums.
  - For each test case, it correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for the given `n` and prints it.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
