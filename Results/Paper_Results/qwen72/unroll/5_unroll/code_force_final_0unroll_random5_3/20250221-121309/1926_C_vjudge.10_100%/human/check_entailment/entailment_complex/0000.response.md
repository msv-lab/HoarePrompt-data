### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers, each representing a value for a test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Precomputation**: The function precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in the list `values`. This is an efficient approach because it allows the function to quickly answer each test case by simply looking up the precomputed value.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**: For each number `i` from 1 to 200000, the function calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`. This is a correct way to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

4. **Cumulative Sum**: The function correctly updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. This is done by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i-1]`.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the function prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the given value `value`. This is done by simply accessing `values[value]`, which is the correct precomputed value.

6. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000, and each test case is handled in O(1) time. This is efficient enough to meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, especially since the number of test cases `t` can be up to 10,000.

7. **State Management**: The function correctly maintains the state of the `values` list and the integer `t` throughout its execution. The `values` list is only modified during the precomputation step and remains unchanged during the test case processing.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
