### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the length of the permutation.
   - It then iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `a_i`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`.
   - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p_i`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The key insight is that the `MEX` of the first `i` elements of `p` is always a non-negative integer that is not in the set `{p_1, p_2, ..., p_i}`.
   - By starting from the end of the array and working backwards, the program ensures that the `MEX` value is correctly calculated and used to determine `p_i`.
   - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is the smallest value that has not yet been used in the permutation.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where all elements of `a` are the same (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), which results in a simple permutation like `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the problem requirements, and the permutation `p` is valid for the given `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
