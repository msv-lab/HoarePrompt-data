The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that each element `p[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` starts at `n` and is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]` for each `i` in reverse order. After processing all test cases, the function prints the permutation `p` for each test case. The final state of the program is that `t` remains the same, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, and `a` is the last list of integers input for the final test case. The list `p` will contain the calculated permutation for the final test case, and `mex` will be the minimum value in `p` for the final test case.
