Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is the same input integer, `n` is the last input integer for the final iteration, and `a` is the last list of integers input for the final iteration. The list `p` will contain the calculated values for the final iteration, and `mex` will be the minimum value in `p` for the final iteration.**
