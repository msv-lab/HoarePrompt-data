Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the problem's constraints and the definition of MEX. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`, which is a good starting point since we need to fill this list with the correct values.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is because initially, the MEX of an empty array is `0`, and as we fill in the permutation, the MEX will be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction**: The program iterates through the array `a` from the last element to the first. This is a crucial step because it allows us to determine the value of `p[i]` using the information from `a[i]` and the current MEX.

4. **Updating `p[i]`**: For each `i`, the program sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. This is derived from the equation \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Solving for \( p_i \), we get \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \). Since `mex` is the current MEX, `p[i]` is correctly set to `mex - a[i]`.

5. **Updating MEX**: After setting `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program handles all the constraints and ensures that the permutation `p` is valid and satisfies the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.
