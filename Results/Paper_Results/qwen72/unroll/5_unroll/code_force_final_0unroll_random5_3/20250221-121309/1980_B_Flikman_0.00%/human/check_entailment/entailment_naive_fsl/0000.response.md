Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes, and the number of cubes with the same or greater value is exactly equal to `k`. In such a case, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" in this scenario.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5 2 3
4 3 3 3 2

Expected Output:
MAYBE

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this example, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. There are 3 cubes with the same or greater value (4, 3, 3). After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, and the favorite cube could be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. If it is in the 2nd or 3rd position, it will be removed, but if it is in the 4th position, it will not be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program outputs "NO".
