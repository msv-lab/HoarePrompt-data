Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and see if it correctly handles all the cases:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` which are the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of cubes to be removed, respectively.
   - It then reads a list `a` of integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Identifying the Favorite Cube:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `favorite_value` by accessing `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Values:**
   - The function counts the number of cubes with values equal to `favorite_value` and stores this in `same_value_count`.
   - It also counts the number of cubes with values greater than `favorite_value` and stores this in `greater_count`.

4. **Determining the Outcome:**
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube. Therefore, the favorite cube will always be among the first `k` cubes to be removed, and the function prints 'YES'.
   - If the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means there are not enough cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube to ensure it is among the first `k` cubes to be removed. Therefore, the function prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes to be removed or not, depending on the specific arrangement after sorting. Therefore, the function prints 'MAYBE'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the favorite cube has a unique value (i.e., no other cube has the same value).
   - It also handles the case where multiple cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - The function reads input and prints output as required by the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
