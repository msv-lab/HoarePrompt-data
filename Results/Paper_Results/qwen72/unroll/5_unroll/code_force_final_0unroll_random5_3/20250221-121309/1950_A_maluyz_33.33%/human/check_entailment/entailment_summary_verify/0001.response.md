### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Stair Condition**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` using the condition `if a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Equal Digits Condition**:
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `elif a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition**:
   - The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This condition is not entirely correct. The peak condition should be `a < b > c`, but the current condition only checks if `b` is the maximum. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where `b` is the maximum but `a` and `c` are not in the correct order. For example, if `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 1`, the program will print "PEAK" even though it should print "NONE" because `a` is not less than `c`.

5. **None Condition**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they are classified as "NONE".

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: 1 2 3**
  - `a < b < c` is true, so the program correctly prints "STAIR".

- **Test Case: 3 2 1**
  - `a == b == c` is false.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` is false.
  - The program correctly prints "NONE".

- **Test Case: 1 5 3**
  - `a < b < c` is false.
  - `a == b == c` is false.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` is true, so the program correctly prints "PEAK".

- **Test Case: 3 4 1**
  - `a < b < c` is false.
  - `a == b == c` is false.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` is true, so the program correctly prints "PEAK".

- **Test Case: 0 0 0**
  - `a < b < c` is false.
  - `a == b == c` is true, so the program correctly prints "NONE".

- **Test Case: 4 1 7**
  - `a < b < c` is false.
  - `a == b == c` is false.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` is false.
  - The program correctly prints "NONE".

- **Test Case: 4 5 7**
  - `a < b < c` is true, so the program correctly prints "STAIR".

However, consider the test case `2 3 1`:
  - `a < b < c` is false.
  - `a == b == c` is false.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` is true, but the correct output should be "NONE" because `a` is not less than `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because the peak condition is not correctly implemented. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b` does not ensure that `a < b > c`, which is the correct definition of a peak.

Final: **False**
