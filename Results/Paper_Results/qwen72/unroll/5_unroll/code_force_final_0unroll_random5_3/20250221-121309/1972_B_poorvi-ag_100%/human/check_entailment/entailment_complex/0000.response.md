### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice will win the game if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The crucial observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will always have a move available, and she can force a win.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, the second player (Bob) will always have a move available, and he can force a win.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial state of the coins `arr`.
   - It then checks the count of 'U' in `arr` using `arr.count('U')`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list, indicating Alice will win.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it appends 'no' to the `results` list, indicating Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic for appending 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list is correct.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.
   - The program prints the results in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
