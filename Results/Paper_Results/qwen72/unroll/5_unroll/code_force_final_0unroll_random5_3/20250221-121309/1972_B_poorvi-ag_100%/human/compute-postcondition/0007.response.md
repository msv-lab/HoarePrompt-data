Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". The function then determines if the count of "U" in `s` is odd or even and appends "yes" or "no" to a list `results` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results`, indicating whether the count of "U" in each test case is odd ("yes") or even ("no"). The function does not return any value. **
