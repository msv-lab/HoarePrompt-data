The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the function determines the minimum number of moves required to make all coins face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the minimum number of moves required to make all coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction.**
