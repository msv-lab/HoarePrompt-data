You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Character Mapping**:
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each unique character in the string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of characters.
   - It uses `sorted(set(b))` to get the unique characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order.
   - It then maps each character `c` to its symmetric character using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. However, this mapping is incorrect because it should map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted set, not based on the length of the entire string `b`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `b` and builds the decoded string `s` by looking up the character in `char_map`.
   - The logic for building the decoded string is correct, but it relies on the incorrect `char_map` created in the previous step.

4. **Correct Mapping**:
   - The correct mapping should be based on the length of the unique set of characters, not the length of the string `b`.
   - The correct mapping should be `char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-i-1]`, where `sorted_unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters in `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the decoded string for each test case.

Given the incorrect character mapping, the program will not produce the correct decoded string for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
