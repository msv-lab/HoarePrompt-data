The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`. `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` has been replaced by the corresponding lowercase Latin letter from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by the corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary, maintaining the same length as `b`.**
