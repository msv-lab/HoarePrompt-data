Output State: **The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input, constructs a grid `a` of size `n` by `m` from input, and checks if the first row and last row of the grid are either entirely 'W' or 'B' and different from each other, or if the first and last columns of the grid are entirely 'W' or 'B' and different from each other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the grid `a` are no longer in scope, and the initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
