### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row are entirely composed of the same character ('W' or 'B') and are different from each other. If so, it prints "NO".
   - It also checks if the first column and the last column are entirely composed of the same character and are different from each other. If so, it prints "NO".

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program prints "YES" if neither of the above conditions is met. This is based on the idea that if the first and last rows or columns are not entirely the same color or are not different from each other, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color through the operations described.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **First Row and Last Row:**
  - If the first row and the last row are entirely the same color but different from each other, it means that there is no way to perform an operation that would change the color of the entire grid to a single color. This is because any operation that involves the first row and the last row would have to change the color of one of them, which is not possible if they are already entirely different colors.
- **First Column and Last Column:**
  - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are entirely the same color but different from each other, it means that there is no way to perform an operation that would change the color of the entire grid to a single color. This is because any operation that involves the first column and the last column would have to change the color of one of them, which is not possible if they are already entirely different colors.

### Potential Issues:
- **General Case:**
  - The program assumes that if the first and last rows or columns are not entirely the same color or are not different from each other, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This assumption is correct because if there is at least one row or column that has both colors, we can always perform operations to make the entire grid the same color.
- **Special Cases:**
  - The program handles the special case where the grid is already the same color by default, which is correct.
  - The program also handles the case where the grid has only one row or one column, which is correct.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Single Row or Column:**
  - If the grid has only one row or one column, the program will always print "YES" because a single row or column is already the same color.
- **Mixed Rows and Columns:**
  - If the grid has mixed colors in the first and last rows or columns, the program will print "YES" because it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and prints "NO" in those cases. It also correctly prints "YES" in all other cases where it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. The logic and conditions used in the program are sound and cover all necessary cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
