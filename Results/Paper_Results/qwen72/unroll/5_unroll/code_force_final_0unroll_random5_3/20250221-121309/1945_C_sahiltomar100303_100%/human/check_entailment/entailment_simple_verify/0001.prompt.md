You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the position of the optimal division point between the left and right sides of the houses. The optimal division point is the one that minimizes the absolute difference between the number of residents on each side who want to live on the left or right side. After all iterations, the variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not retained between test cases. The loop will have completed all `t` iterations, and the output will be the printed results for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the village.
   - It initializes counters for the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the midpoint.

3. **Counting Initial Preferences:**
   - The function counts the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the midpoint.

4. **Left Side Adjustment:**
   - The function moves the road position from the midpoint to the left, decrementing the left side counters and incrementing the right side counters as it moves.
   - It checks if the current position satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

5. **Right Side Adjustment:**
   - The function moves the road position from the midpoint to the right, incrementing the left side counters and decrementing the right side counters as it moves.
   - It checks if the current position satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - The function determines the optimal position by comparing the distances from the midpoint to the left and right positions.
   - It handles edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Setup and Counting:**
  - The function correctly initializes the midpoint and counts the initial preferences on both sides.
  - This ensures that the initial conditions are set up correctly for further adjustments.

- **Left Side Adjustment:**
  - The function correctly adjusts the counters as it moves the road position to the left.
  - It checks the condition for satisfaction on both sides and continues moving left until the condition is met or the road is placed before the first house.

- **Right Side Adjustment:**
  - The function correctly adjusts the counters as it moves the road position to the right.
  - It checks the condition for satisfaction on both sides and continues moving right until the condition is met or the road is placed after the last house.

- **Final Decision:**
  - The function correctly compares the distances from the midpoint to the left and right positions and selects the optimal position.
  - It handles edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house by checking the satisfaction conditions for these positions.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Side Satisfaction:**
  - If the road can only be placed on one side (either before the first house or after the last house), the function correctly handles this by checking the satisfaction conditions for these positions.

- **Multiple Valid Positions:**
  - If there are multiple valid positions, the function correctly selects the one that is closest to the midpoint.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle the problem by ensuring that the road is placed in a position where at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, and it minimizes the distance from the midpoint. The logic and conditions are implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
