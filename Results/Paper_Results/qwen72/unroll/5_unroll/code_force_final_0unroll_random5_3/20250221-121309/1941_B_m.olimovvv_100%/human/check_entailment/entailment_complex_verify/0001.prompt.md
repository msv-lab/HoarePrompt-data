You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will iterate `t` times. For each iteration, if the list `b` can be modified such that the last two elements are 0 by the given operations and all elements in `b` are non-negative during the process, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged, and the list `a` will be re-assigned to a new list of `n` integers in each iteration, but its final state after the loop is undefined as it is overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads input from the user multiple times, where the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (3 <= a <= 2 * 10^5) and a list `b` of `a` integers (0 <= b_j <= 10^9). The function then attempts to modify the list `b` such that the last two elements become 0 by performing a series of operations on the elements of `b`. If it can achieve this without any element in `b` becoming negative during the process, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is re-assigned in each iteration but its final state is undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero using the given operation.
   - The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `a` and the array itself `b`.
   - It then iterates through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element (excluding the last two elements).
   - During each iteration, it checks if the current element `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` (subtract `2 * b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`).
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` (subtract `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`).
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (set `b[i]` to zero).
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - **Negative Elements Check**: The program correctly checks if any element becomes negative during the operations, which is a valid condition to print "NO".
   - **Operation Logic**: The operation logic is correct for reducing the elements to zero. However, the program does not handle the case where the operation might make `b[i + 1]` or `b[i + 2]` negative.
   - **Final Check**: The final check for the last two elements being zero is correct, but it does not account for the possibility that the operation might leave other elements non-zero.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the operation might make `b[i + 1]` or `b[i + 2]` negative, which would invalidate the possibility of making all elements zero.
   - The program does not check if the operation leaves any element in the middle of the array non-zero, which could also invalidate the possibility.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program is **not** correct because it does not fully account for the possibility of making elements negative during the operation, which would prevent the array from being reduced to all zeros.
   - Additionally, the program does not check if the operation leaves any middle elements non-zero, which is another critical condition.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
