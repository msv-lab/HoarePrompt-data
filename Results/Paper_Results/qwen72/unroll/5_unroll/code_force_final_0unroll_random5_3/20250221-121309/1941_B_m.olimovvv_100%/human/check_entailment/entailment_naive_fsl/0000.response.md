Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the array has elements that are not initially zero but become zero through the operations. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
0 2 2 2 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case because it does not account for the possibility that the elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` can be adjusted to zero through the operations, even if they are not initially zero. The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` can be reduced to zero by the operations applied to the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
