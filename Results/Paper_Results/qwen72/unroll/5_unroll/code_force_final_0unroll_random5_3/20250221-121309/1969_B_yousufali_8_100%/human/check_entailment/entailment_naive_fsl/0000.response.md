Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the scenario where the string is already sorted, which should result in a cost of 0. Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string in all cases. For example, consider the input string "1010". The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 3 (by shifting the substring "101" to get "0110" and then shifting "110" to get "0011"), but the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

To illustrate:
- For the input "1010", the program will output 4, but the correct output should be 3.
- For the input "0000", the program will output 0, which is correct.
- For the input "11000", the program will output 9, which is correct.

However, the incorrect handling of the "1010" case and similar cases makes the program incorrect.
