Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is in `func_1`, where the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string is incorrect.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost by adding `n + 1` every time it encounters a '0' after a '1'. This logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
   - The correct approach should consider the number of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string to make it sorted. The cost of each operation should be the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Handling of Sorted Strings:**
   - The function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. For example, for the input "0000", the function should output 0, but the current logic does not ensure this.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Identify the number of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string.
- Calculate the cost of each cyclic shift operation based on the length of the substring being shifted.
- Ensure that the function correctly handles already sorted strings.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    if ones == 0 or ones == n:
        return 0  # The string is already sorted
    cost = float('inf')
    ones_count = 0
    for i in range(2 * n):
        if s[i % n] == '1':
            ones_count += 1
        if i >= ones:
            if s[(i - ones) % n] == '1':
                ones_count -= 1
        cost = min(cost, ones + (ones_count > 0))
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        print(func_1(s))

# Example usage
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **func_1(s):**
  - `ones` is the total number of '1's in the string.
  - If the string is already sorted (all '0's or all '1's), the cost is 0.
  - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The window size is the number of '1's in the string.
  - `ones_count` keeps track of the number of '1's in the current window.
  - The cost is updated to the minimum value found during the sliding window process.
- **func_2():**
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, reads the binary string `s` and calls `func_1(s)` to print the minimum cost.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
