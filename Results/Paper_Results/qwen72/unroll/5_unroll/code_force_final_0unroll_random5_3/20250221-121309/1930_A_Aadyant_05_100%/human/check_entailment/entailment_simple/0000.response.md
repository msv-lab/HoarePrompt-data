Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Summing**: The function sorts the list of integers and then sums the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This approach is correct because the problem requires selecting pairs and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. By sorting the list, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and taking every second element starting from the first ensures that we are always adding the smaller of each pair.

3. **Output**: The function appends the sum to a list `final` and then prints each element of `final` after processing all test cases. This matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements are the same, the sum of the elements at even indices will be the maximum possible score.

5. **Efficiency**: The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(2n \log 2n)\), which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The subsequent summation step is \(O(n)\), which is also efficient.

6. **State Consistency**: The state of the program before and after the function call is consistent with the problem description. The `final` list contains the correct number of integers, and the inputs are processed as expected.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
