The only objects in the loop head are variables `num` and the result of `int(n)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(n)`. If `int(n)` is at least 1, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, `final` is an empty list, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and `n` is a string. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a string that can be converted to an integer, and this integer must be greater than 0. 

Since `num` is the loop variable, it starts at 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a string that represents an integer greater than 0.

State: **`final` is an empty list, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0**
