### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then the list of integers `list1`.

2. **List Conversion and Sorting:**
   - The function converts the input string `b` into a list of integers `list2`.
   - It then sorts the list `list2`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the score by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list `list2`. This is based on the observation that, in a sorted list, the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements will always be the element at the even index (0-based indexing).

4. **Output:**
   - The function appends the calculated score to the `final` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each score in the `final` list.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements in the list are the same.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by always selecting the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements in a sorted list.
- The input and output handling is consistent with the problem description.
- The function processes multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The function is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
