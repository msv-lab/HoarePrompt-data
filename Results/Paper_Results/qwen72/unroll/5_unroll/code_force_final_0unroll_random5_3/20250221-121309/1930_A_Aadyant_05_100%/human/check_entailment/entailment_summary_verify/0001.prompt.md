You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices. The function then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints a list of `t` integers, each being the sum of the elements at even indices of a sorted list of integers input by the user. The final state of the program is that `t` remains an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` remains a string, and the `final` list contains `t` integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `a` (which is `n`), and then reads the list of `2n` integers from the input.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score `s`. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the first element of each pair is the smaller of the two, and thus the minimum value.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the final scores for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of pairs `a` but does not use it. This is not necessary for the solution, but it does not affect the correctness.
  - The program should read the number of pairs `a` and then the list of integers in a single line for each test case, but it reads them in two separate lines. This is a minor issue but could lead to confusion.

- **Data Types:**
  - The program converts the input to integers correctly, which is necessary for the sorting and summing operations.

- **Logic:**
  - The logic of sorting the list and summing the first element of each pair is correct and follows the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of logic and output. However, the input handling could be improved for clarity and to match the problem description more closely. Despite this, the program will produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
