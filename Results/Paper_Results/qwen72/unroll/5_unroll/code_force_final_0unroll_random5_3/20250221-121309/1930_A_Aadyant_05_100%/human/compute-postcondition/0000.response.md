The value of `n` is assigned the result of `input()`, which accepts user input. Since `input()` returns a string, `n` will be a string. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers on the whiteboard for each test case. `n` is a string.**
