The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The number of test cases `t` should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 1000. The initial state specifies that the function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
