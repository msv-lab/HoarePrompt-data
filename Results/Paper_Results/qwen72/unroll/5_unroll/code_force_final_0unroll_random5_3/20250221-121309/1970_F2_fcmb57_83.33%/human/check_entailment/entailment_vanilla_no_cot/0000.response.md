Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to move players, but it incorrectly handles the movement. The function should return a new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`, but the input to the function is a tuple `(x, y)` and a tuple `(dx, dy)`. The function should be modified to handle the movement correctly.

2. **Handling of the Quidditch ball**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the catching and throwing of the Quidditch ball.
   - When a player catches the ball, the program should update the `quidditch` list to indicate that the player is now carrying the ball. The current implementation uses `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`, which does nothing.
   - When a player throws the ball, the program should update the `quidditch` list to indicate that the ball is no longer being carried by the player and should reset to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

3. **Scoring and Goal Handling**:
   - The program incorrectly handles scoring. It should check if the player is in the correct goal and update the score accordingly.
   - The program should also handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

4. **Elimination of Players**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the elimination of players when they are in the same cell as a Bludger. It should check if the player is carrying the Quidditch ball and handle the ball's position correctly after the player is eliminated.

5. **Final Score Output**:
   - The final score output is correct, but the program should ensure that all other events are printed correctly before this line.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
movements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']  # [position, carrier]
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Initialize the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        # Move the player
        current_pos = players[mo[0]]
        new_pos = (current_pos[0] + movements[mo[1]][0], current_pos[1] + movements[mo[1]][1])
        players[mo[0]] = new_pos
        
        # Check for Bludger collision
        if '.B' in players and players[mo[0]] == players['.B']:
            print(i, mo[0], 'ELIMINATED')
            if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
                quidditch[1] = ''
            del players[mo[0]]
    
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        # Catch the Quidditch ball
        if players[mo[0]] == quidditch[0]:
            quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        # Throw the Quidditch ball
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

### Key Changes:
- **Movement Function**: Correctly updates the player's position.
- **Bludger Collision**: Correctly eliminates the player and handles the Quidditch ball.
- **Catching the Ball**: Correctly updates the `quidditch` list to indicate the player is carrying the ball.
- **Throwing the Ball**: Correctly updates the `quidditch` list and checks for scoring, updating the score and resetting the ball's position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

This corrected program should now correctly simulate the game and produce the expected output based on the problem description.
