Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players.
   - It initializes a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map the movement directions to their respective changes in coordinates.
   - It correctly calculates the middle of the field and initializes the `quidditch` list to store the position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it.
   - The initial field is parsed correctly, and the positions of the Quaffle, goals, and players are stored appropriately.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `T` and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the position of the player using the `func_1` function.
   - It checks if the player moves to the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event if so.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of the player and updates the Quaffle's position if necessary.
   - For catch actions (`C`), it incorrectly uses `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` instead of `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to update the player carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throw actions (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team and updates the score accordingly.
   - It prints the goal event and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

3. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score after processing all the moves.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the position of the player based on the movement direction.
   - However, it does not check if the new position is within the bounds of the field, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors if not handled properly.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The catch action (`C`) is incorrectly implemented. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to update the player carrying the Quaffle.
   - The throw action (`T`) has a logical error in the goal scoring check. It should check if the player is at a goal of the opposite team and then update the score and reset the Quaffle's position accordingly. The current implementation only updates the score if the player is at the goal, but it does not handle the case where the player throws the Quaffle and it remains at the goal.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, which is guaranteed not to happen in the problem description.
   - The program does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time, which is required to print the events in alphabetical order.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
