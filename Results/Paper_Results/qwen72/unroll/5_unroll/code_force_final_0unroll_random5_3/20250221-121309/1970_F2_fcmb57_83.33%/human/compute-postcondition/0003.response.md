The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function returns the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are the initial positions, and `dx` and `dy` are the changes in position. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, the exact returned values cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function accepts two odd integer parameters `a` and `b` within the range 3 to 99, representing the dimensions of a field. It returns the new positions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, but the exact values depend on the initial positions `x` and `y`, and the changes in position `dx` and `dy`, which are not specified.**
