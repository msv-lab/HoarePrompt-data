The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of the current directory, subfolders, and `.html` files does not affect the loop's execution directly, so these do not need to be adjusted. 

State: **`start` and `end` are integers with `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits, some of which contain `.html` files, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
