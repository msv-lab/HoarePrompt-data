You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the output will be either a * b or round(a * d), depending on the condition a * b < a * d. The variable c is read from input and used to calculate d, but its value is not stored or used outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 30` and `c` is any integer. It calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and `c` is not stored or used outside the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. However, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are read in the wrong order. According to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the program reads `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is incorrect and will lead to using the wrong values for calculations.

2. **Variable Naming**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the program, but they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` to match the problem description. This mismatch will cause the program to use incorrect values for the calculations.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to be the price of one yogurt if bought in a promotion. However, `c` should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It should be checking if the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price as much as possible.
     - If the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually, use the promotion price.
     - If there is an odd number of yogurts, buy one yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Output**: The program should print the minimum cost for each test case, but due to the incorrect variable usage, it will not produce the correct output.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
