You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each integer in the range 0 to 99) and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

The program fails in the first test case. Here's why:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
   - The program should check if it is possible to make the array sorted by performing the operation on any element that is at least 10.
   - The program attempts to split the first element `12` into `[1, 2]` and insert them back into the array, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
   - The array is now sorted, so the expected output is `YES`.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements need to be split in a specific order to achieve the sorted array. It only splits the first element it finds that is greater than 10, which may not always lead to the correct result.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - The initial array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
   - The program should determine that it is not possible to sort the array using the given operations.
   - The program correctly outputs `NO`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - The initial array is `[0, 0]`.
   - The array is already sorted, so the expected output is `YES`.
   - The program correctly outputs `Yes`.

### Specific Issue:
The main issue is in the logic of the loop where the program attempts to split elements. It only splits the first element it finds that is greater than 10, and it does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements in a specific order to achieve the sorted array. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve the sorted order.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through the array and split all elements that are at least 10.
2. After splitting, check if the resulting array is sorted.
3. If the array is sorted, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    new_arr = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            for digit in str(num):
                new_arr.append(int(digit))
        else:
            new_arr.append(num)
    return new_arr == sorted(new_arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_array(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly handles all potential cases by splitting all elements that are at least 10 and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.
