### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array, checking if the array is not already sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is not sorted and an element greater than 10 is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through the array and performs the split operation if an element greater than 10 is found and the array is not already sorted.
   - However, the logic has a critical flaw: it only performs the split operation once for each element, and it does not recheck the array after each split to see if it has become sorted.
   - This means that if the array requires multiple splits to become sorted, the program will not correctly identify this and may prematurely conclude that the array cannot be sorted.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - After splitting 12, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
     - The array is now sorted, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.
   - **Example 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
     - After splitting 12, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
     - The array is still not sorted, and the program will not split 28, so it incorrectly prints 'No'.
   - **Example 3**: `[0, 0]`
     - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it only performs the split operation once for each element and does not recheck the array after each split. This can lead to premature conclusions and incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
