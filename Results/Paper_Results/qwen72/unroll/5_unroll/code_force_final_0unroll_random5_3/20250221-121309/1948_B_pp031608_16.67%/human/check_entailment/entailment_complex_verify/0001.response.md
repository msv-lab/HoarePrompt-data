### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - This function is used to determine if the array is sorted after performing any operations.
   - The function is correct and does not modify the input list `lst`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it iterates over the array `list1` from the second element to the last.
   - It checks if the current element `list1[p - 1]` is greater than the next element `list1[p]` and if `list1[p - 1]` is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - It extracts the digits of `list1[p - 1]` and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
     - This is done using `a // 10` to get the first digit and `a % 10` to get the second digit.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Operation Application**:
  - The program only applies the operation once per element and does not continue to apply the operation recursively until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it does not consider further operations on `45` or `67` if needed.
  - This is a significant issue because the problem requires the operation to be applied any number of times, and the program does not handle this requirement correctly.

- **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
  - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not split `28` to potentially sort the array.
  - This condition only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and is greater than 10, but it does not ensure that the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not fully implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation. The program only applies the operation once per element and does not consider further operations that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.

### Final: **False**
