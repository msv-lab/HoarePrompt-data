You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each integer in the range 0 to 99) and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - This function is used to determine if the array is sorted after performing any operations.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it iterates over the array `list1` from the second element to the last.
   - It checks if the current element `list1[p - 1]` is greater than the next element `list1[p]` and if `list1[p - 1]` is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - It extracts the digits of `list1[p - 1]` and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
     - This is done using `a // 10` to get the first digit and `a % 10` to get the second digit.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Operation Application**:
  - The program only applies the operation once per element and does not continue to apply the operation recursively until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it does not consider further operations on `45` or `67` if needed.

- **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
  - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not split `28` to potentially sort the array.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not fully implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation. The program only applies the operation once per element and does not consider further operations that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.

### Correctness: **False**
