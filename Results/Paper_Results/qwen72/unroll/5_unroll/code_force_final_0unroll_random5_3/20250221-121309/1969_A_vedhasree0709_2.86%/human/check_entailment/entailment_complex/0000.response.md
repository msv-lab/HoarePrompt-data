Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program checks for a very specific condition: if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+2) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i+1). However, this condition is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
In this case, the best friends are arranged in a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. To invite at least 2 friends, Monocarp can invite any 2 friends, and they will both come because they are part of a cycle. The correct answer should be 2, but the program will print 3 because it does not find the specific pair (i, i+1) such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.

Another example:
```
4
3 4 1 2
```
Here, the best friends are also arranged in a cycle: 1 -> 3 -> 1 and 2 -> 4 -> 2. Again, the correct answer should be 2, but the program will print 3 for the same reason.

The program fails to handle these and other general cases where the best friends are not in the specific pattern it checks for. A correct solution would need to consider all possible pairs and cycles to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

Correctness: **False**
