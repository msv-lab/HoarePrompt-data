Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there is a specific pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+2) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i+1). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, suggesting that 3 invitations are needed.

However, this approach is flawed because it only checks for a very specific pattern and does not consider the general case where friends can form cycles or chains of best friendships. For example, in the second test case provided in the problem, the best friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. In this case, the program will incorrectly print 3, even though the correct answer is 2 (inviting any two friends from the cycle will ensure at least 2 friends attend the party).

A correct approach would involve identifying cycles and chains in the best friend relationships and determining the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. The program should be able to handle any valid input configuration, not just the specific pattern it checks.

Correctness: **False**
