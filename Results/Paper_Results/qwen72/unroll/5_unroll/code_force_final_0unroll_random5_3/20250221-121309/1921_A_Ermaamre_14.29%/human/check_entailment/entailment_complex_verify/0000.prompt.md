You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

    #State: The loop will print the area of each square for each test case, calculated as the square of the side length. The side length is determined by the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the given points, assuming the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `i` will be updated within the loop, but their final values after the loop ends are not relevant to the output state. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input (stdin) an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each containing the coordinates of four corners of a square. It calculates and prints the area of each square to standard output (stdout). The area is computed as the square of the side length, which is determined by the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the given points, assuming the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes a specific order of the input coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The problem states that the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, but the program only checks a limited set of conditions for the coordinates, which may not cover all possible permutations of the corners.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square in this case because it does not handle the scenario where the coordinates are given in this particular order. The program should be able to handle any permutation of the corner coordinates and still correctly compute the area of the square.
