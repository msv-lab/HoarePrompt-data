### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment correctly points out that sorting the array in ascending order does not maximize the beauty. However, the optimal way to maximize the beauty is not necessarily to sort the array in descending order. Instead, the optimal way is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the differences as \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value. This is because the differences will be positive and will sum up to the maximum possible value.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(array)` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and then printed one by one.
   - The function summary confirms that `func_2` processes the input correctly and calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Optimal Solution:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements without taking the absolute value. This is because the differences will be positive and will sum up to the maximum possible value.
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` is incorrect because it uses `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`, which is not necessary and can lead to suboptimal results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` does not maximize the beauty correctly.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
