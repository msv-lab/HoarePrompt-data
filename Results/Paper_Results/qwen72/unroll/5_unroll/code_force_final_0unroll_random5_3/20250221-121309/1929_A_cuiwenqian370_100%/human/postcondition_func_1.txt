The function `func_2` reads a formatted input from stdin, processes it to extract multiple arrays of integers, applies `func_1` to each array, and prints the results. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to stdout. The internal state of the function, including variables like `index` and `results`, is not relevant to the user.
