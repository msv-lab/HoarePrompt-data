You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a formatted input from stdin, processes it to extract multiple arrays of integers, applies `func_1` to each array, and prints the results. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to stdout. The internal state of the function, including variables like `index` and `results`, is not relevant to the user.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has duplicate elements correctly. The problem description states that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The function `func_1` calculates the beauty using the absolute difference, which is not what the problem description specifies. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences without taking the absolute value.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be 1, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of \((3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1\). However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.
