Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. The problem description specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the function `func_1` calculates the beauty using the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach does not align with the problem's requirements, as it will always yield a non-negative sum, which is not necessarily the maximum beauty as defined.

To illustrate this, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be 1, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of \((3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1\). However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The issue is that sorting the array and then summing the absolute differences does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined. The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements without taking the absolute value. This would ensure that the differences are maximized in the correct direction.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += (array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**. The original program is incorrect because it uses the absolute differences instead of the specified differences. The corrected version would be correct.
