The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `data`, `index`, and `results` are not in the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
