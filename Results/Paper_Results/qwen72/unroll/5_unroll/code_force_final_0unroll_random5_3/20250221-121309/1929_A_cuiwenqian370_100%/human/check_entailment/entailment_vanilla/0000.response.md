### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, sorting the array in ascending order is not the optimal way to maximize the beauty. The optimal way is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the differences, as this will maximize the positive differences.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(array)` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and then printed one by one.

4. **Optimal Solution:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the largest elements will be placed at the beginning, and the smallest elements will be placed at the end, maximizing the positive differences.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order, which does not maximize the beauty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
