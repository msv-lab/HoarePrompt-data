Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the results. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Handling of 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM**: The program incorrectly sets `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'AM' for the hour '12'. According to the 12-hour clock, '12:00' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 PM', not '12:00 AM'. Similarly, '00:00' should be '12:00 AM', not '12:00 PM'.

2. **Redundant Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each hour from '01' to '23'. This is unnecessarily verbose and can be simplified using arithmetic operations.

3. **Edge Case for '12'**: The program does not correctly handle the transition from '12' to '00' in the 24-hour format. For example, '12:00' should be '12:00 PM', but the program incorrectly sets it to '12:00 AM'.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
