You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 100`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (where `1 <= n, m <= 100`) from the input. The function then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Initial Condition:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
   - **Addition and Removal:** Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - **Final Condition:** After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - If `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, then the number of cubes added must be equal to the number of cubes removed plus `m`.
   - Let `a` be the number of cubes added and `r` be the number of cubes removed.
   - We have the equation: \( a - r = m \).
   - The total number of moves is \( a + r = n \).

4. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From the equations \( a - r = m \) and \( a + r = n \), we can solve for `a` and `r`:
     - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \)
     - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \)
   - Both `a` and `r` must be non-negative integers. Therefore, \( n - m \) must be even (since `r` must be an integer), and \( n \ge m \) (since `a` must be non-negative).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Verification:**
   - The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are necessary and sufficient to ensure that it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The program correctly implements these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
