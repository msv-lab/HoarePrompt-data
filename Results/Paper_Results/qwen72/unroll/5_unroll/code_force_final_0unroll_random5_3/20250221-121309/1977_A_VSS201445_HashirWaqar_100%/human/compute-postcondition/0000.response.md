The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop index, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
