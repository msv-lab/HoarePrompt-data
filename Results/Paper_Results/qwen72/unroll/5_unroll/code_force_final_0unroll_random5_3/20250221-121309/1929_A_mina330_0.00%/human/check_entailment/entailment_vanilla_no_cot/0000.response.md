Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, which is done by pairing the smallest and largest available elements after sorting. This approach ensures that the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: For each test case, it sorts the array `a`. Sorting is essential because it allows us to pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program then iterates over the first half of the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. Specifically, it adds the difference between the i-th largest element and the i-th smallest element for each i from 0 to len(a) // 2 - 1.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved, as the differences between the largest and smallest elements are maximized. The program handles all the constraints and test cases correctly.
