The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `a`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each inner list in `a` contains `n` integers, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the inner list satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case from the input list of lists `a`. For each test case, the function determines some property or performs some operation on the list of integers and returns the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `a`, where each inner list contains integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on some operation or property of the integers in the inner lists.**
