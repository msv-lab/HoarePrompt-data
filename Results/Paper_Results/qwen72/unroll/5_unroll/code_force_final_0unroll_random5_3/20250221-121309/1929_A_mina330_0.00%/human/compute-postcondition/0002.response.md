Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ntest` remains the same input integer between 1 and 500, `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases, and the list of lists remains unchanged. For each test case, the variable `kq` will have been calculated and printed as the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`, taken in pairs from the ends towards the center. The final value of `kq` for each test case will be the output for that test case.**
