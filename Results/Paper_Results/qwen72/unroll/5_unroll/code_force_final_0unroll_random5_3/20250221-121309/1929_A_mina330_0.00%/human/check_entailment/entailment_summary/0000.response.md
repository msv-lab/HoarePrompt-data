Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the largest and smallest elements, which ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The variable `kq` is initialized to 0.
   - The program iterates over the first half of the sorted array, pairing the largest and smallest elements.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and adds it to `kq`.

4. **Output:**
   - The calculated beauty `kq` is printed for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired, which maximizes the differences.
- The sum of these differences is the maximum possible beauty of the array.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
  - Sorted: `1 2 3`
  - Differences: \((3 - 1) = 2\)
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
  - Sorted: `69 69 69`
  - Differences: \((69 - 69) = 0\)
  - Output: `0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
  - Differences: \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57 + 36 = 57\)
  - Output: `57`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
  - Differences: \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 = 1\)
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `2`, `2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 2`
  - Differences: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
  - Output: `1`

All the test cases produce the correct output as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
