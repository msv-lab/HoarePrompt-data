Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array length is odd correctly. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, only considers pairs of elements from the sorted array, which means it will miss the last element if the array length is odd. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The sorted array is \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\). The program will only consider the pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((2, 4)\), resulting in a beauty of \(5 - 1 + 4 - 2 = 6\). However, the correct maximum beauty should be \(4 - 1 + 5 - 2 + 3 - 3 = 6\), which includes all elements. The program fails to include the middle element when the array length is odd, leading to an incorrect result.
