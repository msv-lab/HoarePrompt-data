Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0; `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `nums[0]` from it.
- `nums[0]` is initially set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
- Therefore, the new value of `k` is `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`.
- The values of `n` and the structure of `nums` remain unchanged.
