### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number that can be represented with the number of bits equal to the bit length of `k` minus one. This ensures that `nums[0]` has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - It then subtracts `nums[0]` from `k` to account for the value already used.
   - The function iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` (from index 1 to `n-1`):
     - For each element, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`.
     - It subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining `k` to the first element `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Sum Condition**:
  - The sum of the elements in `nums` must equal `k`.
  - The function ensures this by initially setting `nums[0]` to a large value and then distributing the remaining `k` among the other elements. Any leftover `k` is added back to `nums[0]`.

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation**:
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the bit length of `k` minus one. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.
  - The remaining elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This ensures that the remaining elements are as large as possible without exceeding the remaining `k`, thus potentially adding more 1s to the overall bitwise OR.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `k` is 0 after setting `nums[0]`, the remaining elements are all set to 0, which is correct.
  - If `k` is small, the function will still distribute the values correctly, ensuring the sum condition is met.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
