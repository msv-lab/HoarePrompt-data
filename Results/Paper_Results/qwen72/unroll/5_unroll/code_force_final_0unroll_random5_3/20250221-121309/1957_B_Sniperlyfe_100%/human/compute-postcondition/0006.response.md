Output State: **`nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) (unchanged), and the remaining elements filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. `k` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums[0] += k` attempts to increment the first element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`.
- Since `k` is 0, the value of `nums[0]` remains unchanged.
- The remaining elements of `nums` and the value of `k` are not affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with `nums[0]` remaining \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and `k` still being 0.
