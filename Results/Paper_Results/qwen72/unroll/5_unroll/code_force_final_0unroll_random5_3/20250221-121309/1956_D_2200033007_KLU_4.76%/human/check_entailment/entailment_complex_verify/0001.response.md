Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual elements, and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers, which is a significant issue. The correct way to handle this would be to convert each element to an integer before appending.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because the function `func_1` should be called with the actual array `a`, not its length.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take one parameter `c`, which is the length of the array.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements and those elements are `[0, 1]`, as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array has three elements and those elements are `[1, 3, 9]`, as shown in the second example.
   - However, the function does not handle other lengths (e.g., 1, 4, 5, etc.) or other specific values of the elements. It does not compute the MEX for the array or perform the operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths.

4. **Output**:
   - For `c == 2`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct for the specific case where the array is `[0, 1]`.
   - For `c != 2`, the output `13 0` is correct for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]`.
   - The program does not provide a general solution for other valid inputs. It fails to handle cases where the array length is not 2 or 3, and it does not compute the MEX or perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum for those cases.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before the function call and the behavior within the function.
   - The annotations also correctly note that the function does not return any value and that the list `c` remains unchanged after the function call.
   - The annotations highlight that the function only handles the specific cases where the array length is 2 or 3, and does not handle other lengths or values.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. It only handles specific cases and fails to provide a general solution.

Final: **False**
