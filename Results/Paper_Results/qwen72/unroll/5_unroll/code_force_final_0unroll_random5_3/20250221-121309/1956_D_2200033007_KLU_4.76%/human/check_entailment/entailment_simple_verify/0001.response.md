Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual elements, and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers, which is a critical error. The correct approach would be to convert each element to an integer before appending.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because `func_1` should be called with the array `a` itself, not its length.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take one parameter `c`, which is supposed to be the length of the array. However, the function is not designed to handle the array itself, but rather just the length.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array is `[0, 1]` because the MEX of the array `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` results in the array `[2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`. This is only correct for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]` because the sum of the elements is already `13` and no operations are needed. However, this is not a general solution and does not handle other lengths or other arrays of the same length.

4. **Output**:
   - For `c == 2`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct for the specific case `[0, 1]`.
   - For `c != 2`, the output `13 0` is only correct for the specific case `[1, 3, 9]` and does not generalize to other arrays.

The program is **not** correct for all possible inputs. It fails to handle arrays of lengths other than 2 and 3, and it does not compute the MEX for the array or perform the operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths. Additionally, the input handling is flawed because the elements are stored as strings, not integers.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's limitations and incorrectness.

Final: **False**
