You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each element is between 0 and 10^7. It prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of `c` is 2, or "13 0" otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the list `c` remains unchanged after the function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual elements, and appends them to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take one parameter `c`, which is the length of the array.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`. This is the correct output for the case where the array has three elements, as shown in the second example.

4. **Output**:
   - For `c == 2`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct because the MEX of the array `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` results in the array `[2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.
   - For `c != 2`, the output `13 0` is correct for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]` because the sum of the elements is already `13` and no operations are needed.

However, the program is **not** correct for all possible inputs. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the array length is 2 or 3, and it does not handle other lengths (e.g., 1, 4, 5, etc.). Additionally, it does not compute the MEX for the array or perform the operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
