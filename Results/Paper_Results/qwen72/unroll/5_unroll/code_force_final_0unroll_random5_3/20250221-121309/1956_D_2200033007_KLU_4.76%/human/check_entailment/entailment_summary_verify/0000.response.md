Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the problem description in a general way. Instead, it only handles two specific cases (array length of 2 and other lengths) with hardcoded outputs, which is not sufficient to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input array and stores it in the list `a`. However, it does not convert the elements from strings to integers, which is necessary for performing arithmetic operations.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a`. It only prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array:
   - If the length is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - For any other length, it prints "13 0".

3. **General Solution**: The problem requires a general solution that can handle any array of length between 1 and 18, and any integers between 0 and 10^7. The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray, nor does it perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     However, the program will output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     This is clearly incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
   - Compute the MEX of subarrays.
   - Apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array elements.
   - Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The provided program does not implement any of these steps, and thus it cannot be considered correct.

Final: **False**
