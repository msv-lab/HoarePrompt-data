### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient and appropriate for handling multiple test cases.
   - The index is initialized to 0 and is used to read the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, the program correctly reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b` from the list, incrementing the index accordingly.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`. This ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order and are unique.
   - The dictionary `char_map` is constructed to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character in the list. This is done by iterating over the list and mapping `unique_chars[i]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
   - The decoding process uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`. This is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem statement.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "w", the unique characters list will be ["w"], and the `char_map` will map "w" to "w", resulting in the correct output "w".
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "ttf", the unique characters list will be ["f", "t"], and the `char_map` will map "f" to "t" and "t" to "f", resulting in the correct output "fft".
   - The program handles the case where the encoded string has all distinct characters. For example, if the encoded string is "algorithm", the unique characters list will be ["a", "g", "h", "i", "l", "m", "o", "r", "t"], and the `char_map` will map each character to its symmetric character, resulting in the correct output "algorithm".

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading**:
  - The program's input handling is correct and efficient. It reads the input in a batch, which is suitable for large inputs and multiple test cases.
  - The index is incremented correctly to move through the input list, ensuring that each test case is processed in the correct order.

- **Decoding Logic**:
  - The `func_1` function correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order.
  - The dictionary `char_map` is constructed to map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list. This is the reverse of the encoding process, where each character is replaced by its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters.
  - The decoding process uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string, which is the correct approach to reverse the encoding.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the encoded string has all distinct characters, ensuring that the decoding process is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input efficiently, constructs the necessary mappings, and decodes the strings accurately.
