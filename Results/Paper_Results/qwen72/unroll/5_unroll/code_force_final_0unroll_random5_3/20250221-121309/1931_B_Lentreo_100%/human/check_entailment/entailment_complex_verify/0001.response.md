### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount is divisible by `n` using `total % n != 0`. However, as the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations using `mean = total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - The key point is that if at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water that needs to be poured into the containers exceeds the amount that can be poured from the containers with a lower index. This is because the operation only allows pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water that needs to be poured into the containers can always be balanced by the amount that can be poured from the containers with a lower index, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list.
  - This is consistent with the problem description and guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`.

- **State within the function:**
  - `n` is the length of `nums`.
  - `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`.
  - `total % n` is equal to 0, which is guaranteed by the problem description.
  - `mean` is the mean amount of water each container should have.
  - `curr` is initialized to 0 and is used to track the cumulative difference from the mean.
  - For each container, `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
  - If `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to balance the water amounts.
  - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to balance the water amounts.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and correctly implements the required checks to determine if it is possible to balance the water amounts in the containers. The unnecessary check for `total % n != 0` does not affect the correctness of the program, as it will always be false due to the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
