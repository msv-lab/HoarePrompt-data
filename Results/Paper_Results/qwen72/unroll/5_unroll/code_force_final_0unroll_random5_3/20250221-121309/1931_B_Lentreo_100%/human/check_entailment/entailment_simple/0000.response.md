### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function first calculates the length of the list `n` and the total sum of the water amounts `total`.
   - It checks if the total sum `total` is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water `mean` that each container should have if they are to be equal.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in a container and the mean.
   - The program iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container cannot be poured into a later container to achieve the mean, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic of the function is based on the idea that if the cumulative difference `curr` ever becomes negative, it is impossible to balance the containers using the given operation (pouring from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index).
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of water amounts is divisible by the number of containers, but this check is redundant because the problem guarantees this condition.
   - The function correctly calculates the mean and iterates through the containers to check if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative.
   - If the cumulative difference never becomes negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water, which is the correct behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
