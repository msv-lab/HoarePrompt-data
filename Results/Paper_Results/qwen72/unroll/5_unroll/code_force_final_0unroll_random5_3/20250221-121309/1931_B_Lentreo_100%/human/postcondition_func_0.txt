The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It checks if the list can be balanced such that the cumulative difference from the mean of the list never becomes negative. If the list cannot be balanced, it returns 'NO'. If the list can be balanced, it returns 'YES'.
