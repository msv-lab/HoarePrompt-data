The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3, where `freq` is a dictionary that maps each unique stick length to its frequency in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers representing stick lengths, and returns the sum of the integer division of each stick length's frequency by 3.**
