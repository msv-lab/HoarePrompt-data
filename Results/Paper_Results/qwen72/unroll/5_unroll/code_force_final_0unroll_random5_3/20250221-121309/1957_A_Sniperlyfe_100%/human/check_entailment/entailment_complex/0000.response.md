Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. However, the function currently returns the sum of the integer division of each stick length's frequency by 3. This approach assumes that each polygon must have at least 3 sides, but it does not account for the fact that different polygons can have different numbers of sides (e.g., a square has 4 sides, a pentagon has 5 sides, etc.).

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with that length by dividing the frequency by the number of sides of the polygon (which can be 3, 4, 5, etc.).
3. Sum the maximum number of polygons for all stick lengths.

The current implementation only considers polygons with 3 sides, which is incorrect for the problem statement that allows for polygons with any number of sides.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the function should be modified to consider all possible polygon side counts and choose the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, v + 1):
            max_polygons += v // sides
    
    return max_polygons
```

This version of the function will correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.
