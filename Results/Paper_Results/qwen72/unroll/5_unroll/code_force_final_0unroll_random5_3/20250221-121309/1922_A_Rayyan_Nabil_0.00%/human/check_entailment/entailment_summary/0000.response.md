Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. However, the implementation has a logical flaw that affects its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different from the character at position `i` in `c`.

3. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The program sets `l` to 'YES' if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is met for any position `i`.
   - However, it does not reset `l` to 'YES' at the beginning of each test case, which means the value of `l` from the previous test case can affect the current test case.
   - Additionally, the program prints 'NO' only if the condition is not met for all positions, which is incorrect. It should print 'NO' if the condition is not met for any position.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For each test case, `l` should be reset to 'YES' at the beginning.
   - The program should check if for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as `c[i]`. If this condition is met, it should immediately set `l` to 'NO' and break out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `l` to 'NO', then it should print 'YES'.

Given the logical flaw, the program does not correctly determine the existence of a template `t` for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
