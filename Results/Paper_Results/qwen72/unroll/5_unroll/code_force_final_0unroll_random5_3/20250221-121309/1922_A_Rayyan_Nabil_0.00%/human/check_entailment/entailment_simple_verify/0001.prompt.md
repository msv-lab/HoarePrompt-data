You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: t is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, l is 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` using a loop.
   - It checks if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c` at that position.
   - If the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds for any position `i`, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `l` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Template Matching:**
  - The program sets `l` to 'YES' if it finds any position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.
  - A valid template must ensure that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) can match the template, while `c[i]` cannot match the template.
  - The current logic does not check if a valid template can be constructed for all positions.

### Correct Logic:
- For each position `i`:
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then the template must have a lowercase letter that matches `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then the template can have either `a[i]` or `b[i]` as lowercase, and the other as uppercase.
  - `c[i]` must not match the template, meaning:
    - If the template has a lowercase letter, `c[i]` must be different.
    - If the template has an uppercase letter, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of that letter.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                # Template must have a lowercase letter that matches a[i] and b[i]
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                # Template can have either a[i] or b[i] as lowercase, and the other as uppercase
                if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        print("YES" if possible else "NO")
```

### Explanation:
- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have the same lowercase letter at position `i`. If `c[i]` is the same as this letter, it cannot match the template, so we set `possible` to `False`.
- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can have either `a[i]` or `b[i]` as lowercase, and the other as uppercase. If `c[i]` is the same as both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it cannot match the template, so we set `possible` to `False`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic for determining if a valid template exists. The corrected program above should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
