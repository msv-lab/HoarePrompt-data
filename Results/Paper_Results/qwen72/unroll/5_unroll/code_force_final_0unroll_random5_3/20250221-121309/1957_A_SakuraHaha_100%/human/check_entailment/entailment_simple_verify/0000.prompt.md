You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The variable `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0. The variable `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` is 8, `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 8



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of sticks of a certain length is not a multiple of 3 but can still form a polygon. For example, if there are 4 sticks of the same length, the program will only count 1 polygon, whereas it should count 1 polygon (since 4 sticks can form a square, which is a regular polygon with 4 sides). This is a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description. 

Example input:
```
1
4
2 2 2 2
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1
```

However, the program will fail in a case like this:
```
1
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1
```

The program should be able to recognize that 5 sticks of the same length can form one regular polygon (a pentagon) and output 1, but it incorrectly outputs 1 because it only counts the number of groups of 3 sticks, not considering the possibility of forming polygons with more sides.
