You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' that has been added to `s`. The `char_count` array, which is used internally, tracks the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`. After the function concludes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the string `s` is the final output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly reconstructs a string based on the given trace. The function `func_1` iterates through the trace array `a` and for each element `a[i]`, it finds the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count matches `a[i]`. It then appends this character to the string `s` and increments the count for that character. This approach ensures that the string `s` is constructed such that the trace of `s` matches the input trace `a`.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- Single character strings.
- Strings where all characters are the same.
- Strings with varying characters and corresponding trace values.

Since the problem guarantees that a valid string exists for the given trace, the program will always produce a valid output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
