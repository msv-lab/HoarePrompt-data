Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The function uses a large prime number \(10^9 + 7\) (stored in `M`) for all modulo operations, which is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The variable `a` is used to store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is correctly calculated by summing up `f_i` for each pair.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends. The current loop incorrectly multiplies `c` by `i` and `m`, which does not reflect the correct expected value.

6. **Correct Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value for each excursion can be calculated as follows:
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends being chosen is `c * (a + i)`, where `i` is the number of previous excursions.
   - The total expected value for `k` excursions is the sum of these expected increases.

7. **Loop Fix**: The loop should be simplified to:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
   ```

8. **Output**: The function correctly prints the result `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

Given the incorrect calculation inside the loop, the program does not correctly compute the expected value as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
