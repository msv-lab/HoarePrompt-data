Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` is incorrect. The program attempts to update the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` in each iteration of the loop, which does not align with the problem description.

The correct approach should consider the expected value of the friendship values being chosen in each excursion. For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs divided by the total number of pairs (which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`), plus the number of friend pairs `m` divided by the total number of pairs. This should be done for each of the `k` excursions.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * a + c * m) % M
            a = (a + m) % M
        print(s)
```

This implementation correctly updates the sum `s` and the total friendship value `a` for each excursion, ensuring that the expected value is calculated correctly. The original program fails to do this, leading to incorrect results.
