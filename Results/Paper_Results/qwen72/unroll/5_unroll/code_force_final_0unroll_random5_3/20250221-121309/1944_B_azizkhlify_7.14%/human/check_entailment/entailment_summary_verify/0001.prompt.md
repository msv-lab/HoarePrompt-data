You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs or single elements from `a` based on specific conditions. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the output for each test case will be the elements printed according to the conditions specified within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of `a` and stores them in `r`.

3. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct the subset `l` by iterating through the first half of `a` and selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the first half.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count `ul` to keep track of how many elements have been selected for `l`.
   - If the required number of elements (2k) is not yet reached, it continues to select elements that appear exactly once in the first half and stores them in `res`.

4. **Constructing Subset `r`:**
   - The program then constructs the subset `r` by iterating through the second half of `a` and selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the second half.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count `ur` to keep track of how many elements have been selected for `r`.
   - The program ensures that the number of elements selected for `l` and `r` is the same.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `k` is within the valid range.
   - It also ensures that the total number of elements selected for `l` and `r` is `2k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Counting and Selection:**
  - The program uses `l` and `r` arrays to count occurrences, but it does not correctly handle the selection of elements for the subsets.
  - The logic for selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the first half and then selecting elements that appear exactly once is flawed.
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` is the same.

- **Incorrect Use of `ul` and `ur`:**
  - The program uses `ul` and `ur` to track the number of elements selected for `l` and `r`, but it does not correctly initialize or update these variables.
  - The condition `if ul != ur` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect behavior.

- **Incorrect Handling of `res`:**
  - The `res` list is used to store elements that appear exactly once in the first half, but it is not used correctly to ensure the XOR condition.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for selecting elements and ensuring the XOR condition is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
