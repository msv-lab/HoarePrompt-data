Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.
