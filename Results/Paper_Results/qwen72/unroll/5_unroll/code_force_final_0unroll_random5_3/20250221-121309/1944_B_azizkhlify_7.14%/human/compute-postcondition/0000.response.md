The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range determined by the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases. The state before the loop starts already specifies that the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, which means the input should be a positive integer within this range to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer within the specified range, and the loop counter `_` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`_` is 0, the input must be a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
