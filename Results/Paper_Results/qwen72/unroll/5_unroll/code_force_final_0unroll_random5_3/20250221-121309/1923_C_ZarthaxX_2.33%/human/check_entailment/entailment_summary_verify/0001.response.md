### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Within `func_1()`, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in the array `nums`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i-1]`.
   - `sum[i]` is the sum of `nums[0:i-1] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to replace the single element with a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.
   - For other queries, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray `c[l:r]` using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
   - This condition can be simplified to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` can be split into a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `c`.

### Simplified Condition Explanation:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is the number of elements in the subarray that are not 1.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray, which is the total sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
- The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for a different positive integer for each element.

### Verification of the Condition:
- For a subarray to be good, we need to ensure that there exists a different positive integer for each element in the subarray while maintaining the same sum.
- The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` is derived from the requirement that the sum of the subarray must be at least the number of elements in the subarray plus the number of 1s in the subarray. This is because each 1 in the subarray needs to be replaced by a different positive integer, and the remaining elements (which are not 1) also need to be replaced by different positive integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, preprocesses the array, and checks the condition for each query. The logic and the condition used to determine if a subarray is good are accurate and follow the problem description.
