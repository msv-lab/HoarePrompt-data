The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `c` is a list of positive integers.
- `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
