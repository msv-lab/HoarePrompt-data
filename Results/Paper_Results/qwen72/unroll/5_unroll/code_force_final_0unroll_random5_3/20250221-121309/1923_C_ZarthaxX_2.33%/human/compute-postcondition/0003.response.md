Output State: **`n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `c` is a list of positive integers, `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes a new list `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.
- The initial values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `queries`, `nums`, and `ones` remain unchanged.
- The new list `sum` has the same length as `ones`, which is `n + 1`, and all elements are 0.
