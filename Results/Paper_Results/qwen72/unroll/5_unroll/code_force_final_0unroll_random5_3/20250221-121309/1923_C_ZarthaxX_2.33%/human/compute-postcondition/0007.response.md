To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop and the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1`.
- `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1` and 1.
- `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `q` times.
- In each iteration, it reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input.
- If `l` is equal to `r`, it prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration.
- Otherwise, it calculates:
  - `onesInRange` as the number of 1s in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
  - `sumInRange` as the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the `nums` list from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and 1.
- It then checks if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
  - If true, it prints 'YES'.
  - If false, it prints 'NO'.

### Output State:
- The variables `ones` and `sum` are not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` are not modified within the loop.
- The loop only performs input and output operations, so the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.**
