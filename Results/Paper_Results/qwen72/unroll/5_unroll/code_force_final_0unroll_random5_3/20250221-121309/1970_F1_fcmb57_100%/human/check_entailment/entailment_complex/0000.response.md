Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field and initializes the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - It correctly identifies the positions of the players and goals from the input grid.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the movement of players using the `func_1` function, which updates the player's position based on the direction of movement.
   - The `func_1` function is defined to take the current position and the movement direction, and it returns the new position. This function is correctly implemented and will not raise a `ValueError` because the movement directions are guaranteed to be valid.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal position when they throw the Quaffle.
   - It correctly increments the score for the opposing team if a player scores in the wrong goal.
   - It prints the appropriate goal message and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Final Score Output**:
   - The program prints the final score at the end of the game, which is the correct final step.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in their own goal by correctly awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle is always placed back in the middle of the field after a goal, though this is not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the problem statement and the example outputs.

6. **Overall Flow**:
   - The program follows the correct sequence of actions: parsing the field, processing each move, and updating the score and output accordingly.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no obvious errors or issues that would cause the program to fail or produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
