The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. It is intended to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, the function will raise a `ValueError` if `a` or `b` cannot be unpacked into two values. If the unpacking is successful, the function returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which represents the new coordinates after applying the changes `dx` and `dy` to the original coordinates `x` and `y`.
