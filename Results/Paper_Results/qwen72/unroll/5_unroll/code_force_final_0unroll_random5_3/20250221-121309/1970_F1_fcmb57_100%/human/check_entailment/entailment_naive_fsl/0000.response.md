Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the scoring mechanism. Specifically, the program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals for the scoring team, but it does not account for the possibility that a player might score in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should get the point. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the following input where a red player scores in a red goal:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 U
R0 U
R0 L
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```
In this case, the red player R0 should score in the blue goal, but if the red player R0 ends up in a red goal and throws the Quaffle, the program will incorrectly increment the red team's score instead of the blue team's score. This violates the problem description, which states that if a player scores in their own goal, the other team wins the point.
