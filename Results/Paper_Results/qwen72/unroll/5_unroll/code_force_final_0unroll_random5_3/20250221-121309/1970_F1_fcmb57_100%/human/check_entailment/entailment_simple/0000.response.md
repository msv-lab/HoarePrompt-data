### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes dictionaries for `players` and `goals` and a dictionary for movement directions (`mouvements`).
   - It reads the field and correctly identifies the positions of players and goals, storing them in the respective dictionaries.

2. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for updating the coordinates of a player based on the movement direction.
   - The function correctly calculates the new coordinates by adding the movement direction to the current coordinates.
   - However, the function name `func_1` is not descriptive and could be improved for clarity, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves (`moves`) and processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the move is a movement (`'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, `'R'`) or a throw (`'T'`).
   - If the move is a movement, it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
   - If the move is a throw, it checks if the player is at a goal position and updates the score accordingly.
   - The program correctly prints the event when a goal is scored and the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player throws the Quaffle at a goal.
   - It updates the score for the correct team based on the goal type and the player's team.
   - It prints the event and the final score as required.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in their own goal by awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle returns to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, although this is not explicitly shown in the code (it is assumed to be handled by the input constraints).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct events and the final score in the required format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the movement of players, the scoring of goals, and the final score output as required. The function `func_1` is used correctly to update player positions, and the scoring logic is implemented accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
