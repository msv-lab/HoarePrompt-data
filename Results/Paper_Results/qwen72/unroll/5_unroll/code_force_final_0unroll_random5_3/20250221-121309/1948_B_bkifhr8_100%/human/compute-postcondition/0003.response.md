The function `func` should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The integers in the list `a` should be between 0 and 99, and the length `n` should be between 2 and 50. The function returns different outputs based on the input values.

- Case_1: If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 50, the function returns an error message indicating that the length of the list is invalid.
- Case_2: If any integer in the list `a` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function returns an error message indicating that the list contains invalid integers.
- Case_3: If the input is valid, the function processes the list `a` and returns the result based on the specific logic for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` for the number of test cases, an integer `n` for the length of the list, and a list of integers `a`. If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 50, it returns an error message indicating an invalid list length. If any integer in `a` is less than 0 or greater than 99, it returns an error message indicating invalid integers in the list. If the input is valid, it processes the list `a` and returns the result based on the specific logic for each test case.**
