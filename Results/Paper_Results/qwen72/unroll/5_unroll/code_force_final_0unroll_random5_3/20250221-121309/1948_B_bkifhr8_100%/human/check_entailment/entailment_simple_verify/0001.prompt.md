You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, so it should accept an integer `t` for the number of test cases. The integers in the list `a` should be between 0 and 99, and the length `n` should be between 2 and 50.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. After processing the list, it prints 'YES' if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function assumes that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The function iterates backward through the array from the second last element to the first element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This is a good approach because if an element is out of order, it needs to be checked against the previous element to see if it can be split to make the array sorted.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, the function checks if the previous element can be split into its digits and still maintain a sorted order.
   - The previous element `arr[i - 1]` is split into its digits and combined with the current element `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - The function then checks if `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(nums)`.

5. **Update Array:**
   - If `nums` is sorted, the function updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`).

6. **Output:**
   - If at any point the array cannot be made sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, the function prints `YES` if `ans` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Comparison:**
  - The function splits the previous element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and combines it with the current element `arr[i]` to form `nums`.
  - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in the same position as the original element.
  - For example, if `arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and combine it with `3` to form `[1, 2, 3]`. This is not the correct way to handle the operation as described in the problem.

- **Incorrect Update:**
  - The function updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number, which is not the correct way to handle the operation.
  - The correct approach should be to replace `arr[i - 1]` with the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and then check if the array can be sorted.

### Correct Approach:
- **Split and Insert Digits:**
  - For each element `arr[i - 1]` that is at least 10, split it into its digits and insert them in the same position.
  - After splitting, check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required operation and logic to determine if the array can be sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
