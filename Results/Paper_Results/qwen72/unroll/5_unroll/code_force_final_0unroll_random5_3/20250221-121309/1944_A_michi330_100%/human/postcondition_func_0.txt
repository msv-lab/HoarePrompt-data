The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). The function then prints either 1 or `n` for each test case, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged.
