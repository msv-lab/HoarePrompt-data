The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
