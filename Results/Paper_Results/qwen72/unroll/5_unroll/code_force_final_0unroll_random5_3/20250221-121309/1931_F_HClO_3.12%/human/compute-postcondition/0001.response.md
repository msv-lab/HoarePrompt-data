The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Since `t` is given to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute at least once if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is typically used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
