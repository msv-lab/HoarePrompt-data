Correctness: **True**

The program provided is designed to solve the problem of determining if there is a consistent order of participants in a chat based on the screenshots posted by the participants. The solution works by checking the consistency between the first two screenshots and then validating the rest of the screenshots against the determined order. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program immediately prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always correspond to some order of participants.

3. **Initial Comparison**: The program reads the first two screenshots and removes the author of the second screenshot from the first list and the author of the first screenshot from the second list. It then checks if these modified lists are equal. If they are not, the program prints "no" and moves to the next test case, as the orders cannot be consistent.

4. **Finding the Insertion Point**: If the modified lists are equal, the program determines the relative positions of the authors of the first two screenshots in the original lists. It identifies the indices where the authors should be inserted to make the lists consistent.

5. **Handling Two Screenshots**: If there are only two screenshots (`m == 2`), the program prints "yes" because the order has already been validated by the initial comparison.

6. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**: For more than two screenshots, the program reads the remaining screenshots and checks if they are consistent with the determined order. It does this by comparing each screenshot to the list `l` (which is either `l1` or `l2` with the appropriate author inserted) after removing the author of the current screenshot.

7. **Output**: The program prints "yes" if all the screenshots are consistent with the determined order, otherwise it prints "no".

The logic and steps in the program are well-thought-out and correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
