Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a chat scenario with `n` participants and `k` participants who posted screenshots. For each test case, it reads the order of participants as seen by each screenshot author and determines whether the order of participants can be consistently rearranged to match across all screenshots. The function outputs 'yes' if the orders can be consistently rearranged, and 'no' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function's final state is a series of 'yes' or 'no' outputs corresponding to each test case. **
