Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` will be reset or updated for each iteration of the loop, but their final values after the loop completes are not relevant to the output state. The output state will be a series of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, indicating whether the conditions for the chat participants' order are met.**
