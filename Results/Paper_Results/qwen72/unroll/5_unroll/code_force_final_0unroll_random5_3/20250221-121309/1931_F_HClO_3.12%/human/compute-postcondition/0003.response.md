The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `a` where each inner list represents the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted a screenshot. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not explicitly defined in the output section. Given the context, we can infer that the function likely returns some form of analysis or computation based on the input data for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`, along with the order of participants as seen by each screenshot author. It returns the results of the analysis or computation for each test case.**
