You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` where the characters are ordered by their depth in the parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the balance is calculated and used for sorting. The program uses a dictionary `d` to store the balance at each position but starts with `d[0] = 0` and then updates `d[i + 1]` for each character in the string. This approach is incorrect because it does not properly account for the balance of the prefix before each character.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balance table should be:

| Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Position      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Character     | ( | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ) | ) |

However, the program incorrectly calculates the balance as follows:

| Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Position      | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| Character     |   | ( | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ) |

This leads to an incorrect sorting of the positions and, consequently, an incorrect result. The program should initialize the balance correctly and use the correct positions for sorting. A correct implementation would involve calculating the balance at each position and then sorting the positions based on the balance and position as described in the problem.
