Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at index `i-1` for `i` in the range 1 to `n`, and `d[n+1]` is 0.**

The key impact of the code `d.pop(n)` is that the entry for the key `n` in the dictionary `d` is removed. The other variables and their properties remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now only contains entries for indices from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the entry for `d[n+1]` remains 0.
