You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at index `i-1` for `i` in the range 1 to `n+1`, and `d[n+1]` is 0.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing the characters of `s` rearranged in such a way that the characters are ordered by their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`, and `d` remains a sorted list of tuples containing indices and their corresponding depths.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans`, which contains the characters of `s` rearranged in such a way that the characters are ordered by their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` using `input()`. This is appropriate as the problem specifies that the input is a string.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to perform the balanced shuffle operation on the input string `s`.

3. **Balance Calculation**:
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to store the prefix balances.
   - The initial balance is set to 0 (`d[0] = 0`).
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part correctly calculates the prefix balances for the input string.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The last entry in the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the balance of the entire string) is removed using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance of the entire string is not needed for the sorting step.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the prefix balances (`x[1]`), and for ties, the positions are sorted in decreasing order (`x[0]`).

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The sorted dictionary `d` is iterated over, and the characters from the input string `s` are appended to the result string `ans` based on the sorted positions.
   - The result string `ans` is returned.

6. **Output**:
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

However, there is a critical issue in the sorting step. The problem specifies that ties should be broken in decreasing order of position, but the current implementation sorts the positions in increasing order. This will lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the sorting key should be modified to break ties in decreasing order of position. The correct sorting key should be `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]  # Adjust index to match the position in the original string
    return ans
```

**Explanation of the Fix**:
- The sorting key is now `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`, which sorts by prefix balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order.
- The index in the loop `ans += s[i - 1]` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to match the 0-based indexing of the original string `s`.

Given the original program, the correctness is **False** due to the incorrect sorting key.

Correctness: **False**
