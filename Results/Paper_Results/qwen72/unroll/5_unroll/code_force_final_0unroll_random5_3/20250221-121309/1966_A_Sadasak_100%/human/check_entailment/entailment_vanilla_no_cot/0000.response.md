Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the operations. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This means that if a card number appears more than `k` times, the frequency is artificially limited to `k`, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. The main logic in the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` for the exchange operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards_left -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation:
- **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` now correctly counts the frequency of each card number without capping it at `k`.
- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For each card number, the program calculates how many cards can be exchanged by dividing the frequency by `k` and then multiplying by `(k - 1)`. This is because each set of `k` cards can be exchanged for `k - 1` new cards, reducing the total count by 1. The result is then subtracted from the total number of cards to find the minimum number of cards left.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
