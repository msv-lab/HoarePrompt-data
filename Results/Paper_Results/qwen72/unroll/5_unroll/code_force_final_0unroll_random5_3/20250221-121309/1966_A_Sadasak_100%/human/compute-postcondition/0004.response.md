The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100. `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and each value is the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, with the constraint that no value in the dictionary exceeds `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, ensuring that no frequency value exceeds `k`.**
