To determine what will be printed by the `print(arr, prefix)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationship between `arr` and `prefix`.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`.

### Explanation:
1. **`arr`**: This is the original list of integers.
2. **`prefix`**: This list is constructed by taking the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr`. The first element of `prefix` is `0` (the initial value), and each subsequent element is the result of XORing all elements in `arr` up to that point.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- Let's assume `arr` has elements `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`.
- The first element of `prefix` is `0`.
- The second element of `prefix` is `0 ^ a1`.
- The third element of `prefix` is `0 ^ a1 ^ a2`.
- The fourth element of `prefix` is `0 ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ a3`.
- And so on, until the last element of `prefix` which is `0 ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ ... ^ an-1`.

### Example:
If `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- `prefix[0] = 0`
- `prefix[1] = 0 ^ 1 = 1`
- `prefix[2] = 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 3`
- `prefix[3] = 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`
- `prefix[4] = 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 4`
- `prefix[5] = 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 = 1`

So, `prefix = [0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1]`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form:
- `arr` will be the original list of integers.
- `prefix` will be a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[arr], [prefix] (where `arr` is the original list of integers and `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`)**
