The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns no value. It reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then computes a `prefix` list where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`. The function also initializes two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists. `pre` is initially set to contain `[1, 0]` for each bit position, and `suf` is set to contain `[0, 0]` for each bit position. The function updates `suf` to count the number of 1s and 0s at each bit position of the elements in `prefix` from the end to the beginning. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across all elements in `prefix`. Finally, the function prints the original list `arr`, the `prefix` list, the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the computed value `ans`.
