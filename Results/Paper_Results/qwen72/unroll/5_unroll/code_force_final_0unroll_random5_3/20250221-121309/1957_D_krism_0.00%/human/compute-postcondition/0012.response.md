The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` should start from `n` and decrement to 1.

State: **`pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`. `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
