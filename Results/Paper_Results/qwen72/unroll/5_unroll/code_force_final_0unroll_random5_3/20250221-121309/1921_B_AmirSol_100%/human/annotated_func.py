#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has a '0' and `s2` has a '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1` has a '0' and `s2` has a '1', and the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0'.
