The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has a '0' and `s2` has a '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1` has a '0' and `s2` has a '1', and the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0'.**
