You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `num` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a space-separated list of integers `b`. It then sorts the list `b`, selects the first `a` integers, and appends their sum to a list `out`. After processing all test cases, it prints each integer in `out`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `num` is the input string, `a` is the last input integer read in the loop, and `out` is a list of `int(num)` integers where each integer is the sum of the first `a` sorted integers from the corresponding input list. The values of `t` and `n` are not used or modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input list has duplicate numbers correctly. Specifically, the program always selects the minimum of the pairs, but it does not ensure that the pairs are optimally chosen to maximize the score. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 2 3 3 4
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 2) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (2, 3) and add 2 to the score.
- Pair (3, 4) and add 3 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
- Selected elements: [1, 2, 3]
- Total score: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

In this case, it happens to work, but consider another input:
```
1
3
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 1) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (2, 2) and add 2 to the score.
- Pair (3, 3) and add 3 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
- Selected elements: [1, 2, 3]
- Total score: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

This case also works, but the program does not guarantee that it will always work optimally. For example, consider:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 2) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (3, 4) and add 3 to the score.
- Pair (5, 6) and add 5 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Selected elements: [1, 3, 5]
- Total score: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

This case works, but the program does not handle the case where the input list has an odd number of elements correctly. The problem description specifies that there are exactly 2n integers, but the program does not enforce this constraint. If the input list has an odd number of elements, the program will still attempt to process it, leading to incorrect behavior. For example:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5
```
This input is invalid according to the problem description, but the program will still attempt to process it, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
