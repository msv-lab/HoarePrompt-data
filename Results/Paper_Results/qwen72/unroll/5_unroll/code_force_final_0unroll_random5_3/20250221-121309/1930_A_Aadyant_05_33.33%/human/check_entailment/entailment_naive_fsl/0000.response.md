Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input list has duplicate numbers correctly. Specifically, the program always selects the minimum of the pairs, but it does not ensure that the pairs are optimally chosen to maximize the score. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 2 3 3 4
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 2) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (2, 3) and add 2 to the score.
- Pair (3, 4) and add 3 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
- Selected elements: [1, 2, 3]
- Total score: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

In this case, it happens to work, but consider another input:
```
1
3
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 1) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (2, 2) and add 2 to the score.
- Pair (3, 3) and add 3 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
- Selected elements: [1, 2, 3]
- Total score: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

This case also works, but the program does not guarantee that it will always work optimally. For example, consider:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
The optimal way to pair the numbers to maximize the score would be:
- Pair (1, 2) and add 1 to the score.
- Pair (3, 4) and add 3 to the score.
- Pair (5, 6) and add 5 to the score.

The total score would be 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

However, the program will sort the list and then take every second element:
- Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Selected elements: [1, 3, 5]
- Total score: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

This case works, but the program does not handle the case where the input list has an odd number of elements correctly. The problem description specifies that there are exactly 2n integers, but the program does not enforce this constraint. If the input list has an odd number of elements, the program will still attempt to process it, leading to incorrect behavior. For example:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5
```
This input is invalid according to the problem description, but the program will still attempt to process it, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
