Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the periodicities of the signs (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a test case.
