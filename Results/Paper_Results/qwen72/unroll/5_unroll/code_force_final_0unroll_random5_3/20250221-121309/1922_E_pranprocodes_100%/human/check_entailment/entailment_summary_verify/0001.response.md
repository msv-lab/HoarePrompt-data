### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \( -10^8 \), which are the upper and lower bounds for the elements in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array and a counter `t` to keep track of the length of the array.
   - The program enters a loop where it continues to modify \( X \) until \( X \) becomes 1.
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` to ensure the elements are in the correct order.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the array and the array itself.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program's approach of appending `max` for even \( X \) and `min` for odd \( X \) is a heuristic to ensure the array can be constructed with the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \):** The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly. When \( X \) is 1, the program should print 1 and a single element (e.g., 0), but it does not do so. This is a clear issue.
   - **Feasibility Check:** The program does not check if \( X \) is feasible with an array of length 200. This is a potential issue because the program does not ensure that the array length does not exceed 200. If \( X \) is too large, the program may generate an array longer than 200, which is not allowed.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \):** The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1 by printing 1 and a single element.
   - **Feasibility Check:** The program should check if \( X \) is feasible with an array of length 200. If \( X \) is too large, it should print -1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 and does not check the feasibility of \( X \) with an array of length 200.
