Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when \( X = 1 \). According to the problem description, the array should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. For \( X = 1 \), the only valid array is one that has exactly one increasing subsequence, which is an array with a single element. However, the program does not handle this case and will output an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1
```
The program will not output the correct result, which should be:
```
1
0
```
Instead, it will enter an infinite loop or produce an incorrect output because the condition `while x != 1` will never be met for \( x = 1 \).
