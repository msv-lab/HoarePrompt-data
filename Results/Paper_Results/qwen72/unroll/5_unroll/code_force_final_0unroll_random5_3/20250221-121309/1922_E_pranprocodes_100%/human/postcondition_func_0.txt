The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and generates a list of integers `ans` such that the list has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of the list `t` and then the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. If no such list can be generated, it does not handle this case and will not return -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
