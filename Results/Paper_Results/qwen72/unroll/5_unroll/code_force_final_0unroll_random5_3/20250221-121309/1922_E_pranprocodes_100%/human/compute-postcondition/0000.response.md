To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the only object that affects the loop's execution is the result of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
