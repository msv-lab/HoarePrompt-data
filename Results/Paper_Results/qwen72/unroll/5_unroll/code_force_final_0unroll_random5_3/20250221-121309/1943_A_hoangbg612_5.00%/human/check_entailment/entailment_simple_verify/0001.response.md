### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a crucial step because it allows us to process the elements in increasing order, which is necessary for computing the MEX.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value as we iterate through the sorted array.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each element in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the sorted array `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. This step is indeed unnecessary because the MEX calculation should be based on the elements in `c`, not the original array `N`.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any integer `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This step is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues:
- The program incorrectly updates the MEX value by checking the sum of counts in `M` and comparing it to `S`. This is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
- The final loop that updates `cur` based on the counts in `M` is also incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the elements in `c`, not by the counts in `M`.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice and Bob are playing optimally, so Alice will always try to pick the smallest available element that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.
- The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` and is not the next smallest element that Bob would pick.
- The optimal strategy for Bob is to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
- The MEX calculation is incorrect and does not follow the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game's logic and the MEX calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
