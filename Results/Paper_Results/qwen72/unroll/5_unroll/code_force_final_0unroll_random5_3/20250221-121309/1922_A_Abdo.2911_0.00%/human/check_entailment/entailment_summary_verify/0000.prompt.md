You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the string `c` matches a template derived from `a` and `b` according to specific rules: the template is constructed by copying characters from `a` and `b` where they match, and using uppercase characters where they differ. The function prints 'YES' if `c` matches the template and `a` and `b` do not conflict with the template, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the template and verifying the matches is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the failure:
- The program constructs the template as follows:
  - For the first character, `a` and `d` are different, so it appends `A` to the template.
  - For the second character, `b` and `e` are different, so it appends `B` to the template.
  - For the third character, `c` and `f` are different, so it appends `C` to the template.
  - The resulting template is `ABC`.

- The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
  - `a` does not match `ABC` because `a` is not equal to `A`, `b` is not equal to `B`, and `c` is not equal to `C`.
  - `b` does not match `ABC` for the same reasons.

- The program also checks if `c` does not match the template:
  - `c` does not match `ABC` because `g` is not equal to `A`, `h` is not equal to `B`, and `i` is not equal to `C`.

Since both `a` and `b` do not match the template, and `c` also does not match the template, the program incorrectly prints `NO`.

However, there exists a valid template `abc` (all lowercase) that `a` and `b` can match (since they are different), and `c` does not match (since it is different from `a` and `b`). Therefore, the correct output should be `YES`.
