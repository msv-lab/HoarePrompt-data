Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each test case, the program has checked if the string `c` matches the template derived from strings `a` and `b` according to the specified rules. If `c` matches the template and `a` and `b` do not conflict with the template, the program has printed 'YES'. Otherwise, it has printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged for each test case, but the loop has processed each test case and printed the corresponding output.**
