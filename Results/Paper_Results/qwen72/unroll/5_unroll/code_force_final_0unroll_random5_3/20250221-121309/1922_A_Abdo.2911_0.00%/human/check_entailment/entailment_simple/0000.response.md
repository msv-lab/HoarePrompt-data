### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The function constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends the lowercase character to the template.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each lowercase character in the template, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same.
     - For each uppercase character in the template, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For each lowercase character in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is the same.
     - For each uppercase character in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, appending the uppercase version of `a[i]` does not necessarily ensure that `a` and `b` will match the template. For example, if `a[i] = 'a'` and `b[i] = 'b'`, appending `'A'` to the template will not work because `b[i]` will not match the template.
  - A correct approach would be to use a different character that is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` in the uppercase form.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The condition for checking if `c` does not match the template is incorrect. The function should ensure that `c[i]` does not match the template, not that it matches.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Choose a character that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    if char != a[i] and char != b[i]:
                        template.append(char.upper())
                        break
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is correct.
- **False** if the program is incorrect.

Given the issues identified in the original program, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
