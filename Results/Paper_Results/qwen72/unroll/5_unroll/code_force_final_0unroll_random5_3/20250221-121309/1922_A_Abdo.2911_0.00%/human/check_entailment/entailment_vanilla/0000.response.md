### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `t` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds that character to the template as a lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, it adds the character from `a` to the template as an uppercase letter.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues:
- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the program adds `a[i].upper()` to the template. This is incorrect because the template should allow both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to match, but `a[i].upper()` only allows `a[i]` to match, not `b[i]`.
  - A correct approach would be to use a character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when they are different. For example, if `a[i]` is 'a' and `b[i]` is 'b', the template could use 'C' (or any other uppercase letter that is not 'A' or 'B').

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The matching conditions for `a` and `b` are correct.
  - The matching condition for `c` is incorrect. The program should ensure that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character if the template character is uppercase, and the same if the template character is lowercase.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Choose an uppercase letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                    if ch.lower() != a[i] and ch.lower() != b[i]:
                        template.append(ch)
                        break
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** due to the flawed template construction and matching conditions for `c`.
- The corrected program should be **correct** as it properly constructs the template and checks the matching conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
