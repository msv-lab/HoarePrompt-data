To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is not equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
   - Let's break down the expression:
     - `size + 1` is 2.
     - `1 << 2` is \(1 \times 2^2 = 4\).
     - So, the condition becomes \(4 - 1 \leq \text{number}\), which simplifies to \(3 \leq \text{number}\).

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The condition \(3 \leq \text{number}\) must be true for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `number` is already within a range that can satisfy the condition \(3 \leq \text{number}\) if it is at least 3.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `number` as it already satisfies the condition.
   - The variable `size` is 1, and this value is used in the condition. No adjustment is needed for `size` either.

### Conclusion:
The loop condition \(3 \leq \text{number}\) is already satisfied by the given state. No adjustments are necessary.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `size` is 1, and `number` is not equal to 0**.
