Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads three strings: `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding position in `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` does not match the corresponding characters in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop. If all characters in `c` match the corresponding characters in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will be re-assigned for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop will be those from the last test case. The variable `counter` will be reset to 0 for each test case and will end up being equal to the length of `c` if the loop does not break early. The value of `tests` will remain unchanged as `t`.**
