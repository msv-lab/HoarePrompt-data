### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the strings and the strings themselves.
2. **Initial Check**: The function checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `c` is identical to either `a` or `b`, it cannot be made to not match the template while `a` and `b` match it.
3. **Character Comparison**: The function then iterates through each character of `c` and checks if it is not present in the corresponding position in `a` or `b`. If it finds a character in `c` that is not in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. This is intended to determine if there exists a template where `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do.
4. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding a character in `c` that is not in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the character comparison part:
- The function checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`. This is incorrect because the template should be such that:
  - If the template has a lowercase letter, `a` and `b` must have the same letter in that position.
  - If the template has an uppercase letter, `a` and `b` must have different letters in that position, and `c` must have a different letter from the lowercase version of the template.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the template matching logic. It only checks if `c` has a character that is not in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The function's logic for determining if a valid template exists is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]` is not sufficient to ensure that `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do. The correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring that for each position, `a` and `b` either have the same character (for a lowercase template) or different characters (for an uppercase template).
- Ensuring that `c` does not match the template in at least one position.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        can_match = True
        for j in range(slength):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                if a[j] == c[j]:
                    can_match = False
                    break
            else:
                if a[j] == c[j] or b[j] == c[j]:
                    can_match = False
                    break
        
        if can_match:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If `a[j]` and `b[j]` are the same, `c[j]` must be different.
- If `a[j]` and `b[j]` are different, `c[j]` must be different from both `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

This correctly determines if a valid template exists for the given problem.
