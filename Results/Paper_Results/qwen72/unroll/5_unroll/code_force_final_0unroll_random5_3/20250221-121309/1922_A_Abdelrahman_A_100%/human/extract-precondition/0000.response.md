Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings a, b, and c, followed by three lines containing the strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
