The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. The function returns 'NO' in Case_1 and Case_2, and 'YES' in Case_3. Since the specific conditions for each case are not provided, we can generalize that the function evaluates the `password` based on certain criteria and returns 'NO' if the password does not meet these criteria, and 'YES' if it does.
