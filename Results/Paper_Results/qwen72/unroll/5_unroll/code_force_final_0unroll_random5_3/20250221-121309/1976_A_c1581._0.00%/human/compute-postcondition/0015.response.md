Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `password` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'NO' if the digits in the password are not in non-decreasing order, or if any letter appears after a digit and before another digit. It returns 'YES' if the digits are in non-decreasing order and all letters appear either before or after all digits. **
