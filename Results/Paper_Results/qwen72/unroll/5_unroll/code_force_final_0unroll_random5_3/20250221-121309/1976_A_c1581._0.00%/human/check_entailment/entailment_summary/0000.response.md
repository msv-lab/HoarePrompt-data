### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for handling input in competitive programming and is appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases `t` and processes each password. For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the password string.

3. **Separation of Digits and Letters:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit using `char.isdigit()`.

4. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter and before another digit. This is done by maintaining a `last_digit_index` and ensuring that if a letter is found after a digit, the function returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

5. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done using the `sorted` function and comparing the sorted lists to the original lists. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of `func_1` for each test case to a list `results` and then prints the results, each on a new line. This is consistent with the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. It handles the input and output as specified, and the checks for the conditions are implemented accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
