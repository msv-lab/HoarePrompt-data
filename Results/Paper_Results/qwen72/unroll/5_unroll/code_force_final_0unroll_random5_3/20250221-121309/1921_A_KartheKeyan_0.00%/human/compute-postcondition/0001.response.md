Output State: **The number of test cases `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the value of `s` is calculated and printed for each test case. The value of `s` is determined by the formula `s = (l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, where `l` is an integer input for each test case. The loop continues until `t` reaches 0. `n` is an input integer.**
