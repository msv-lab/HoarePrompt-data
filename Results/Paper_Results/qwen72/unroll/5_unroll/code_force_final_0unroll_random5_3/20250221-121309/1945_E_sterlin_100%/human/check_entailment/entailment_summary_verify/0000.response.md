### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input as a single string.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of strings split by whitespace.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The program needs to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it needs to read the length of the permutation `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It should then read the permutation `p`.
   - The program should perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation so that a binary search can successfully find `x`.
   - After rearranging, it should perform the binary search and output the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided functions only handle reading input. There is no logic to:
     - Perform the binary search.
     - Determine the necessary swaps to make the binary search successful.
     - Output the results as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation

The provided program is indeed incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It only contains input reading functions and does not implement the required algorithm or output the necessary results.

Final: **False**
