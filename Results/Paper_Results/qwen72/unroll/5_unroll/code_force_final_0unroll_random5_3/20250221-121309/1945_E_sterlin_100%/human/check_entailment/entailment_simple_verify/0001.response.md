### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and the goal is to ensure that `p[l] = x` after the binary search loop ends.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented in the provided code:
     - `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` to `n`.
     - The loop continues until `r - l = 1`.
     - `m` is computed as `left + (right - left) // 2` to avoid overflow.
     - If `p[mid] <= x`, `left` is updated to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Swapping Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to determine the correct positions for swaps to ensure that `x` is found correctly by the binary search.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_indx` to map each element in the permutation to its index.
   - It uses a list `seen` to track which elements have been "seen" by the binary search.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.
   - It then performs the binary search and checks if `p[left] == x`.
   - If `x` is not found at `p[left]`, it checks if `x` has been "seen" by the binary search.
   - If `x` is not "seen", it performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` is "seen" but not at the correct position, it performs two swaps to rearrange the permutation.

5. **Correctness of the Swapping Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - It correctly identifies the positions of elements that need to be swapped to ensure `x` is found by the binary search.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps is sound.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting 0 swaps.
   - It handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be placed there with a single swap.
   - It handles the case where `x` is "seen" but not in the correct position by performing two swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and solves the problem as described. It reads the input, performs the necessary swaps, and ensures that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
