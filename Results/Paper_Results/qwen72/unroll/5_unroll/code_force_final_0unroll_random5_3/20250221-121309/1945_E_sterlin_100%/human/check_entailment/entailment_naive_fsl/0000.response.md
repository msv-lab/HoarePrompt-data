Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the binary search algorithm or the logic to rearrange the permutation to ensure the binary search works correctly. It only contains placeholder functions that read input, but there is no actual logic to solve the problem as described. For example, the program does not handle the binary search process or the swapping of elements in the permutation to make the binary search successful. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
