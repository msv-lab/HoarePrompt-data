Output State: **`size` is the largest `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`, `overlap` is the corresponding `i` value, `size_overlap` is a tuple where the first element is the largest `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and the second element is the corresponding `i` value, `sequence` and `number` remain unchanged.**
