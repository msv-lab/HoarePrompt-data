### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - If no such array exists, the program should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - The sequence is then printed along with its length.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a bit manipulation approach to determine the size and overlap of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` to find a suitable size and overlap such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

4. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1`.
   - This is based on the fact that a sequence of length `i + 1` can have \( 2^{i+1} - 2^i = 2^i \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function then appends the necessary elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Recursive Call:**
   - After appending the elements, the function recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call is made with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by using a loop that iterates over possible values of `i`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints \(-1\).

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initial Check:**
  - The function starts by asserting that `number` is non-negative.
  - If `number` is 0, it returns `(0, 0)` immediately, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.

- **Finding Suitable Size and Overlap:**
  - The function iterates over possible values of `i` starting from the maximum value in the `sequence` (or 0 if the sequence is empty) and decrements `i` to -1.
  - For each `i`, it calculates the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1` using the expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`.
  - It then checks if this value is less than or equal to `number`. If it is, it updates `size` and `overlap` and breaks out of the loop.

- **Appending Elements:**
  - The function appends elements to the `sequence` from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
  - This ensures that the sequence has the required number of increasing subsequences.

- **Recursive Call:**
  - The function recursively calls itself with the updated `number` value `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.
  - This recursive call continues until `number` reaches 0.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Bit Manipulation:**
  - The bit manipulation used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences is correct. For a sequence of length `i + 1`, the number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^i \).

- **Recursive Approach:**
  - The recursive approach is sound. It correctly reduces the `number` and appends elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

- **Sequence Length:**
  - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by iterating over possible values of `i` and breaking out of the loop when a suitable size and overlap are found.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 correctly by returning immediately.
  - The function ensures that the sequence is generated for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The bit manipulation and recursive approach are sound and should handle the given constraints effectively. There are no apparent issues with the logic or the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
