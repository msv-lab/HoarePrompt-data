Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of generating an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to recursively construct this array by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` always returns `(0, 0)`, which is not used in the program. The base case should handle the situation when `number` is 0, and it should correctly terminate the recursion without returning a value that is not utilized.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `value`**: The calculation of `value` in the loop is incorrect. The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is not the correct way to determine the number of increasing subsequences that can be added. The correct formula for the number of increasing subsequences of length `k` is `2^k - 1`.

3. **Incorrect Range for `i` in the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1)` is not appropriate. The loop should iterate over possible values of `i` that can be used to construct the sequence, not over the current sequence itself.

4. **Incorrect Sequence Construction**: The sequence is constructed by appending integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, but this does not necessarily ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the sequence needs to be more carefully designed to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where it is impossible to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, if `X` is a prime number greater than 2, it might be impossible to construct such an array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
