Reasoning:

1. **Password Composition**: The program correctly processes the password by separating it into lists of digits and letters. This ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, as required by the problem description.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program checks this condition by iterating through the password and ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit. This is done using the following loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(password) - 1):
       if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
           return 'NO'
   ```
   This loop correctly identifies any violation of the rule where a letter is followed by a digit.

3. **Sorted Digits**: The program checks if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version:
   ```python
   if digits != sorted(digits):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   This ensures that the digits in the password are in the correct order.

4. **Sorted Letters**: Similarly, the program checks if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version:
   ```python
   if letters != sorted(letters):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   This ensures that the letters in the password are in the correct order.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases:
   - **Passwords with only letters**: If the password contains only letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the program will only check if the letters are sorted.
   - **Passwords with only digits**: If the password contains only digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the program will only check if the digits are sorted.
   - **Passwords with both letters and digits**: The program checks both the sorting of letters and digits, and the rule that no digit should follow a letter.
   - **Passwords of different lengths**: The program works for passwords of any length within the specified range (1 to 20 characters).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles all potential edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
