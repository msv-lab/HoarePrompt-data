Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the return value of `func_1` and processes each test case by calling `func_6` the specified number of times. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged number of test cases and the completion of the test case processing. **
