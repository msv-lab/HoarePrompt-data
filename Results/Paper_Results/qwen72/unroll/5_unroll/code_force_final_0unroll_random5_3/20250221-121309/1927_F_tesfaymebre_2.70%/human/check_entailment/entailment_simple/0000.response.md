### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using `func_3()` and stores them in a graph and a list of edges.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is appropriate for an undirected graph.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples, each containing the weight and the two vertices connected by the edge.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing of vertices.
   - The `min_edge` array is initialized to `float('inf')` to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each set.

4. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is a key step in the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If two vertices of an edge are already in the same set, it means a cycle is detected.
   - The program updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle Path**:
   - The program uses a DFS (Depth-First Search) to find the path of the cycle.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node during the DFS traversal.
   - The DFS function returns the path of the cycle if it finds a back edge to a node that has been visited but not fully processed.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting and Cycle Detection**:
  - The edges are sorted in descending order, which is incorrect for finding the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to ensure that the smallest edge is considered first.
  - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be `if parent_u != parent_v:` to detect cycles correctly. If `parent_u == parent_v`, it means the edge does not form a cycle and should be added to the union.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The DFS function is not correctly implemented to find the cycle path. It should return the cycle path when it detects a back edge to a node that has already been visited.
  - The `set_res` and `node_v` checks are not necessary and can be simplified.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has logical errors in the cycle detection and DFS implementation, which will lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
import threading

class DSU:

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.size = [1] * n
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, x):
        while self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.parent[self.parent[x]]
            x = self.parent[x]
        return x

    def union(self, a, b, w):
        parent_a = self.find(a)
        parent_b = self.find(b)
        self.min_edge[parent_a] = min(self.min_edge[parent_a], w)
        self.min_edge[parent_b] = min(self.min_edge[parent_b], w)
        if parent_a != parent_b:
            if self.size[parent_a] < self.size[parent_b]:
                (parent_a, parent_b) = (parent_b, parent_a)
            self.size[parent_a] += self.size[parent_b]
            self.min_edge[parent_a] = min(self.min_edge[parent_a], self.min_edge[parent_b])
            self.parent[parent_b] = parent_a
        return

def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    
    edges.sort()  # Sort edges in ascending order
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        if parent_u != parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        else:
            if w < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = w
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
    
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    cycle_path = []
    dfs(node_u, -1, cycle_path)
    print(_min_edge, len(cycle_path))
    print(*cycle_path)

def dfs(curr, parent, path):
    if colors[curr] == 1:
        return True  # Cycle detected
    colors[curr] = 1
    path.append(curr)
    for nei, w in graph[curr]:
        if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
            if dfs(nei, curr, path):
                return True
    colors[curr] = 2
    path.pop()
    return False

def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 30)
    threading.stack_size(1 << 27)
    main_thread = threading.Thread(target=func_7)
    main_thread.start()
    main_thread.join()
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are now sorted in ascending order by weight.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u != parent_v:` is used to detect cycles.
- **DFS Function**: The DFS function now correctly identifies the cycle path and returns it.

### Final Correctness:
- **False**: The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct output.
