### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are used to read the graph's vertices and edges, respectively.
   - These functions correctly handle the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - `func_6` constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` and a list of edges.
   - It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights, which is a crucial step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage connected components and track the minimum edge weight in each component.
   - The `find` and `union` methods are correctly implemented to handle path compression and union by size, which are essential for efficient component management.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function `func_6` iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - This approach ensures that the cycle with the minimum weight edge is found.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual vertices in the cycle.
   - It correctly marks vertices as visited and processed, and it returns the path of the cycle if it finds one.
   - The function ensures that the cycle is simple by not revisiting vertices and edges.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_6` prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

7. **Test Case Handling**:
   - `func_7` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the number of test cases and ensures that each test case is processed independently.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It reads the input, constructs the graph, uses the DSU to find the minimum weight edge in a cycle, and performs a DFS to find the cycle. The output is correctly formatted and meets the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
