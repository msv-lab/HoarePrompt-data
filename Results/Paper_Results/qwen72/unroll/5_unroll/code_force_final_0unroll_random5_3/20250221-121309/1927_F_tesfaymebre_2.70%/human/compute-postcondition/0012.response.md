Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list with the same structure as before, `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class with size `n + 1` and updated parent and rank structures, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union, `node_u` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight, `node_v` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight, `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0.**
