Functionality: ** The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns the current path in the DFS traversal if it encounters a vertex that has already been visited and is part of a cycle containing `node_v`. If no such cycle is found, the function returns an empty list. The function marks vertices as visited and processed during the traversal. **
