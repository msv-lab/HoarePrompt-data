Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it might need to be called in a loop where `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case provides a new `n` and a new list `a` with `n` integers, where `1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `0 <= a_i < n`.**
