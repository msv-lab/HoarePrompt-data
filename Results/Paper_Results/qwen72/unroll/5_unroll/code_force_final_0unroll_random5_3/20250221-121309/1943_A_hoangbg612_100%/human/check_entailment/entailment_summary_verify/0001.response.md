### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and Bob just removes the picked element from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game when both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M` to count the occurrence of `num`.
   - If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1, indicating that all numbers up to `cur` have been included in `c`.
   - It then collects all keys in `M` that have a count of 1 (i.e., unique numbers) into a list `cnt`.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique number in `cnt`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement do not correctly identify the MEX.
   - The final check `if len(cnt) >= 2` and setting `cur` to `cnt[1]` is not aligned with the optimal strategy for the game.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves understanding that Alice and Bob will play optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible unique number in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest possible unique number to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy is to consider the number of unique elements and their positions in the sorted array.

### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Code:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
  - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.

- **MEX Calculation Logic:**
  - The program uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.
  - It iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M`:
    - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
    - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, which is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy.
    - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
  - After the loop, if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1, which is also incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy.
  - It then collects all keys in `M` that have a count of 1 (i.e., unique numbers) into a list `cnt`.
  - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique number in `cnt`, which is not aligned with the optimal strategy.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The logic for determining the MEX and the conditions for updating `cur` and `M` are incorrect, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It fails to correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, and the MEX calculation logic is flawed.
