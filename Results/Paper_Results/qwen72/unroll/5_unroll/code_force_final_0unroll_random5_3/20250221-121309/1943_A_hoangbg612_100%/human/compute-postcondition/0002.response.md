Output State: **The loop will execute `T` times, and for each test case, it will read an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It will then sort `N` and process the list to determine the value of `cur`. The final value of `cur` will be printed for each test case. The variables `T`, `S`, and `N` will be consumed, and `cur` and `M` will be reset for each iteration. The list `cnt` will also be reset for each test case. After all iterations, the final state of `T` will be 0, and the values of `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` will be undefined as they are reset or consumed within each iteration.**
