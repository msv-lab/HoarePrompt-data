### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot pick the same element Alice just picked.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the optimal strategy.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - After processing the array, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the use of the dictionary `M` and the list `cnt` does not accurately reflect the MEX calculation.
   - The program incorrectly increments `cur` and breaks the loop in some cases, which does not align with the optimal strategy.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would involve Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from the sorted array `N`.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the next smallest element that is not yet in `c` but not the same as Alice's pick.
   - The MEX of `c` can be determined by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, and the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
