Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few logical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Tracking MEX Incorrectly**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to track the occurrences of numbers in the array `N`. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX, but the logic for updating `cur` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` is incorrect because it breaks the loop prematurely, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling the Final MEX**:
   - The program attempts to adjust the final MEX by checking if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. This is not a valid way to determine the MEX.
   - The final adjustment of `cur` based on the length of `cnt` is also incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after the game ends.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. Alice should always try to pick the smallest available number that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game by considering the optimal moves of both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Initialize the MEX value
        mex = 0
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                if mex in N:
                    N.remove(mex)
                    mex += 1
            else:  # Bob's turn
                if mex in N:
                    N.remove(mex)
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted to facilitate the optimal play.
- **MEX Calculation**: The variable `mex` is initialized to 0 and is incremented each time Alice picks the smallest available number that is not already in `c`.
- **Game Simulation**: The game is simulated by iterating through the array and removing elements based on the turn (Alice or Bob). Alice always tries to pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, while Bob tries to pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
- **Output**: The final MEX value is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is correctly calculated.
