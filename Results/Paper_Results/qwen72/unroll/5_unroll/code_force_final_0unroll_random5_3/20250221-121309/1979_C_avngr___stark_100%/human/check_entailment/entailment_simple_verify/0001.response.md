### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins on `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Let `x_i` be the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`.
   - We need `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

3. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - For each `i`, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]

4. **Finding a Solution:**
   - To satisfy the above condition for all `i`, we need to find `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than the return from the i-th bet.
   - One approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.

5. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - The program uses `func_2` to find the LCM of all `k_i`.

6. **Distributing the Bets:**
   - The program sets `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
   - This ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than the return from the i-th bet.

7. **Checking for No Solution:**
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If so, it prints `-1` indicating no solution.
   - If the sum of all bets is less than the LCM, it prints the bets.

8. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - The program then distributes the bets as `x_i = LCM // k_i`.
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM and prints the bets or `-1` accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and the main logic of the program are correct and align with the problem requirements. The program correctly calculates the LCM and distributes the bets in a way that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The program also handles the case where no valid solution exists by printing `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
