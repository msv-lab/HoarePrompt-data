### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation decreases `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any index `i` in the range `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - The function is correct and serves its purpose of verifying if the array is all zeros.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively.
   - If `list[i-1]` is not zero after the loop, it prints "no" and returns.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with `func_2`:**
   - **Incorrect Decrement Values:**
     - The operation should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.
     - The current implementation uses `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]`, which is incorrect.
   - **Restrictive Condition:**
     - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied even if `list[i]` is 1, as long as `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - **Premature Return:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is incorrect. The function should only return "NO" if it is impossible to make all elements zero, not just because one element is non-zero during the process.
   - **Inefficient and Incomplete Handling:**
     - The function does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros.
     - The function does not handle the case where the initial conditions make it impossible to perform the operation (e.g., if `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` are zero).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3.
   - This is because each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4, and for the array to be reduced to all zeros, the total sum must be a multiple of 4.
   - Additionally, the function should correctly apply the operation and handle all edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has several logical errors and does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem. The operation should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) and the conditions for applying the operation are not correctly handled. Additionally, the function should return a consistent result (either "YES" or "NO") rather than printing "no" and returning.

Final: **False**
