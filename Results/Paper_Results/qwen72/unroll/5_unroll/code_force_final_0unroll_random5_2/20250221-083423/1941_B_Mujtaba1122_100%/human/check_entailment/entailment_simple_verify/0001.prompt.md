You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` will return `True` if the current state of the list and the value of `n` satisfy the condition within `func_1`, otherwise it will return `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation that decreases `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any index `i` in the range `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose of verifying if the array is all zeros.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively.
   - If `list[i-1]` is not zero after the loop, it prints "no" and returns.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with `func_2`:**
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively. This is incorrect because the operation should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied even if `list[i]` is 1, as long as `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The function prints "no" and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is incorrect. The function should only return "NO" if it is impossible to make all elements zero, not just because one element is non-zero during the process.
   - The function does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros or where the initial conditions make it impossible to perform the operation (e.g., if `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` are zero).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3 and if the array can be reduced to zero using the operations.
   - The operation can be applied as long as the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are greater than or equal to 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - If the sum of the array is not divisible by 3, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has several logical errors and does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem. The operation should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) and the conditions for applying the operation are not correctly handled. Additionally, the function should return a consistent result (either "YES" or "NO") rather than printing "no" and returning.
