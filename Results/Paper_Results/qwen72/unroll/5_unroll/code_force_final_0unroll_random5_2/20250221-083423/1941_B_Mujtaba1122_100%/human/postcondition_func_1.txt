The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that all elements from index 0 to n-2 are set to zero. The function returns `None` but prints 'no' and exits early if any element from index 0 to n-2 is not zero after the modification process. If the modification process completes and all elements from index 0 to n-2 are zero, the function calls `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
