The provided initial state and the code snippet suggest that the list has been modified according to a specific pattern, and the function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True` for the current state of the list and the value of `n`. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on the list or the function `func_1`; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - The list has zeros at all positions from 0 to n-2.
   - Elements at positions 1 to n-2 are reduced by twice the original value of their preceding element.
   - Elements at positions 2 to n-1 are reduced by the original value of their preceding element.
   - The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` for the current state of the list and the value of `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any variables or objects from the initial state.
   - It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
