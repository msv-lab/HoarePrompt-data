The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, and the `range` function. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3.

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list), we do not need to adjust `n`. However, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list), `i` is 1**
