### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The program uses `list[i - 1]` to determine the number of times to apply the operation. This approach is incorrect because it can lead to reducing `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` to negative values, which is not allowed.
   - For example, consider the input `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The program will attempt to reduce `list[1]` by `2 * list[0]`, which is `2 * 1 = 2`. This will reduce `list[1]` to `1` and `list[2]` to `4`. However, the program will then attempt to reduce `list[2]` by `2 * list[1]`, which is `2 * 1 = 2`. This will reduce `list[2]` to `2` and `list[3]` to `3`. The program will then attempt to reduce `list[3]` by `2 * list[2]`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`. This will reduce `list[3]` to `-1`, which is not allowed.

2. **No Check for Negative Values**:
   - The program does not check if any element becomes negative after applying the operation. This is a critical flaw because the problem description explicitly states that elements must remain non-negative.
   - For example, in the input `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the program will reduce `list[3]` to `-1`, which is not a valid state.

3. **Inefficient Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is not efficient and does not guarantee that the operation will be applied in a way that all elements become zero.
   - The program attempts to reduce elements in a sequential manner, which is not always the correct approach. The correct approach involves ensuring that the sum of the elements is divisible by 4 and that the elements can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
n = 5
list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]
```
The program will output "NO" for this input, but it should output "YES" because it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations as shown in the problem description.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Ensure that the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4.
2. Ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative.
3. Use a more efficient and correct approach to apply the operations.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases and can lead to incorrect results due to the issues mentioned.

Final: **False**
