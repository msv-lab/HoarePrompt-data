Based on the initial state provided:

- The list has zeros at all positions from 0 to n-2.
- The elements at positions 1 to n-2 are reduced by twice the original value of their preceding element.
- The elements at positions 2 to n-1 are reduced by the original value of their preceding element.
- The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'NO'`. The initial state does not affect the value of this string literal, as it is a constant value.

Output: **NO**
