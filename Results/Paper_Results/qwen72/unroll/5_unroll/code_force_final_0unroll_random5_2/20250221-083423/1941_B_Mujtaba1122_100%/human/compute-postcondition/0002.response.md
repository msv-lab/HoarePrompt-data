Postcondition: **The list will have zeros at all positions from 0 to n-2, and the elements at positions 1 to n-2 will be reduced by twice the original value of their preceding element, while the elements at positions 2 to n-1 will be reduced by the original value of their preceding element. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` for the current state of the list and the value of `n`.**
