### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation decreases `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any index `i` in the range `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose of verifying if the array is all zeros.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - The function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively.
   - If `list[i-1]` is not zero after the loop, it prints "no" and returns.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with `func_2`:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Decrement:**
     - The operation should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.
   - **Restrictive Condition:**
     - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied even if `list[i]` is 1, as long as `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - **Early Return:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is incorrect. The function should only return "NO" if it is impossible to make all elements zero, not just because one element is non-zero during the process.
   - **Sum Divisibility:**
     - The function does not check if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3, which is a necessary condition for the array to be reducible to all zeros.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The function does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros or where the initial conditions make it impossible to perform the operation (e.g., if `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` are zero).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3.
   - If the sum is divisible by 3, it is possible to make all elements zero using the operations.
   - If the sum is not divisible by 3, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The provided program has several logical errors and does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem. The operation should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) and the conditions for applying the operation are not correctly handled. Additionally, the function should return a consistent result (either "YES" or "NO") rather than printing "no" and returning. The sum of the elements in the array should be checked for divisibility by 3 to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
