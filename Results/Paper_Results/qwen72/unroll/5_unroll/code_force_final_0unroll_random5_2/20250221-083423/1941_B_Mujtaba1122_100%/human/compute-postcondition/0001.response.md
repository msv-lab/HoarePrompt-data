To determine the output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the given loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n - 1)`):**
   - This loop iterates over the indices of the list from 1 to n-2 (inclusive).

2. **Inner Loop (`while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`):**
   - This loop continues as long as the current element (`list[i]`), the previous element (`list[i - 1]`), and the next element (`list[i + 1]`) are all greater than 0 and `list[i]` is greater than 1.
   - Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases the next element by the value of the previous element.
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases the current element by twice the value of the previous element.
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases the previous element by its own value, effectively setting it to 0.

3. **Condition (`if list[i - 1] != 0`):**
   - After the inner loop, if the previous element (`list[i - 1]`) is not 0, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
- For each `i` from 1 to n-2:
  - The inner loop will continue to execute as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.
  - Each iteration of the inner loop will:
    - Set `list[i - 1]` to 0.
    - Decrease `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i - 1]` (which was its original value).
    - Decrease `list[i + 1]` by the value of `list[i - 1]` (which was its original value).
  - Once `list[i - 1]` is set to 0, the inner loop will terminate.
  - The condition `if list[i - 1] != 0` will not be met because `list[i - 1]` is now 0, so the function will not print 'no' or return.

### Final State:
- After the loop has executed, the list will be modified such that:
  - For each `i` from 1 to n-2, `list[i - 1]` will be 0.
  - `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the original value of `list[i - 1]`.
  - `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by the original value of `list[i - 1]`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The list will have zeros at all positions from 0 to n-2 (inclusive).
- The elements at positions 1 to n-2 will be reduced by twice the original value of their preceding element.
- The elements at positions 2 to n-1 will be reduced by the original value of their preceding element.

### Output State:
Output State: **The list will have zeros at all positions from 0 to n-2, and the elements at positions 1 to n-2 will be reduced by twice the original value of their preceding element, while the elements at positions 2 to n-1 will be reduced by the original value of their preceding element.**
