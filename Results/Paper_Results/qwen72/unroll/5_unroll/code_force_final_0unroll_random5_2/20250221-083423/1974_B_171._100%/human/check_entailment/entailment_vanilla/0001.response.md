### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string and appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters in the string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
  - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is essential for creating the symmetric mapping.
  
- **Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The program creates a symmetric mapping by pairing the first character with the last, the second with the second last, and so on. This is done using a dictionary `char_map`.
  
- **Decoding:**
  - The program decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the encoded string has all unique characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings.

### Correctness:
**True**
