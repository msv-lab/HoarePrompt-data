The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in a dictionary `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to its reverse position in the sorted list of unique characters.
