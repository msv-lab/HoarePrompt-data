Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Splitting the String**: The program splits the string `s` by the character `-`. This step is not necessary for solving the problem as described. The splitting is intended to isolate segments of `+` characters, but it does not contribute to the correct calculation of the penalty. The variable `result_length` is computed but not used in the function `func_1`, which indicates that this part of the code is redundant.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `expression`.
   - For each `+` character, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - For each `-` character, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

   The logic in `func_1` is intended to count the number of times the balance goes below 0 and to add 1 if the final balance is positive. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

4. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The `balance` variable is used to track the cumulative sum of the array, but the logic for splitting and calculating the penalty is incorrect.
   - The program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. It only counts the number of times the `balance` becomes negative and adds 1 if the final `balance` is positive.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of 0 if possible. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is 0.
   - If it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of 0, the next best strategy is to split the array into subarrays with the smallest possible non-zero sum.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the correct output is 1, which the program produces.
   - For the input `-----`, the correct output is 5, which the program produces.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the correct output is 0, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the correct output is 4, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the correct output is 4, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

Final: **False**
