Reasoning:  
The program is designed to check if a given password meets the criteria for being strong, as described in the problem statement. The criteria are:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program reads input from `stdin`, processes each test case, and appends the result of the password check to a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. The function `func_1` is responsible for checking the password against the criteria.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the number of test cases `t` and the length of each password `n`.

2. **Password Check:**
   - **Condition 1:** The program implicitly checks this condition by only appending characters to the `digits` and `letters` lists if they are digits or letters, respectively. This ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - **Condition 2:** The program checks if there is a digit followed by a letter by maintaining a `last_digit_index`. If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Condition 3:** The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
   - **Condition 4:** The program checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Password: "12ac"
  - Digits: "12"
  - Letters: "ac"
  - All conditions are met: Digits are sorted, letters are sorted, and no digit follows a letter.
  - Output: "YES"

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Password: "123wa"
  - Digits: "123"
  - Letters: "wa"
  - Condition 2 is violated: 'w' follows '3'.
  - Output: "NO"

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Password: "allllmost"
  - Digits: ""
  - Letters: "allllmost"
  - All conditions are met: No digits, letters are sorted.
  - Output: "YES"

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Password: "ac123"
  - Digits: "123"
  - Letters: "ac"
  - Condition 2 is violated: '1' follows 'c'.
  - Output: "NO"

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Password: "011679"
  - Digits: "011679"
  - Letters: ""
  - All conditions are met: No letters, digits are sorted.
  - Output: "YES"

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check the password strength based on the given criteria. It handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
