t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: n (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x (an integer such that 1 <= x <= n), and p (a list of integers of length n, where each element is a unique integer from 1 to n). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
