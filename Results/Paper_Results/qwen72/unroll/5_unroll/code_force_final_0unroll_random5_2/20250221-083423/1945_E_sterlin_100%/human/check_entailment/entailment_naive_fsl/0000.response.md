Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are just placeholders for reading input, but they do not perform the binary search or the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. The program is incomplete and does not follow the problem description for any potential case. For example, the program does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem description, and it does not perform the binary search algorithm or the swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
