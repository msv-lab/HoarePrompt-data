Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each a_i represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick (2^{a_i}). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is the number of test cases provided as an input integer. `buffer` is an empty list.**
