### Reasoning

Let's break down the original assessment and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function Summary
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from input.
- It calculates the probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of children from the total possible pairs.
- It initializes `a` to the sum of initial friendship values `f_i` for all friend pairs.
- It iterates `k` times to update the sum `s` of the expected friendship values.
- The update logic in the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- Finally, it prints the result `s % M`.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because the logic for updating the sum `s` in the loop is flawed. Specifically, the update `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach should be:
1. Calculate the probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of children.
2. Initialize the sum of friendship values `a` for all friend pairs.
3. For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is `c * a` (the current sum of friendship values) plus `c * m` (the probability of choosing a friend pair and increasing its value by 1).
4. Update the sum of friendship values `a` for the next excursion by adding `c * m` to `a`.

### Analysis of the Given Program
- **Probability Calculation**: The probability `c` is correctly calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The sum `a` of initial friendship values is correctly calculated.
- **Update Logic**: The update logic `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` is not part of the expected value calculation. The correct update should be `s = s + c * (a + m)`.

### Corrected Program
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + m)) % M
            a = (a + c * m) % M
        print(s % M)
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: `a` is initialized to the sum of initial friendship values.
- **Loop**: For each excursion, the expected value of the sum of friendship values is updated by adding `c * (a + m)`.
- **Update `a`**: After each excursion, the sum of friendship values `a` is updated by adding `c * m` to account for the expected increase in friendship values.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The update logic in the loop is flawed, and the corrected program should be used instead.

Final: **False**
