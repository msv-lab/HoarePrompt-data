### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Modulo and Inverse Calculation**:
   - The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct for the problem's constraints.
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is correct for finding the modular inverse.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to store the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i`.
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and is used to store the final sum of friendship values.
   - The function iterates `k` times to simulate each excursion. In each iteration, it updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the initial friendship values of the pairs of friends.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final value of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions. The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion is `c * a`, not `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is:
  \[
  \text{expected\_value} = k \cdot \left( \frac{a}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{i}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \cdot m
  \]
  - The first term `k * (a / \binom{n}{2})` represents the expected contribution of the initial friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The second term \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{i}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \cdot m\) represents the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        # Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values
        expected_value = (k * a * c) % M
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            expected_value = (expected_value + i * c * m) % M
        
        print(expected_value)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation inside the loop.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
