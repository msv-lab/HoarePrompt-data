You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: n (number of children), m (number of pairs of friends), and k (number of excursions). Additionally, it should take a list of m tuples, each containing three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4 (number of test cases), 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `s` will contain the final computed value of the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` will retain their initial values, and the variable `a` will be the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendship_pairs`. It returns an error message if the input values do not meet the specified constraints. If the input values are valid, it returns a list of integers representing the maximum possible sum of friendship values for each of the `k` excursions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
