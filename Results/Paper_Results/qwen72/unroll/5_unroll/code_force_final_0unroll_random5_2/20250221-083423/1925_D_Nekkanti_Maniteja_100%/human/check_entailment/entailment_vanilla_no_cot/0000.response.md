Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a flaw in how it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program incorrectly accumulates the expected value by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion, which does not correctly reflect the expected increase in friendship values.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `a` is the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - `s` is the sum of expected friendship values over all excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected number of new friendships formed.
   - The expected number of new friendships formed in each excursion is `m * c`, because each pair of friends has a probability of `c` of being chosen.
   - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is `a + m * c`.

3. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The correct way to calculate the expected value is to sum the expected increase for each of the `k` excursions.
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions is `k * (a + m * c)`.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The result should be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = a + m * c
        s = k * expected_increase
        print(s % M)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions.
