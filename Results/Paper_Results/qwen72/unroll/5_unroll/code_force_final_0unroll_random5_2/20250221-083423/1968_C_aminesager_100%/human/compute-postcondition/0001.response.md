The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is inherently non-zero and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n**
