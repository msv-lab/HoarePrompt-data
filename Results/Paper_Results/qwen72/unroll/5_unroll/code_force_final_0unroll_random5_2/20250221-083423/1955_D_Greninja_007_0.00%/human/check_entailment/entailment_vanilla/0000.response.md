### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in array `b` and the initial window of size `m` in array `a`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the frequency in either array.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the first window to the last possible window of size `m`.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k` and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if true.
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window and the element that is sliding into the window.
     - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly:
       - Decreases the `matches` count if the element sliding out was in `b`.
       - Increases the `matches` count if the element sliding in is in `b`.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if true.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the frequency counts and the initial matches.
- The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly updates the frequency and matches count.
- The final check ensures that the last window is also considered.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
