You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers, a list `b` of integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer present in both the subarray and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `b`. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the only output is the integer `good_subarrays` representing the number of such subarrays.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments in the array `a` based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` of length `m`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**:
   - It calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and `b` by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`.
   - For each new position of the window, it updates the count of matches by adjusting the frequency counts and the matches count accordingly.
   - It checks if the current window has at least `k` matches and increments the `good_subarrays` count if it does.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks the last window to ensure it is counted if it has at least `k` matches.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- It correctly initializes and updates the frequency counts.
- It correctly calculates the number of matches for each window.
- It correctly handles the case where the window reaches the end of the array.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
