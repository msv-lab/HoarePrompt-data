You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers, n and k, as input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and return a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and exactly k of the n cyclic shifts of the list are sorted. If no such list exists, the function should return -1.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers n and k, and then prints a list of n integers based on the conditions: if k is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of n integers all equal to k if n equals k, otherwise it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n. The loop continues until all lines are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each line, it prints a list of `n` integers based on the following conditions: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of `n` integers all equal to `k` if `n` equals `k`, otherwise it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all lines, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input (stdin).
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `k >= 2`.
   - If `k >= 2`, it further checks if `n == k`.
     - If `n == k`, it prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`), it prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `k == 1`, the program prints the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
     - This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is itself.
     - Therefore, this case is correct.

   - **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**
     - If `n == k`, the program prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
     - This array is sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted because all elements are the same.
     - Therefore, this case is correct.

   - **Case 3: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**
     - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for `k >= 2` and `n != k`. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 1, 2, 2]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 1, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` correctly. It incorrectly prints `-1` for such cases, even though valid arrays can exist.

### Correctness:
**False**
