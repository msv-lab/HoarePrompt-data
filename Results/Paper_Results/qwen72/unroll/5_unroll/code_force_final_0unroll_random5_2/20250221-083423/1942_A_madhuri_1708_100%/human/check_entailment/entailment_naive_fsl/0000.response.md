Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for certain values of `n` and `k` where a valid solution exists.

### Case Analysis:
1. **When `k == 1`**:
   - The program correctly generates a sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

2. **When `k == n`**:
   - The program correctly generates an array where all elements are the same, which ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.

3. **When `2 <= k < n`**:
   - The program incorrectly prints `-1` for all such cases. However, there are valid arrays that can satisfy these conditions. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`. This array has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1, 2]` and `[2, 1, 2, 1]`.

### Example of Failure:
- **Input**: `4 2`
- **Expected Output**: `1 2 1 2` (or any other valid array with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts)
- **Actual Output**: `-1`

Since the program fails to generate a valid array for the case where `2 <= k < n`, it is considered incorrect.
