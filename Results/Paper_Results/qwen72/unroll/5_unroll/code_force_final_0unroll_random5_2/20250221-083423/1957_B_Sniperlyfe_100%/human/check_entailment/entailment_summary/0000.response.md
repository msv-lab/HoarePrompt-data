Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - The value of `k` is then reduced by `nums[0]`.
   - For the remaining elements, the program iterates from `1` to `n-1`:
     - If `k` is greater than `0`, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`. This ensures that each subsequent number is as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
     - It then reduces `k` by `nums[i]`.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the constructed sequence to a list `results` and prints all sequences at the end.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k` by distributing `k` among the elements and adding any remaining value to `nums[0]`. This condition is satisfied.
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**:
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the first element.
  - The remaining elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, which ensures that they contribute to the bitwise OR without exceeding `k`. This helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the final bitwise OR.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element (n = 1)**: The program correctly outputs `k` as the only element.
- **Multiple Elements (n > 1)**: The program distributes `k` among the elements, ensuring that the sum condition is met and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct the sequence for the given problem constraints and test cases. It ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Correctness: **True**
