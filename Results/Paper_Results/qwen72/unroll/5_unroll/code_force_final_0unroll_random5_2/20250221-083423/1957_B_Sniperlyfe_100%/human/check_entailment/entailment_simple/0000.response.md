### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the output for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - The first element of `nums` is set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to `1` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The value of `k` is then decreased by the value of the first element.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns each element the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the first element to account for any remaining value of `k` (if `k` is not exactly zero after the loop).

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the elements in `nums` is correctly calculated to be `k` by the end of the function.
  - The first element is set to a large value to maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation, and the remaining elements are adjusted to ensure the sum is `k`.

- **Bitwise OR Condition:**
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to `1` up to the highest bit set in `k`.
  - The remaining elements are set to values that are as large as possible without exceeding `k`, but they are constrained to be at most `nums[0] + 1`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` will have the maximum number of `1`s in its binary representation.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `k` as the only element.
  - For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR is maximized by distributing the remaining `k` among the elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly satisfies both conditions of the problem for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
