#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) of length `n`. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The function processes all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr` of length `m`. It prints 'YES' if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of test cases `t` is not explicitly managed within the function, and the function does not return any value. The internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each iteration of the outer loop, which runs `n` times. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
