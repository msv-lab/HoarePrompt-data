You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) of length `n`. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The function processes all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr` of length `m`. It prints 'YES' if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of test cases `t` is not explicitly managed within the function, and the function does not return any value. The internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each iteration of the outer loop, which runs `n` times. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element in the array that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the first line contains the length of the array, and the second line contains the elements of the array.
   - The output should be "YES" if the array can be sorted using the operation, and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, which will be used to determine if the array can be sorted.
   - The program then iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (using `range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - For each element, if it is greater than the previous element, it splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to this list.
   - It checks if the resulting list of digits and the current element is sorted.
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program's logic for checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` checks if the current element is less than the previous element, which is correct.
   - However, the way it handles the splitting of the previous element and the subsequent check is incorrect. The program splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to this list, but it should instead split the current element and check if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the current element itself is split and the resulting digits are inserted back into the array.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
     - Iterate over the array and check if any element can be split to help sort the array.
     - If an element is split, the resulting digits should be inserted back into the array and the array should be checked for sortedness.
     - This process should be repeated until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should correctly determine that the array can be sorted by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
   - For the input `[12, 28, 5]`, the program should correctly determine that the array cannot be sorted because splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` does not help in sorting the array.
   - For the input `[0, 0]`, the program should correctly determine that the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the splitting of elements and the subsequent checks for sortedness. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****
