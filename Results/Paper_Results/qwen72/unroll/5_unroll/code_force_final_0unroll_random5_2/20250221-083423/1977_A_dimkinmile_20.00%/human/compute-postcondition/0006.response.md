The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` within the specified range and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100 and returns a result based on these inputs.**
