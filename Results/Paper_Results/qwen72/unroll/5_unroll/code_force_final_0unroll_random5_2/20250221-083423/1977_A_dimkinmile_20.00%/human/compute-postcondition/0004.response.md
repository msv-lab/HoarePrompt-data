The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes that `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, where `1 <= n, m <= 100`, and `n` is less than `m`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` in any way. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
