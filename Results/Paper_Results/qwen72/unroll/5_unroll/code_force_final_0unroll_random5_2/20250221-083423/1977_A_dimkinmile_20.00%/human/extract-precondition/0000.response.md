Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func_1(n, m):
```

This ensures that the function can correctly process the inputs as described in the problem.
