The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns a list of results for each test case. The result for each test case is based on the values of a, b, and c, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints.
