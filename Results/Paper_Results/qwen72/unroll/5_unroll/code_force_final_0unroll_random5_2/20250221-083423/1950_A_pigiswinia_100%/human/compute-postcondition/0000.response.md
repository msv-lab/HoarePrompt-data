The value of `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` should be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
