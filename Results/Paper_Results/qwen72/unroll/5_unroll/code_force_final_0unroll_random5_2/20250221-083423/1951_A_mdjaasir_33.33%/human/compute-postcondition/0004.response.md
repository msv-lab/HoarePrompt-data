Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, and for each of the `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a`. It then checks the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's, it prints 'YES'; if there are more than 2 '1's and the count is even, it prints 'YES'; if there are exactly 2 '1's and they are not consecutive, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After `t` iterations, the function completes and the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to the `start` and `end` variables and the subfolders in the current directory. **
