You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and composed of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. If such a template exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variable `tests` retains its initial value, and the variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' print statement, otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `counter` will be equal to the length of the last processed string `c`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks if a template can be constructed such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The issue lies in the following part of the code:

```python
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1
```

This loop checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If it finds such a character, it immediately prints 'YES' and breaks the loop. However, this is incorrect because:

1. **Character Matching Logic**: The program should check if there exists a template where each character in `a` and `b` matches the template conditions, and each character in `c` does not match the template conditions. The current logic only checks if a character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

2. **Template Construction**: The program does not construct the template and verify it for all positions. It only checks a single position and immediately concludes the result, which can lead to incorrect answers.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:

```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

For this input, the program will output 'NO' because it will check each character in `c` and find that each character is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, but it will not correctly determine if a valid template exists. 

A valid template for this case would be "ABC", where:
- 'A' (uppercase) does not match 'a' or 'b' but does not match 'g'.
- 'B' (uppercase) does not match 'b' or 'e' but does not match 'h'.
- 'C' (uppercase) does not match 'c' or 'f' but does not match 'i'.

Thus, the strings `a` and `b` match the template "ABC", while `c` does not. The correct output should be 'YES', but the program outputs 'NO'.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Constructing a potential template based on the conditions given.
2. Verifying that both `a` and `b` match this template.
3. Verifying that `c` does not match this template.

The provided program does not follow this approach and hence is incorrect.
