#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function should determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match it, while string c does not.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `tests` remains unchanged as it was the input integer. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' print statement, otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `counter` will be equal to the length of the last processed string `c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and composed of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. If such a template exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variable `tests` retains its initial value, and the variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' print statement, otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `counter` will be equal to the length of the last processed string `c`.
