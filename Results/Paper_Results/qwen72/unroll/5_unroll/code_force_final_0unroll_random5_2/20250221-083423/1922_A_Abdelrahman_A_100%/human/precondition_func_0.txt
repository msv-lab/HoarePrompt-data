The function takes no parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function should determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match it, while string c does not.
