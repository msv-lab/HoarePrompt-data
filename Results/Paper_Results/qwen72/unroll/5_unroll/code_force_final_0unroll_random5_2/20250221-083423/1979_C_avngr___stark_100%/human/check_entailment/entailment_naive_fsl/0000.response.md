Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem requires a function to determine how to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit for any winning outcome. However, the provided program only contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. These functions do not address the core requirement of the problem, which is to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be a list of bets like `27 41 12` as described in the problem statement. However, the provided program does not produce any such output. Instead, it would compute the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
