### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The condition can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the i-th outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values to find a suitable distribution of bets.
   - The LCM is calculated using `func_2`, which iteratively applies `func_1` to the list of `k_i` values.
   - The bets `x_i` are set to `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM of all `k_i` values.
   - The program then checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` by dividing their product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The program calculates the LCM of all `k_i` values and sets `x_i` to `m // k_i`.
   - The sum of all bets is then checked against the LCM. If the sum is less than the LCM, the bets are valid; otherwise, the program outputs `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the sum of all bets will be equal to the total amount received back, which does not satisfy the condition. Hence, the output should be `-1` in such cases.
   - The program correctly handles this edge case by checking if `sum(c) >= m`.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Functions**:
  - `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to calculate the LCM of the given `k_i` values.

- **Correctness of Bets**:
  - The bets `x_i` are set to `m // k_i`, which ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`.
  - The program correctly checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM and outputs `-1` if it is not.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where all `k_i` values are the same by outputting `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the LCM of the `k_i` values, sets the bets accordingly, and checks the condition to ensure the bets are valid. The edge cases are also correctly handled.

Final: **True**
