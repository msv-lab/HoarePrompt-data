#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since both `a` and `b` are positive integers, the absolute value of their product is simply their product. The GCD of `a` and `b` is a positive integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. The returned value is the integer result of `a * b` divided by `gcd(a, b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The returned value is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is equal to the final value produced by applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value produced by applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of sequentially applying the function `func_1` to all elements of the list. After the function concludes, the input list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the final result of the computation.
