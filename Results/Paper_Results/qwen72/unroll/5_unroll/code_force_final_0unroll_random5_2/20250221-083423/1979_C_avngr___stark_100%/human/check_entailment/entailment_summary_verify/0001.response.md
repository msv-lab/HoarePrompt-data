### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` to hold for all `i`, we need to find a set of `x_i` values such that:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the i-th outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The original assessment suggests setting `x_i` proportional to the product of all `k_j` values except `k_i`. This is a valid approach, but it can be simplified.
   - Another valid approach is to set `x_i` to a value that ensures the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`. One such value is `1` for all `k_i` except the smallest `k_i`, which can be set to a value that ensures the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all `k_i` values.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The original assessment suggests calculating the LCM of all `k_i` values and setting `x_i` to the LCM divided by `k_i`.
   - However, this approach is not necessary. A simpler approach is to set `x_i` to `1` for all `k_i` except the smallest `k_i`, which can be set to a value that ensures the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the sum of all bets will be equal to the total amount received back, which does not satisfy the condition. Hence, the output should be `-1` in such cases.
   - The original assessment correctly handles this edge case.

### Correctness:
- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the given `k_i` values.
- The approach of setting `x_i` to the LCM divided by `k_i` ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`, satisfying the problem's condition.
- The edge case where all `k_i` values are the same is correctly handled by returning `-1`.

However, the original assessment does not provide the actual implementation of the main logic to distribute the coins. The provided functions only calculate the LCM, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the entire program. The main logic for distributing the coins is missing, and without it, we cannot fully evaluate the program's correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and edge case handling, but it lacks the implementation of the main logic.
- Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say the program is correct or incorrect.

Final: **False** (due to incomplete implementation)
