You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The `final` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the sum of the sorted even-indexed integers from the corresponding input list. The variable `num` will be equal to `int(n) - 1`. The variables `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be reset to their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: The `final` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the sum of the sorted even-indexed integers from the corresponding input list. The variable `num` will be equal to `int(n) - 1`. The variables `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be reset to their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed each element of the `final` list, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). It then appends this sum to a list `final`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `final`, one per line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integers together. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest integers are paired first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values in each pair.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score `s`.
   - This approach is correct because the sum of the minimum values of each pair will always be maximized when the list is sorted.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the final score for each test case to a list `final`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores one by one.

### Potential Issues:
- **Type Conversion**:
  - The program converts the input `n` and `a` to integers, which is correct.
  - It splits the input `b` into a list of strings and then converts each string to an integer, which is also correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all integers are the same correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It reads the input correctly, sorts the list, and sums the minimum values of each pair to achieve the maximum score. The output is also handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
