### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and then reads the list of 2n integers.
   - The integers are split and converted to a list of integers, which is then sorted.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the score by summing the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the sorted list.
   - This approach is based on the observation that, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the even indices when pairs are selected in order. This ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints the final scores for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies that to maximize the score, you should always choose the smallest available number from the sorted list. This is because the minimum of each pair will be the smaller number, and by always selecting the smallest number first, you ensure that the sum of these minimum values is maximized.
  - The function correctly sorts the list and sums the elements at even indices, which are the smallest elements in each pair.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and where all numbers are the same. In both cases, the algorithm correctly sums the smallest elements.

- **Input and Output Handling:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - The output is correctly formatted, with one score per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the maximum score for each test case by summing the smallest elements of each pair in the sorted list.

### Correctness:
**True**
