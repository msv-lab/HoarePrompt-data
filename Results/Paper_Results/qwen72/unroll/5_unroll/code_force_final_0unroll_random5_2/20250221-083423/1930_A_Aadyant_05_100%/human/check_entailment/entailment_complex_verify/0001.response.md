### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - However, it reads the integer `n` for each test case, which is unnecessary. The problem description states that `n` is the number of pairs, and the list of `2n` integers is provided in the next line. The program should directly read the list of `2n` integers without reading `n` separately.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integers together. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest integers are paired first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values in each pair.
   - The sorting is done correctly, and it ensures that the minimum values are at even indices in the sorted list.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score `s`.
   - This approach is correct because the sum of the minimum values of each pair will always be maximized when the list is sorted.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the final score for each test case to a list `final`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores one by one.
   - The output is handled correctly.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Input**:
  - The program reads `n` for each test case, which is unnecessary. The value of `n` can be derived from the length of the list of integers.
  - This does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is an unnecessary step that could be optimized.

- **Type Conversion**:
  - The program converts the input `n` and `a` to integers, which is correct.
  - It splits the input `b` into a list of strings and then converts each string to an integer, which is also correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all integers are the same correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It reads the input correctly (except for the redundant reading of `n`), sorts the list, and sums the minimum values of each pair to achieve the maximum score. The output is also handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct in its logic and output, even though it includes an unnecessary step of reading `n` for each test case. This redundancy does not affect the correctness of the solution.
