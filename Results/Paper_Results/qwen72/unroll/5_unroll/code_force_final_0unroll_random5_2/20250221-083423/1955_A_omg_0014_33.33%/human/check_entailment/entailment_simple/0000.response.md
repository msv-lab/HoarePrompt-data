Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` which should represent the number of test cases. However, the variable name `n` is misleading here because it is used later in the loop to represent the number of yogurts. A better variable name would be `t` for the number of test cases.

2. **Variable Assignment**: Inside the loop, the function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. According to the problem description, these should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The current assignment is incorrect and should be fixed.

3. **Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. This is intended to represent the price of one yogurt if bought at the promotion price. However, `c` should be `b`, and the calculation should be `b / 2`.

4. **Condition and Output**: The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It should be checking if the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price is less than the cost of buying them at the promotion price. The correct condition should be `if n * a < (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

5. **Output Calculation**: The output should be the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. The correct calculation should be:
   - `(n // 2) * b` for the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
   - `(n % 2) * a` for the cost of buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price.

6. **Rounding Issue**: The use of `round(a * d)` is unnecessary and incorrect. The cost should be an integer, and the correct calculation should not involve rounding.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
