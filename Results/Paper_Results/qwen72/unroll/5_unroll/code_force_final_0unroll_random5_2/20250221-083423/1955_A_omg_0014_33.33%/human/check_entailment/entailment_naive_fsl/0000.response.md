Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. It should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then for each test case, it should read `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the program reads `n` and then tries to read `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, which is not what the problem description specifies.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program uses variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in a way that does not match the problem description. The variable `c` should represent the price for two yogurts, but the program uses `c` and `d` in a way that does not make sense for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not correctly determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The correct approach should be to compare the cost of buying yogurts individually with the cost of buying them in pairs and then adjust for any remaining yogurts.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts in pairs
        cost_pairs = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
