### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Selection**:
   - The program sorts the list of `2n` integers.
   - It then selects the first `n` integers from the sorted list. This is based on the observation that to maximize the score, you should always choose the smallest possible values for `min(x, y)` in each move. By sorting the list and selecting the first `n` elements, you ensure that you are always picking the smallest values, which is optimal.

3. **Summing and Appending**:
   - The program sums the selected `n` integers and appends the result to the list `out`.
   - This list `out` is used to store the results for all test cases.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each element in the list `out`, which contains the maximum scores for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by selecting the minimum of the two integers.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` by selecting the smallest `n` integers from the sorted list.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program's approach is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 5000 test cases and up to 100 integers per test case).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always selecting the smallest possible values for `min(x, y)` in each move, which is the optimal strategy. The input and output handling are also correct, and the program produces the expected results for the given examples.
