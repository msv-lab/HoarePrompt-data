You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of inputs and processes them to output the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from each input list. Specifically, it first reads an integer `num` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a space-separated string of `2n` integers. It then sorts these integers, selects the first `n` of them, sums them, and appends the result to a list `out`. Finally, it prints each element in `out`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `out` to contain the sums for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the variable `out` as a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`, from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `out` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs (i.e., `n`).
   - It then reads a line of input containing `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers.
   - It initializes an empty list `list2` to store the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iterates `a` times (i.e., `n` times) and for each iteration, it appends the `2i`-th element of the sorted list `list1` to `list2`. This is because the `2i`-th element (0-based index) will always be the smaller of the two elements in the pair after sorting.
   - After collecting all the minimum values, it calculates the sum of `list2` and appends this sum to the `out` list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `out` list.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The strategy of sorting the list and then taking the smaller element of each pair is indeed optimal. This ensures that the smallest numbers are used in the score calculation, which maximizes the score.
- **Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.
  - It correctly outputs the results for each test case.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (i.e., only one pair of numbers).
  - It also handles the case where all numbers are the same, as seen in the third test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
