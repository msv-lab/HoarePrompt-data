### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square. These coordinates are stored in a list of lists `a`.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates:**
   - The program extracts the X-coordinates from the list of points `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum X-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum X-coordinates will be the same as the difference between the maximum and minimum Y-coordinates. This is because the square's side length is the same in both dimensions.

4. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

5. **Assumptions:**
   - The problem guarantees that the input points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
   - Therefore, the program's logic of using the difference in X-coordinates to determine the side length is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case based on the given problem description. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
