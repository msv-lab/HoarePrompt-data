### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square. These coordinates are stored in a list `a` of four tuples.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**:
   - The function then extracts the x-coordinates from the list `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**:
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This works because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the x-coordinates of the corners will differ by the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the area of the square for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as described.
- The calculation of the side length using the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is valid because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The area calculation is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
