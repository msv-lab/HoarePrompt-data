You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 and n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 \le a_{ij} \le n) representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, and all a_{ij} are distinct for each line. The sum of n \cdot k across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input. Depending on the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `l1` and `l2`, it either prints 'yes' or 'no'. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are no longer relevant, and the lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` are modified or reset during each iteration, so they do not retain any specific state from one iteration to the next. The only consistent state is that the loop has completed `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D list of integers `a` where each sublist contains `n` distinct integers. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of participants who can see their own screenshots in the given order for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
