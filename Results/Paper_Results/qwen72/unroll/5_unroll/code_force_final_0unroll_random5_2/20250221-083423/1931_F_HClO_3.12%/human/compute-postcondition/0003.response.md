The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by two parameters `n` and `k`, and a 2D list of integers. The parameter `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, and all a_{ij} are distinct for each line. The sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case. Each result is an integer representing the number of participants who can see their own screenshots in the given order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D list of integers `a` where each sublist contains `n` distinct integers. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of participants who can see their own screenshots in the given order for each test case.**
