Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, and all a_{ij} are distinct for each line. The sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.**
