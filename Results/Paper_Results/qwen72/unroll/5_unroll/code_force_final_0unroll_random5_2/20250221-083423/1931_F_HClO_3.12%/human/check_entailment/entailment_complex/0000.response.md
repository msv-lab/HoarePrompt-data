### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (renamed as `m` in the function).
   - If `k` (or `m`) is 1, the function prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case, which is correct because a single screenshot can always be consistent with itself.

2. **First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and stores them in `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
   - It then removes the author of the second screenshot from the first list and the author of the first screenshot from the second list, creating `l11` and `l22`.

3. **Consistency Check for First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function checks if `l11` and `l22` are equal. If they are not, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case, which is correct because the lists should be consistent except for the positions of the authors.

4. **Finding Indices for Swapping:**
   - The function initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and then iterates through the lists to find the indices where the authors of the screenshots should be inserted to make the lists consistent.
   - If the authors are already in the correct positions (i.e., `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`), it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If only one author is in the correct position, it sets the corresponding index and adjusts the pointer (`p1` or `p2`) to 1.
   - If both indices are found, it breaks the loop.

5. **Inserting Authors:**
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, the function inserts the authors into the appropriate lists to make them consistent.
   - If `m` is 2, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case, which is correct because the first two screenshots are already consistent.

6. **Handling Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in a list `val`.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the list `l3` (after removing the author) is consistent with the modified list `l`.
   - If any screenshot is inconsistent, it prints 'no' and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots are consistent, it prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It checks the consistency of the first two screenshots and then ensures that the remaining screenshots are consistent with the modified order. The logic for inserting the authors and checking the remaining screenshots is sound and follows the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
