Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if a given subarray of `c` is "good" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The conditions for a subarray to be good are:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray must equal the sum of elements in some other array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray must be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` must be greater than 0.

The program uses two auxiliary arrays:
- `ones`: This array keeps a cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `nums` up to each index.
- `sum`: This array keeps a cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1 up to each index.

For each query `(l, r)`, the program checks:
- If the subarray has only one element (`l == r`), it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an array `b` that satisfies all conditions.
- Otherwise, it calculates:
  - `onesInRange`: The number of 1s in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]`.
  - `sumInRange`: The sum of the differences between each element in the subarray and 1.

The condition for the subarray to be good is:
\[ 2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

This condition can be simplified to:
\[ \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

This means that the number of 1s in the subarray plus the length of the subarray should be less than or equal to the sum of the differences between each element and 1 in the subarray. This ensures that there are enough "slack" values to create a different array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The use of cumulative arrays (`ones` and `sum`) allows for efficient query processing, which is crucial given the constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.
