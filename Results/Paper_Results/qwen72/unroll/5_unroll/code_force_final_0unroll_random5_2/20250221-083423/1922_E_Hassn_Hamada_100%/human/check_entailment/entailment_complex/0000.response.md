Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the integer `X` for each test case. It processes each test case by calling the function `func_1` with `n - 1` and an initially empty list `result`.

2. **Base Case**: The function `func_1` has a base case where if `number` is 0, it returns `(0, 0)`. This is correct because if `number` is 0, it means we have already generated the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function attempts to find the largest power of 2 that fits within the current `number` and appends a sequence of integers to `sequence` that will contribute to the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The loop iterates over the range from the maximum value in `sequence` to 0, and for each `i`, it calculates the size and value of the next segment to append.
   - The loop correctly identifies the largest segment that fits within `number` and appends the corresponding sequence of integers to `sequence`.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - After appending the segment, the function recursively calls itself with the remaining `number` after subtracting the value of the appended segment.
   - This ensures that the function continues to generate the required number of increasing subsequences until `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the function `func_1` returns without modifying `sequence` (i.e., `number` is 0), the program will print the length and the sequence.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where `X` is 1 correctly. However, the problem description specifies that `X` is at least 2, so this case is not applicable.
   - The program should also handle large values of `X` up to \(10^{18}\). The approach of using powers of 2 and appending segments ensures that the sequence length remains within the limit of 200 for the given range of `X`.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences can be constructed using powers of 2. For example, if `X` is 13, the sequence can be constructed as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - The function correctly identifies the largest segment to append and recursively processes the remaining `number`.

8. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` always returns `(0, 0)`, which is not used in the program. This is not a problem but could be optimized by removing the return statement.
   - The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to find a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the problem description implies that such a sequence always exists for the given range of `X`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
