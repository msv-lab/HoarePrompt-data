### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - If such an array cannot be constructed, we should return `-1`.
   - The array elements should be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `result` and calls the function `func_1` with `n - 1` and `result`.
   - After the function call, it prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is 0. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`, which seems to be a base case.
   - It then iterates over the range from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` such that `value` is the largest power of 2 minus the previous power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends `size - overlap` elements to `sequence` to form the required subsequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and `sequence`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Base Case Handling:** The base case in `func_1` returns `(0, 0)`, which is not used in the main program. This is a potential issue because the base case should handle the termination of the recursion.
   - **Range Calculation:** The range in the loop `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):` is incorrect. `max(sequence, default=0)` should be `max(sequence, default=0) + 1` to ensure the loop starts from the correct value.
   - **Recursive Call:** The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` is incorrect. It should be `func_1(number - value, sequence)` to correctly reduce the `number` by the value of the current subsequence.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the base case.
   - The range calculation in the loop is incorrect.
   - The recursive call is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has multiple issues that prevent it from correctly generating the required array for the given problem description.
