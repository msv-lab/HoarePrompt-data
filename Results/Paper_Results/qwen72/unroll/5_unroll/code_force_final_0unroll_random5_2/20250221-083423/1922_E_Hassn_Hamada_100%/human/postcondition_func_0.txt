The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It appends a series of integers to `sequence` and then recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0). The final state of the program is that `sequence` will have additional integers appended to it, and `number` will be reduced by a specific value based on the largest power of 2 that fits within the original `number`.
