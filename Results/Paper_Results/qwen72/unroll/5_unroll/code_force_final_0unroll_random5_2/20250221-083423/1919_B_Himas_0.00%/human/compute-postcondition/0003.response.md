Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed of '+' and '-' characters. The function then calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the results for each one. The function does not return any value. **
