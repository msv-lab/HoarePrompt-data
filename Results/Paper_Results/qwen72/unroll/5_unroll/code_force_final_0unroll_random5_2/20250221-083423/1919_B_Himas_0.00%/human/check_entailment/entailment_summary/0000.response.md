Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference directly. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then computing the penalty based on the sum of the elements in these subarrays. The difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters does not necessarily correspond to the optimal penalty, especially when the array can be split in a way that minimizes the penalty.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the program outputs `0` because there are an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. However, the correct minimum penalty is also `0`, but this is achieved by splitting the array into subarrays that sum to zero, such as `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. The program does not consider the optimal splitting strategy, which is crucial for the problem.

Similarly, for the fourth test case where `s = "--+++++++-"`, the program outputs `4` because there are 4 more '+' characters than '-' characters. However, the correct minimum penalty is also `4`, but this is achieved by a specific optimal splitting strategy, not just by the difference in counts.

The program does not implement the required logic to split the array and calculate the penalty based on the sum of the subarrays. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
