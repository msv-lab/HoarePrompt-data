Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference for each test case. This does not align with the problem's requirement to compute the penalty based on the sum of the absolute values of the subarrays' sums multiplied by their lengths.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`, which is correct.

2. **Calculation of Penalties**: The program initializes `P` and `M` to 0. It then iterates over the string `s` and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'. Finally, it prints `P - M`.

   - **Issue**: The calculation `P - M` only gives the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the penalty as defined in the problem. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the subarrays' sums multiplied by their lengths.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it directly computes a value that is not related to the penalty calculation.

4. **Output**: The program prints the difference `P - M` for each test case, which is not the correct output. The correct output should be the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Convert the string `s` into the array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
- Implement a logic to split the array `a` into subarrays in such a way that the total penalty is minimized.
- Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total penalty.
- Print the total penalty for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
