You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`, for each pair of elements from the start and end of the list, moving towards the center. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order and then pairing the largest and smallest elements will help achieve this.
   - Specifically, the maximum beauty can be obtained by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It initializes a variable `kq` to 0, which will store the maximum beauty.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, adding the difference between the corresponding largest and smallest elements to `kq`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `kq` for each test case.

4. **Verification**:
   - **First Test Case**:
     - Input: \(n = 3\), \(a = [2, 1, 3]\)
     - Sorted: \(a = [1, 2, 3]\)
     - Differences: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - **Second Test Case**:
     - Input: \(n = 3\), \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
     - Sorted: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
     - Differences: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - Output: 0 (Correct)
   - **Third Test Case**:
     - Input: \(n = 5\), \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
     - Sorted: \(a = [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
     - Differences: \((54 - 43) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 10 + 10 = 31\)
     - However, the correct maximum beauty should be \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 80) = 57 + 36 + 0 = 93\)
     - The program's output: 57 (Incorrect)
   - **Fourth Test Case**:
     - Input: \(n = 4\), \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\)
     - Sorted: \(a = [3, 3, 3, 4]\)
     - Differences: \((3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Output: 1 (Correct)
   - **Fifth Test Case**:
     - Input: \(n = 2\), \(a = [2, 1]\)
     - Sorted: \(a = [1, 2]\)
     - Differences: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
     - Output: 1 (Correct)

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty for all test cases. Specifically, in the third test case, it should sum the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, but it only sums the differences of the first half of the sorted array.
