t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each query (x_i, y_i) is a pair of integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i â‰  y_i. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.
