t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains n as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a list a of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m as an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and m queries each containing two integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
