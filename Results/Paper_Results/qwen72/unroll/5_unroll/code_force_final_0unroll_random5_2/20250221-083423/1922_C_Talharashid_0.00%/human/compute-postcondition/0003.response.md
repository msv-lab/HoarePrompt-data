The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer representing the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `a`: a list of n integers representing the positions of the cities, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
  - `m`: an integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
  - `queries`: a list of m queries, each containing two integers x_i and y_i, where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the index of the closest city to the city specified by the query. The closest city is determined uniquely for each city.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of cities `n`, a list of city positions `a`, the number of queries `m`, and a list of queries `queries`. It returns a list of results, where each result is the index of the closest city to the city specified by the corresponding query.**
