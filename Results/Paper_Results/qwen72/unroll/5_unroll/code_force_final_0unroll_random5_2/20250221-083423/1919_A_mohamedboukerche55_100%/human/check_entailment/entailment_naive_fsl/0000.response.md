Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The logic used in the program is incorrect because it only checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 2
```
According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice has 2 coins, Bob has 2 coins.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
3. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 1 coin and Alice with 1 coin.
4. Alice can now choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
5. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty, so Bob wins.

However, the program would output:
```
Bob
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the program's logic is flawed.

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 1
```
According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice has 3 coins, Bob has 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
3. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
4. Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the program would output:
```
Bob
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly handle the game's rules.

The program's logic of checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is too simplistic and does not account for the game's dynamics, particularly the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
