The function `thing()` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be assumed that the function is part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should determine if it is possible to sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.
