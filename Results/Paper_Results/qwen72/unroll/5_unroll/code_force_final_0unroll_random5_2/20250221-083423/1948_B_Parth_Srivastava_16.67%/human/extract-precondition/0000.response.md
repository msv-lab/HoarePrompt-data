It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description indicates that the function should take parameters for the array and its length, but the function definition does not include any parameters. Let's correct the function definition to match the problem description:

Function definition:
```
def can_sort_array(a, n):
```

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all 0 <= i < n.**
