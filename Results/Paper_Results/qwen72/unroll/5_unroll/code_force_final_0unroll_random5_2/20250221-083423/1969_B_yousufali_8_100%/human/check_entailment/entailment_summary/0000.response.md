Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Function Behavior**: `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input and calculates the cost to sort it.
- **Cost Calculation**: The function iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's (`n`). For each '0' encountered that is preceded by at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
- **Output**: The function prints the total cost.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Function Behavior**: `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` `t` times.
- **Test Case Handling**: Each call to `func_1` processes one test case independently.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Handling of Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading an integer `t` and calling `func_1` `t` times.
2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the number of '1's (`n`) before each '0'.
   - For each '0' that is preceded by at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to the total cost.
   - This approach is based on the observation that to move a '0' past `n` '1's, it requires `n + 1` operations (one for each '1' and one for the '0' itself).

However, there is a subtle issue with the cost calculation in `func_1`:
- **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts is to find the longest contiguous segment of '1's and '0's that are out of order and perform a single cyclic shift on that segment. The cost of such a shift is the length of the segment.
- **Current Implementation**: The current implementation adds `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after at least one '1', which may overestimate the cost in some cases.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: "10"
  - Current Output: 2
  - Correct Output: 2 (one shift of the entire string)
- **Test Case 2**: "0000"
  - Current Output: 0
  - Correct Output: 0 (already sorted)
- **Test Case 3**: "11000"
  - Current Output: 9
  - Correct Output: 3 (one shift of the substring "110" to get "01100" and then "00110" and finally "00011")
- **Test Case 4**: "101011"
  - Current Output: 5
  - Correct Output: 5 (one shift of the substring "10101" to get "110101" and then "111010" and finally "111100")
- **Test Case 5**: "01101001"
  - Current Output: 11
  - Correct Output: 7 (one shift of the substring "0110100" to get "001101001" and then "000110101" and finally "00001111")

### Conclusion:
The current implementation in `func_1` does not always produce the minimum total cost. It overestimates the cost in some cases by adding `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after at least one '1'. The correct approach should find the longest contiguous segment of '1's and '0's that are out of order and perform a single cyclic shift on that segment.

Correctness: **False**
