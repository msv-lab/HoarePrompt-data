The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and two dictionaries `player` and `blud`. It checks if any player's position matches the Bludger's position. If a match is found, the player's position is updated to `[-1, -1]` (indicating elimination), and the player's identifier is added to a list `out`. The function then prints the time step `t` and each player identifier in `out` in ascending order, followed by 'ELIMINATED'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `player` has the positions of any eliminated players updated to `[-1, -1]`, and `out` contains the identifiers of the eliminated players.
