### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch where players from two teams (Red and Blue) move around a field to score goals using a Quaffle.
   - The field also contains goals, a Bludger, and the Quaffle.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team.
   - Scoring a goal in the player's own goal gives a point to the opponent's team.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include the main events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction (`d`).
     - It correctly handles the movement in the four directions (U, D, L, R).
     - The function modifies the object's position in place, which is appropriate for the simulation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly appends the player to the `out` list if they are on the same cell as the Bludger.
     - It then sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are eliminated.
     - The function sorts the `out` list and prints the elimination events in alphabetical order, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Missing Components:**
   - The provided program only includes two functions. It does not include the main logic for:
     - Initializing the field and entities.
     - Simulating the game steps.
     - Handling the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
     - Scoring goals and updating the score.
     - Printing the final score.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle or the Bludger.
   - It does not check if a player is scoring a goal.
   - It does not update the score based on the goals scored.
   - It does not print the final score.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions are correct for their intended purposes (moving an object and handling player eliminations).
   - However, the program is incomplete and lacks the main logic required to simulate the game and produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not cover all the necessary aspects of the problem, such as simulating the game steps, handling the Quaffle and Bludger movements, scoring goals, and printing the final score. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
