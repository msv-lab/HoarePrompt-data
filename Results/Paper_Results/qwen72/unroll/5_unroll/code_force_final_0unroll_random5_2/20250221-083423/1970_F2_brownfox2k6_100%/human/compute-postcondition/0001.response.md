The only objects in the loop head are the variable `p` and the dictionary `player`. For the loop to execute, the dictionary `player` must have at least one key-value pair. The variable `p` will be the first key in the dictionary `player` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `p` is the first key in the dictionary `player`, `blud` is a dictionary with valid positions, `out` is an empty list**
