Postcondition: **obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and d is a string representing the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') in which the entity will move. The coordinates in obj must be within the bounds of the field defined by N and M, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside these bounds. The direction d is not 'U', the direction d is not 'D', the direction d is not 'L', and the current value of d is 'R'.**
