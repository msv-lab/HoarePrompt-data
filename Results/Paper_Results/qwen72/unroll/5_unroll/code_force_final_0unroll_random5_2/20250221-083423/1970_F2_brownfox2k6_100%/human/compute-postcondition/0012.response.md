Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('L', 'R'). If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is decreased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is increased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged. The direction `d` is not 'U', and the direction `d` is not 'D'.***
