The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on a field and a string `d` representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It modifies the coordinates in `obj` based on the direction: 'U' decreases the x-coordinate by 1, 'D' increases the x-coordinate by 1, 'L' decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and 'R' increases the y-coordinate by 1. The function does not return any value, but the coordinates in `obj` are updated in place. The function assumes that the move will not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M, and if `d` is not one of the specified directions, the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
