Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). If `d` is 'U', the first integer in `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first integer in `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer in `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer in `obj` is increased by 1. In all cases, the move does not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.***
