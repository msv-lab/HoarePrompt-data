Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('R'). If `d` is 'R', the coordinates in `obj` are now (obj[0], obj[1] + 1), and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. The direction `d` is not 'U', the direction `d` is not 'D', and the direction `d` is not 'L'. If `d` is not 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.***
