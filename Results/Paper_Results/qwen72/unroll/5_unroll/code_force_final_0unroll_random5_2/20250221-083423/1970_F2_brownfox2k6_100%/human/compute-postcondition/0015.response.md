The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `obj` and `d`. `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on a field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') in which the entity will move. The coordinates in `obj` must be within the bounds of the field defined by N and M, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside these bounds. The function returns the new coordinates of the entity after moving in the specified direction, ensuring that the entity remains within the field boundaries.
