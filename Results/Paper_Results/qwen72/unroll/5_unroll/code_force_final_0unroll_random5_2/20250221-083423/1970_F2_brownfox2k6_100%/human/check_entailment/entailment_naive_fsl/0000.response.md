Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle the movement of entities and the elimination of players due to Bludgers, respectively. However, the program is incomplete and does not handle the full logic required by the problem description. Specifically, it does not handle the following aspects:

1. **Scoring Logic**: The program does not check if a player has placed the Quaffle in the opponent's goal and does not update the score accordingly.
2. **Quaffle Movement**: The program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when it is thrown by a player or when it is placed back in the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
3. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the logic for a player catching the Quaffle.
4. **Final Score Output**: The program does not print the final score at the end of the game.
5. **Initial Field Setup**: The program does not initialize the field or the positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger.
6. **Game Steps Processing**: The program does not process the game steps to simulate the game and determine the events.

Given these missing components, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
