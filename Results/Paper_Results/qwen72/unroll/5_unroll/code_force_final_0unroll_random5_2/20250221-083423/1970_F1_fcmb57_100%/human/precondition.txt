N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. The field is a 2D list of size N x M, where each element is a pair of characters representing an empty cell (..), a player (R0 to R9 or B0 to B9), a goal (RG or BG), or the Quaffle (.Q). T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. The actions list contains T lines, each describing a valid action by a player or the Quaffle.
