The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into two variables `x` and `y`, and `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function raises a TypeError. The function does not return any values.
