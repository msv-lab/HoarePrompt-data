Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly following the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Incorrect Movement Logic**: The movement logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The movement directions are defined as:
   - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left)
   - 'R': (1, 0) (move right)
   - 'U': (0, -1) (move up)
   - 'D': (0, 1) (move down)

   However, the movement logic in `func_1` should be:
   - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left)
   - 'R': (1, 0) (move right)
   - 'U': (0, -1) (move up)
   - 'D': (0, 1) (move down)

   The current implementation is correct, but it's important to verify this.

2. **Handling the Quaffle's Position**: The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's position. The Quaffle's position should be tracked independently of the players, and it should move back to the middle of the field when a goal is scored. The current implementation does not track the Quaffle's position at all.

3. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the action of catching the Quaffle. The problem description states that a player can catch the Quaffle if they are in the same cell as it. The current implementation does not include any logic for catching the Quaffle.

4. **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program does not correctly handle the action of throwing the Quaffle. When a player throws the Quaffle, it should be placed at the player's current position. The current implementation does not include any logic for throwing the Quaffle.

5. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incorrect. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and then check if they are at the opponent's goal. If a player scores in their own goal, the other team should get the point. The current implementation does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
