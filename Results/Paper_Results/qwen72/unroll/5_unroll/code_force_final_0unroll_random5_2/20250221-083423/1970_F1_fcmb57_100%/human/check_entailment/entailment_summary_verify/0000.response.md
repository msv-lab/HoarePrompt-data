### Reasoning:

1. **Movement Logic**:
   - The movement logic in `func_1` is correctly implemented. The function `func_1` takes the current position of an entity (a player or the Quaffle) and a movement direction, and returns the new position after applying the movement. The directions are correctly defined as:
     - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left)
     - 'R': (1, 0) (move right)
     - 'U': (0, -1) (move up)
     - 'D': (0, 1) (move down)
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the positions of players, and it works as expected.

2. **Handling the Quaffle's Position**:
   - The program does not track the Quaffle's position independently. Instead, it assumes that the Quaffle is always carried by a player or is in the middle of the field. This is a significant oversight because the Quaffle can be in any cell on the field and can be caught by a player.
   - The Quaffle should be tracked separately, and its position should be updated when a player catches or throws it. The program does not do this, which means it cannot correctly handle scenarios where the Quaffle is not being carried by a player.

3. **Catching the Quaffle**:
   - The program does not handle the action of catching the Quaffle. The problem description states that a player can catch the Quaffle if they are in the same cell as it. The current implementation does not include any logic for catching the Quaffle.
   - This is a critical missing feature because a player must be able to catch the Quaffle to score a goal.

4. **Throwing the Quaffle**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the action of throwing the Quaffle. When a player throws the Quaffle, it should be placed at the player's current position. The current implementation does not include any logic for throwing the Quaffle.
   - Additionally, the Quaffle should move back to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but the program does not handle this either.

5. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is incorrect. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and then check if they are at the opponent's goal. If a player scores in their own goal, the other team should get the point.
   - The current implementation only checks if the player is at a goal, but it does not verify whether the player is carrying the Quaffle. This means that a player can score a goal even if they are not carrying the Quaffle, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program has several critical issues that prevent it from correctly following the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not track the Quaffle's position independently, does not handle the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle, and has incorrect scoring logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
