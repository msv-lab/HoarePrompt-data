Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to simulate a simplified version of a Quidditch game. The program reads the dimensions of the field, the initial state of the field (including the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle), and a series of actions to be performed. The goal is to track the score based on the actions and output the main events and the final score.

However, there is a critical issue in the `func_1` function, which is responsible for updating the position of a player based on their movement. The function is defined to take two parameters: `a` (a tuple representing the current position of the player) and `b` (a tuple representing the movement direction). The function then attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which is incorrect because `b` is actually a single tuple representing the movement direction, not two separate integers.

The error in the `func_1` function is that it is being called with the second parameter `mouvements[mo[1]]`, which is a tuple, but the function itself is not correctly handling this tuple. This results in a `TypeError` because the function tries to unpack an integer (which is not the case, but the error message is misleading).

To fix this, the `func_1` function should be defined to accept a tuple for the movement direction, and the unpacking should be done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly update the player's position based on the movement direction.

Given the provided state of the program, the function call is incorrect, and the program will raise a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
