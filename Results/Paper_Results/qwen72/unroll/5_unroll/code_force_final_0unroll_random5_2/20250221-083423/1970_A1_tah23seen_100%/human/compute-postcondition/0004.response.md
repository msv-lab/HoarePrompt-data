The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `i` must be initialized to 0. The length of `s` is `n`, which is already defined and is greater than 0 since `s` is non-empty. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string and `i` is 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` (greater than 0); `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0`; `i` is 0**
