The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key-value pair from the dictionary `d` where the key is `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. The dictionary `d` initially contains the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters for each prefix of the string `s`, including the full string `s` itself. After executing the code, the dictionary `d` no longer contains the entry for the full length of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), `d[i]` is the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substring `s[0:i]`.**
