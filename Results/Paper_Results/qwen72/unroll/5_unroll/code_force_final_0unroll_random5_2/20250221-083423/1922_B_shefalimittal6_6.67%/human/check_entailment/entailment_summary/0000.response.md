Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given list of stick lengths, such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. The key observation here is that for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. Given the exponential nature of the lengths, this is only possible if at least two of the sticks have the same length.

The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each length. It then calculates the number of valid triplets in two scenarios:
1. When there are at least three sticks of the same length, it uses `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length.
2. When there are at least two sticks of the same length, it uses `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to count the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length and one stick from the remaining sticks.

However, the program does not correctly account for the second scenario. Specifically, the `total_sum` calculation includes all other sticks, including those of the same length as the current `cnt`. This can lead to overcounting, as it may include cases where all three sticks are of the same length, which are already counted in the first scenario.

To fix this, the `total_sum` should exclude the current `cnt` to avoid double-counting.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        print(res)
```

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        print(res)
```

### Explanation:
- **First Scenario**: If there are at least three sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- **Second Scenario**: If there are at least two sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks and one stick from the remaining sticks is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.

### Correctness:
The original program is **incorrect** because it overcounts the number of valid triplets. The corrected program should exclude the current `cnt` from the `total_sum` calculation to avoid double-counting.

Correctness: **False**
