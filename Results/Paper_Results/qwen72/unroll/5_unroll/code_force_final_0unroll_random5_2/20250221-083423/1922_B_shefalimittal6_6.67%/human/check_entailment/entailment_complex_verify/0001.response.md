### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is done efficiently using a loop and the `get` method.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions:**
   - The program's logic for forming a non-degenerate triangle is based on the fact that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\) is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than the next higher power of 2 (e.g., \(2^1 + 2^1 = 2^2\), but \(2^1 + 2^1 \leq 2^2\)).
   - However, the program also includes a calculation for the scenario where two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length. This part of the logic is incorrect because it does not satisfy the triangle inequality condition. For example, if we have sticks of lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2\), the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks is \(2^1 + 2^1 = 4\), which is equal to \(2^2\), not greater. Therefore, this combination does not form a non-degenerate triangle.

4. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - The incorrect part is the calculation for choosing 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. This should not be included in the count of valid triangles.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of valid combinations of 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, due to the incorrect logic for the second scenario, the results will be incorrect for some test cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Correctness of the Triangle Formation Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length.
  - The combination calculations for choosing 3 sticks of the same length are correct.
  - The combination calculations for choosing 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length are incorrect and should be removed.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
  - The combination calculations are performed using the `math.comb` function, which is efficient for the given constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by not adding any combinations to the result.
  - It also handles the case where there are no sticks of the same length correctly by not adding any combinations to the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically incorrect because it includes a scenario that does not satisfy the triangle inequality condition. Therefore, the results for some test cases will be incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate. The program is incorrect due to the inclusion of an invalid scenario for forming non-degenerate triangles. The correct logic should only consider the scenario where all three sticks have the same length.

Final: **False**
