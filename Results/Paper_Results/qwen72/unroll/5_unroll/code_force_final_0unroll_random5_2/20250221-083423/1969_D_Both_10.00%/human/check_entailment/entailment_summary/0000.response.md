Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases using `func_1()`, which correctly reads an integer from the standard input. This is followed by a loop that processes each test case.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2()`, and then reads the lists `a` and `b` using the same function. This is correct as `func_2()` returns an iterator of integers, which is then converted to a list. The negative values for `a` are stored to facilitate the use of a min-heap later.

3. **Data Preparation**: The program creates a list `arr` where each element is a tuple `[a[i], b[i]]`. This list is then sorted based on the second element (`b[i]`) in ascending order. This sorting step is crucial because it allows Alice to consider the items with the smallest `b[i]` values first, which are the least profitable for Bob to take for free.

4. **Initial Heap Population**: The program initializes a min-heap `k_arr` with the `k` items that have the highest `b[i]` values (since `arr` is sorted in reverse). This is done by pushing the last `k` elements of `arr` into `k_arr` and removing them from `arr`. This step ensures that Bob will take the items with the highest `b[i]` values for free, which is optimal for Bob.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial profit (`sub_sum`) by summing the `a[i]` values of the items in `k_arr` and the `a[i] + b[i]` values of the remaining items in `arr` where `a[i] + b[i] >= 0`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items in `arr`, adjusting the profit by removing the least profitable item from `k_arr` and adding the current item to `k_arr` if it is more profitable. This is done using `heapq.heappushpop()` to maintain the heap property.

6. **Final Profit**: The program updates the maximum profit (`max_value`) if the current `sub_sum` is greater than the previously recorded maximum. This ensures that the final profit is the maximum possible profit Alice can achieve.

7. **Output**: The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, where Alice tries to maximize her profit and Bob tries to minimize it. The use of a min-heap to manage the items Bob can take for free is appropriate, and the profit calculation is done correctly by considering the conditions specified in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
