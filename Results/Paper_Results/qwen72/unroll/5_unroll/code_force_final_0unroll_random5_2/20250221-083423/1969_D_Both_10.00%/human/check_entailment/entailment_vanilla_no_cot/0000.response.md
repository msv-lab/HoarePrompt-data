Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not properly defined. They should use `sys.stdin.readline` to read input, but the function `putin` is not defined in the program. This will cause a runtime error.

2. **Logic for Calculating Profit**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy. Specifically, it does not handle the case where Bob can take `k` items for free and should choose the items that minimize Alice's profit.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob involves sorting the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` and then selecting the items that maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's free items. The provided function `func_3` does not perform this sorting or selection logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys
import heapq

def read_int():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def read_list():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

def solve(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate the profit for each item if Alice buys it and Bob buys it back
    profits = [b_i - a_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)]
    
    # Alice should buy items with the highest profit first
    profits.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate Alice's total profit
    total_profit = sum(profits[:k])
    
    # Bob will take the k items with the highest profit for free
    if n > k:
        total_profit += sum(max(0, profit) for profit in profits[k:])
    
    return total_profit

def main():
    t = read_int()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = read_list()
        a = read_list()
        b = read_list()
        print(solve(n, k, a, b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `read_int` reads a single integer from the input.
   - `read_list` reads a list of integers from the input.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - `profits` is a list of the differences `b_i - a_i` for each item.
   - The list is sorted in descending order to prioritize items with the highest profit.
   - Alice's total profit is calculated by summing the top `k` profits.
   - If there are more than `k` items, Bob will take the top `k` items for free, and Alice will only profit from the remaining items if their profit is positive.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
