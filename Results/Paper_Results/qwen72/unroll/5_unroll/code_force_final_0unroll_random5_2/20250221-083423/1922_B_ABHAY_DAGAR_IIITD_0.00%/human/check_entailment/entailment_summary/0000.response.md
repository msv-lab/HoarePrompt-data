### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in the list `num_list`. This is a valid approach to keep track of how many sticks have the same length.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic:**
   - The program then iterates over the counts of each stick length (`cnt`).
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \). This is correct because any three sticks of the same length can form a triangle.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total_count} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times \text{total_count} \). This is also correct because two sticks of the same length and one stick of a shorter length can form a triangle.
   - The `total_count` is updated to include the current count of sticks, which is used in the next iteration to calculate the number of ways to choose one stick of a different length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 by not adding any valid triangles to the result, which is correct because you need at least 3 sticks to form a triangle.
   - The program also handles the case where all sticks are of different lengths by not adding any valid triangles, which is correct because three sticks of different lengths \(2^{a_i}\) cannot form a triangle if \(a_i\) are distinct.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a triangle. It handles all the edge cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
