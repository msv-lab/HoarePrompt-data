The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a triangle for each test case and appends these results to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the state by printing the results. The `results` list remains unchanged after the function concludes, and each integer in the `results` list represents the number of valid triangle formations for the corresponding test case.
