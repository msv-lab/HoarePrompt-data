Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list named `digits`, which does not affect the values of `n`, `password`, or `letters`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `digits` list.
