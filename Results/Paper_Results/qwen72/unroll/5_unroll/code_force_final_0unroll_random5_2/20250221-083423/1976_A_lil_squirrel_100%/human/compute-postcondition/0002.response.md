The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password`. If `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Given that `password` is a string of length `n` and `1 <= n <= 20`, `password` must have at least one character, ensuring the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `ch` should be the first character of `password`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the first character of `password`, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
