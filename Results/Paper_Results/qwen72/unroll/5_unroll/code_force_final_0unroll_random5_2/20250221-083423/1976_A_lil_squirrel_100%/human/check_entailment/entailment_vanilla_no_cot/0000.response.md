Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if a password meets the specified conditions:
1. It separates the characters of the password into letters and digits.
2. It verifies that all letters are in non-decreasing order.
3. It verifies that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
4. It ensures that no digit comes immediately after a letter.

The logic in the `func_1` function is implemented correctly to meet these conditions, and the program handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
