The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (from the beginning) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (from the end). The function prints the difference between the length of `inpstr` and the sum of these two indices. The function does not return any value.
