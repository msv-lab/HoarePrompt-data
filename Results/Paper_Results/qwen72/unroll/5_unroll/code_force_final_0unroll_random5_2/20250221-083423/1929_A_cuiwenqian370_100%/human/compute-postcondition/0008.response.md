To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for result in results:
```
- **result**: This is the variable that will take on each value from the `results` list during each iteration of the loop.
- **results**: This is the list that the loop will iterate over.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will execute if the `results` list is not empty.
- The variable `result` will be set to the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

### Given State
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Adjusting the State
- **results**: For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. This is the primary condition that needs to be adjusted.
- **result**: This variable will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted manually.

### Final State
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `array`, `data`, `index`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` must be a non-empty list**.
