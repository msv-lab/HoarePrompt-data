### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The elements of the array can be rearranged in any order to maximize this sum.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, which is the opposite of what we want to maximize.
   - The correct approach should be to alternate the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences. For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), we can rearrange it to \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\).

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the length of each array \(n\).
   - It also correctly reads the elements of each array and calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty.
   - However, since `func_1(array)` is incorrect, the overall program will produce incorrect results.

4. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the logic in `func_1(array)` does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1(array)` should be modified to alternate the largest and smallest elements to maximize the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1(array)` does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
