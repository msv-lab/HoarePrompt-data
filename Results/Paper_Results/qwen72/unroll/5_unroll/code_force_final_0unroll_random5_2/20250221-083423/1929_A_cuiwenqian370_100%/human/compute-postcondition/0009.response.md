To accurately determine the output state, let's break down the provided information and the loop:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Loop Code:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
- For each element in `results`, it prints the element.
- The loop does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Output State:
- `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` remains the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `array` remains the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- `index` remains the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop.
- `results` remains the list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.**
