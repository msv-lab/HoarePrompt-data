Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The issue lies in the way the beauty of the array is calculated in `func_1`. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the function `func_1` calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences \(\text{abs}(a_i - a_{i-1})\).

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should not use absolute differences. Instead, we should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This is because the maximum beauty is obtained when the largest elements are placed first, followed by the smallest elements, maximizing the positive differences.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

Additionally, the `func_2` function reads all input at once, which is not the best practice for handling multiple test cases. It would be more appropriate to read input for each test case individually. Here is a revised version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

However, a more readable and efficient way to handle input for each test case would be:

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly solve the problem.
