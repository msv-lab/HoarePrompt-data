### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The elements of the array can be rearranged in any order to maximize this sum.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that this approach is incorrect because sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, which is the opposite of what we want to maximize.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One effective way to do this is to alternate the largest and smallest elements, as suggested in the original assessment.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to alternate the largest and smallest elements. For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), we can rearrange it to \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\).
   - This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the length of each array \(n\).
   - It also correctly reads the elements of each array and calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty.
   - However, since `func_1(array)` is incorrect, the overall program will produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1(array)` does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
