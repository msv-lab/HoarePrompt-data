To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`, which is `n`.
   - Therefore, `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`, which is `n > 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0, so we need to check if `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - This condition depends on the values of the first two elements in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `n > 1` and `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
- Since `n` is the length of `arr`, and it is given that `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, we need to ensure that `n > 1` for the loop to execute.
- The state of `arr` must be such that `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
