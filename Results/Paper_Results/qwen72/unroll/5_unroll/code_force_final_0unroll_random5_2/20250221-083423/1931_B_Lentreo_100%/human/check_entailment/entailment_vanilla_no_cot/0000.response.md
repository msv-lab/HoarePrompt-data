Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. According to the problem, this check is unnecessary because it is guaranteed that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have after the operations, which is `total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check**: The program iterates through the list of water amounts and maintains a running sum `curr` of the differences between the current amount and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to pour water from the current container to a later container to balance the water amounts, and the program returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program returns 'YES'.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water if and only if the running sum `curr` never goes below zero. This is because if `curr` goes below zero, it means that the cumulative deficit in water cannot be compensated by the remaining containers, which would make it impossible to balance the water amounts.

Thus, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
