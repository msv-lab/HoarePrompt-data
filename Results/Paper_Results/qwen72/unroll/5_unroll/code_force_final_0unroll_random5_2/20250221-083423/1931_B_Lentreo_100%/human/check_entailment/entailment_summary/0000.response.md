Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key observation here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the mean amount of water per container is an integer. To achieve equal amounts of water in all containers, we need to ensure that we can pour water in such a way that no container ever has less water than the mean before we finish the process.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the mean amount of water per container and then iterates through the list of water amounts. For each container, it updates a cumulative deviation (`curr`) from the mean. If at any point the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it means that the water in the containers up to that point is less than the required mean, and it is impossible to achieve the mean amount in all containers by only pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers. Therefore, the function returns 'NO'. If the cumulative deviation never becomes negative, it means that it is possible to achieve the mean amount in all containers, and the function returns 'YES'.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the water can be redistributed in a way that maintains the necessary condition for equalization. The function correctly handles the problem constraints and logic.

Correctness: **True**
