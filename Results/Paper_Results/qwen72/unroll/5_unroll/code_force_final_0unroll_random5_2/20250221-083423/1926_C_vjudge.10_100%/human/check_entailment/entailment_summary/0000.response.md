Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.

2. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 200000 and stores these values in the list `values`. This is an efficient approach because it avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each test case, which would be computationally expensive and likely exceed the time limit.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: For each integer `i` from 1 to 200000, the program calculates the sum of its digits by converting the integer to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`. This method is correct and straightforward.

4. **Cumulative Sum Storage**: The program stores the cumulative sum of the digits in the list `values` such that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. This is achieved by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i - 1]`.

5. **Output for Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum from the `values` list and prints it. This ensures that the output is correct and efficient.

6. **Time Complexity**: The precomputation step runs in O(200000 * d) time, where `d` is the number of digits in the largest number (200000), which is a constant. The processing of each test case is O(1) due to the precomputation. Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and should meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

7. **Space Complexity**: The program uses a list `values` of size 200001 to store the cumulative sums, which is within the acceptable memory limits.

8. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1, 2, or 3, and when `n` is a large number like 200000.

Given the above points, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
