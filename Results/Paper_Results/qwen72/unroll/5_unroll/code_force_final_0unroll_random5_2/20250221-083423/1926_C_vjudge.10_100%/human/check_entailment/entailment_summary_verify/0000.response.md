### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases.
   - The constraints are \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by initializing a large list `values` of size \(2 \cdot 10^5 + 1\) with zeros. This list is used to store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` list with the cumulative sum.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value` and prints the precomputed sum from the `values` list.

3. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `values` list is correctly precomputed to store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Efficiency**:
   - **Precomputation Step**: The precomputation step iterates through \(2 \cdot 10^5\) integers, calculating the sum of digits for each integer and updating the cumulative sum. This step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n = 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - **Test Case Handling**: Each test case is handled in \(O(1)\) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` list.
   - Given the constraints, the precomputation step is efficient and the test case handling is very fast, well within the 0.5 seconds per test case limit.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores these sums in the `values` list.
   - For each test case, it correctly retrieves the precomputed sum and prints it.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct and efficient for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
