Output State: **`t` is the input integer provided by the user, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.** 

The function takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes. `inf` is set to 200001, and `values` is initialized as a list containing 200001 zeros. The value of `t` and `inf` remain unchanged, and `values` is now a list of 200001 zeros.
