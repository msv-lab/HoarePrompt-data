The function `func_1` is described with parameter constraints but does not actually accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the constraints given, the function should logically accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` is an integer representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case. The function should return the results for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `n` is the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `n`.**
