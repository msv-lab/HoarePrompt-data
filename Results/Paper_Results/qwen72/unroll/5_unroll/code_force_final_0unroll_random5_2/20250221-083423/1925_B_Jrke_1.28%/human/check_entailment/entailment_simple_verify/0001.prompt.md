You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]

        print(ans)

    #State: The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` for each iteration, where `k` is `x // n`. If `k` is 1, it will print 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the optimal solution is to assign each sub-problem a difficulty of `x // n`, and the GCD will be `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k` divides `x` and `k` is less than or equal to `x // n`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the maximum possible difficulty for each sub-problem if `x` were evenly divisible by `n`.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `1` because the only possible GCD in this case is `1`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to `1` and iterates over possible divisors of `x` starting from `1` (or `2` if `x` is even) up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of `2`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a valid divisor and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `i` as a potential GCD.
   - If `x // i` is a valid divisor and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `x // i` as a potential GCD.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors found.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only considers odd divisors starting from `1` (or `2` if `x` is even). This might miss some even divisors.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is even and `n` is odd, which could lead to incorrect results.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1`.
   - However, it does not consider all possible divisors of `x`, which could lead to missing the optimal solution.
   - The range and step size of the loop might not cover all necessary divisors, especially for even `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not consider all possible divisors of `x`, which could lead to missing the optimal solution.

Correctness: **False**
