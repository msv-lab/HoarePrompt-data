Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it checks if there is a pair of indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the beginning of each test case. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after each test case, and the loop continues until `t` reaches 0. The list `l` and the integer `n` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
