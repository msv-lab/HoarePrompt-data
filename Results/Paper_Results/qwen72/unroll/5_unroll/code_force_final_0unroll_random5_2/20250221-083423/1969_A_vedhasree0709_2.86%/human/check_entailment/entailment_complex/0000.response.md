Reasoning:

The provided function `func` attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if there is a specific pattern in the list `l` that meets the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. However, this approach is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Pattern Check**: The condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is not a general solution to the problem. It only checks for a very specific pattern where the best friend of friend `i` is `i + 2` and the best friend of friend `i + 1` is `i + 1`. This pattern is not guaranteed to exist in every test case and does not cover all possible scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Output**: The function prints `2` if the specific pattern is found and `3` otherwise. This is not always correct. For example, in the second test case provided in the problem description, the correct output is `3`, but the function would print `3` even if the specific pattern is not found, which is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.

3. **No Handling of General Cases**: The function does not handle the general case where the best friend relationships form cycles or chains. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 2, the function should print `2`. If they form a cycle of length 3 or more, the function should print the length of the smallest cycle.

4. **Input Handling**: The function reads input directly from `input()`, which is fine for a standalone script, but it does not match the problem description's requirement for a function with parameters `t` and `test_cases`.

5. **Variable `t` and `test_cases`**: The function does not use the variables `t` and `test_cases` as described in the problem. Instead, it reads input directly, which is not the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Given these issues, the function is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
