The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `t` and `test_cases` should be considered to ensure the loop can execute based on the problem description.

Given the problem description, `t` should be the number of iterations, and `test_cases` should be a list of tuples as described. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be greater than 0 and `test_cases` must contain the appropriate data.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct), `_` is a throwaway variable, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
