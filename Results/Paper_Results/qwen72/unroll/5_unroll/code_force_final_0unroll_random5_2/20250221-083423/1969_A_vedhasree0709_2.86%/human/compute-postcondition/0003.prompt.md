You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends for each friend.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it checks if there is a pair of indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the beginning of each test case. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after each test case, and the loop continues until `t` reaches 0. The list `l` and the integer `n` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to pair each friend with their best friend such that every friend is paired with exactly one other friend, and no friend is paired with themselves. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the pairing is possible, or "No" if it is not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
