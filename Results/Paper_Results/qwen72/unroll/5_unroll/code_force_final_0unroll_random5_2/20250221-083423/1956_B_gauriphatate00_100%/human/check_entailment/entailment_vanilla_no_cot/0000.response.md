Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only counts how many integers in your hand appear exactly twice, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points you can get when playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
1. If you have a card with a number that appears only once in your hand, you will never score a point with that card because Nene will play her matching card before you if she has it.
2. If you have a card with a number that appears twice in your hand, you can score a point with the second play of that card if Nene does not have the matching card or if you play the first card before Nene does.

The correct approach involves:
- Counting the occurrences of each number in your hand.
- Determining how many numbers appear exactly once and exactly twice.
- Calculating the maximum points you can score by playing the cards optimally, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let's correct the function:

```python
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    # Count how many numbers appear exactly once and exactly twice in your hand
    single_count = 0
    double_count = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 1:
                single_count += 1
            elif count_a[num] == 2:
                double_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the maximum points you can get
    max_score = min(double_count, n - single_count)
    
    return max_score
```

This function correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the optimal play of both you and Nene. The `min(double_count, n - single_count)` ensures that you only count the points you can get if Nene plays optimally to minimize your score.
