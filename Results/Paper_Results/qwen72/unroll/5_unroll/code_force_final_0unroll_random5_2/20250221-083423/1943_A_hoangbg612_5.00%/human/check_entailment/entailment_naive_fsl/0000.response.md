Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX value and the conditions for updating the `cur` variable are flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `N` after sorting is `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
- Alice and Bob play optimally, and the optimal strategy would be:
  1. Alice picks `0` (c = [0], a = [1, 1, 2, 2]).
  2. Bob picks `1` (c = [0], a = [1, 2, 2]).
  3. Alice picks `1` (c = [0, 1], a = [2, 2]).
  4. Bob picks `2` (c = [0, 1], a = [2]).
  5. Alice picks `2` (c = [0, 1, 2], a = []).

At the end, the array `c` is `[0, 1, 2]`, and the MEX of `c` is `3`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `2`.

The issue lies in the way the program updates the `cur` variable and the dictionary `M`. The program does not correctly account for the optimal play by both Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect MEX values in certain cases.
