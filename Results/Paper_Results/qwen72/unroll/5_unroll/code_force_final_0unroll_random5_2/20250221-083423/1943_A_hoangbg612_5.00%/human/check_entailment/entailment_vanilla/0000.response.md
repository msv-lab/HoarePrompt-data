### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good approach because it helps in efficiently finding the MEX by ensuring that we can check the smallest missing integer in a sequential manner.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value as the game progresses.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - For each number `num` in the array:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is exactly `cur + 1`. If it is, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there is a gap in the sequence, and the MEX is `cur + 1`. The program then breaks out of the loop.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If it does, it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, and the MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If it finds such a number, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - By sorting the array and tracking the MEX, the program ensures that Alice and Bob are making optimal moves. Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that can extend the sequence, and Bob will try to pick the smallest number that can break the sequence.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element.
  - It also correctly handles cases where the array contains repeated elements.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The subsequent iteration through the sorted array and dictionary operations are linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness: **True**
