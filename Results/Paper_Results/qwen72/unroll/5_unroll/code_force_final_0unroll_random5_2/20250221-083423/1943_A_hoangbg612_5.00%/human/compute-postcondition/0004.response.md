Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It then sorts the list `N` and determines the largest integer `cur` such that the number of occurrences of each integer from 0 to `cur` in the list `N` is at most equal to the integer itself. Finally, it prints the value of `cur` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` (as described in the initial state) are not directly modified by the function. **
