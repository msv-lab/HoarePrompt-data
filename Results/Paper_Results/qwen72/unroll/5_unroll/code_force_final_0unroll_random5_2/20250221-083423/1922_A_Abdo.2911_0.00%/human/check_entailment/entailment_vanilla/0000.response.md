### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase character to the template.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if string `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase character. If they are different, the template should have an uppercase character to ensure that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The conditions for matching `a` and `b` with the template are correctly implemented.
  - The conditions for ensuring `c` does not match the template are also correctly implemented.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are the same and where `a` and `b` are different.
  - It correctly handles the case where `c` matches the template in any position.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The reasoning and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
