The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The integer `n` must be between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and each of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` must consist of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` that meet the specified constraints, and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
