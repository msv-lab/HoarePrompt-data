Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Template Construction**:
   - The function constructs a template by iterating over the characters of `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, it appends the lowercase character `a[i]` to the template.
   - If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template.
   - This construction ensures that `a` and `b` will match the template if:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template will have the same lowercase character.
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template will have an uppercase character, which ensures that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - This check is logically sound and correctly implemented.

4. **Matching Check for `c`**:
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is different from the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
   - This check is also logically sound and correctly implemented.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   - It prints 'NO' otherwise.
   - The output is correct based on the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are identical by constructing a template that matches both.
   - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` differ by constructing a template that ensures `c` does not match.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
