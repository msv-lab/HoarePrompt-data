Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the conditions for matching the template. Specifically, there are a few issues:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs the template by appending the lowercase letter if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, and the uppercase version of `a[i]` otherwise. This is not always correct. For example, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template should be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by ensuring that if the template has a lowercase letter, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as the template. However, it should also ensure that if the template has an uppercase letter, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template.
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template by ensuring that if the template has a lowercase letter, `c[i]` must be different from the template. However, it should also ensure that if the template has an uppercase letter, `c[i]` must be the same as the lowercase version of the template.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     3
     acc
     abd
     abc
     ```
     The program constructs the template as `['a', 'b', 'D']`. However, `a` and `b` do not match this template because `b[1]` is 'b' and the template has 'B' at the same position. The correct template should be `['A', 'B', 'D']` to ensure `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Find an uppercase letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                    if ch.lower() != a[i] and ch.lower() != b[i]:
                        template.append(ch)
                        break
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            else:
                if a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == template[i].lower():
                    match_c = False
                    break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly and that the matching conditions are properly checked.
