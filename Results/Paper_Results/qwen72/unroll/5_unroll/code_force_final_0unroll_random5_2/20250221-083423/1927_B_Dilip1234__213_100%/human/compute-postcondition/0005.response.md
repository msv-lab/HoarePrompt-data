The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i < n. The function returns a string `s` of length `n`, where the characters in `s` are determined by the counts in the `char_count` list. This list tracks the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' appears in the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a string `s` of length `n` composed of characters from 'a' to 'z', where the frequency of each character is determined by the `char_count` list.**
