### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` to the `test_cases` list.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track the robot's ability to reach the end of the grid.
   - The loop iterates over each column `j` in the grid.
   - If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`), the robot can move to the next column.
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move down to the second row.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`), the robot can no longer move in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
     - If the robot is not in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `False`), it checks if the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`).
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the end of the second row.
   - After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the `results` list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for `reachable_second_row`:**
  - The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if row1[j] == '>' and j == n - 1` should be sufficient to set `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move down to the second row from the last column of the first row.
  - However, the program also has a condition `if reachable_second_row: if row2[j] == '>' and j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True`, which is redundant and incorrect. The robot should already be in the second row if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, and it should check if it can move to the end of the second row.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot should be able to move from the first row to the second row if it reaches the last column of the first row.
- The robot should be able to move along the second row if it is in the second row and the arrow points to the right.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is flawed in the way it handles the transition from the first row to the second row and the movement along the second row.
- The redundant and incorrect condition for `reachable_second_row` can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row and the movement along the second row, leading to potential incorrect results.
