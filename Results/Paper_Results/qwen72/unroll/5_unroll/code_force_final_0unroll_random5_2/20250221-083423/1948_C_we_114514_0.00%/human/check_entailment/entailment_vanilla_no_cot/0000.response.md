Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

1. **Initial Setup and Loop**:
   - The program initializes `reachable_first_row` as `True` and `reachable_second_row` as `False`.
   - It then iterates through each column of the grid.

2. **First Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the arrow in the current cell.
   - If the arrow points to the right (`>`), it continues to the next cell.
   - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the arrow in the second row points to the right (`>`). If it does, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Second Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it checks the arrow in the current cell.
   - If the arrow points to the right (`>`), it continues to the next cell.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the left (`<`). It should set `reachable_second_row` to `False` and check if the arrow in the first row points to the right (`>`).

4. **Final Check**:
   - The program checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True` at the end of the loop to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        if not reachable_second_row:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Second Row Check**: If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the left (`<`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `False` and checks if the arrow in the first row points to the right (`>`). If it does, it sets `reachable_first_row` to `True`.
- **Final Check**: The program now correctly checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by ensuring that `reachable_second_row` is `True` and the last cell in the second row points to the right (`>`).

This corrected program should now correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for each test case.
