Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the winner based on the game rules. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to count the trailing zeros of a number, but the program incorrectly uses this function to determine the winner. The logic for subtracting the number of zeros in pairs and then comparing the total number of digits to `m + 1` is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Sashah
```

The program incorrectly outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the game rules, such as reversing the digits of the numbers and then concatenating them. The logic for determining the winner is not aligned with the game's optimal play strategy.
