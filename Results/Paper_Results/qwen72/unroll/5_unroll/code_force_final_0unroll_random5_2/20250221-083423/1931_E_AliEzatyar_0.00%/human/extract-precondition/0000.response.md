Precondition: **num is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take multiple parameters to handle the game logic, including the list of integers and the parameters n and m. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and the list of integers `a`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains integers n and m, and a list of integers a, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
