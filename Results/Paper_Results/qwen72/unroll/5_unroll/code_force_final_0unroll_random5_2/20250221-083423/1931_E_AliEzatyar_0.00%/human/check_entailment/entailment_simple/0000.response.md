### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `n_test` and initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string representation of the integers.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the function `func_1` and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to determine the winner by considering the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - It sorts the list `zeros` in descending order and subtracts the sum of every second element (starting from the first) from the total number of digits. This is intended to simulate the optimal play where Sasha tries to maximize the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is used to determine if the final number will have at least `m + 1` digits, which would mean Sasha wins.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case, but there is a typo in the string `'Sashah'` which should be `'Sasha'`.

### Issues:
- **Typo in Output String:**
  - The string `'Sashah'` should be `'Sasha'`. This is a minor issue but will cause the output to be incorrect.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the typo is fixed.
- **False** if the typo is not fixed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Fix the typo here
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The typo in the string `'Sashah'` is corrected to `'Sasha'` to ensure the output matches the expected format.
