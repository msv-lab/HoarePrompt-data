Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the function is not used correctly in the main logic. The function should be applied to each element in the list `array` to count trailing zeros, but the program is not using this information effectively.

2. **Trailing Zeros Handling**: The program attempts to use the trailing zeros to adjust the total number of digits, but the logic is flawed. The variable `subtract_zero` is intended to subtract the number of trailing zeros, but it is only subtracting the number of trailing zeros in pairs. This is not the correct approach to determine the game's outcome.

3. **Winning Condition**: The winning condition is based on the total number of digits after Anna's and Sasha's moves. The program checks if the total number of digits minus the number of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. However, the correct condition should consider the optimal play for both players, which involves more complex logic than just subtracting trailing zeros.

4. **Output Error**: The program outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha", which is a typo and will result in incorrect output.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
