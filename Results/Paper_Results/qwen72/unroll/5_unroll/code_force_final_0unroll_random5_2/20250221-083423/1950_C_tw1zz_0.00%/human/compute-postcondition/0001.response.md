Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the input time in 24-hour format will be converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and printed. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their values will not persist outside the loop. After all iterations, the loop will have completed and the program will terminate.**
