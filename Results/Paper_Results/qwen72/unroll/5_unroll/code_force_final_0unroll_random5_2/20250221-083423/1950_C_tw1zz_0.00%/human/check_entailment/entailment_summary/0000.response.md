Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Redundant Conditions**: The conditions for hours from 01 to 12 are redundant because they all set `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to 'AM'. This can be simplified.

2. **Incorrect Handling of 12:00 PM**: The program incorrectly sets `12:00` to 'AM' instead of 'PM'. This is a critical error because 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

3. **Handling of 00:00**: The program correctly handles `00:00` by converting it to `12:00 AM`.

4. **General Conversion Logic**: The program should handle the conversion of hours from 13 to 23 by subtracting 12 from the hour and setting `time` to 'PM'. This is not done efficiently in the current implementation.

5. **Simplification**: The conversion logic can be simplified using a single conditional block and arithmetic operations.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases properly, particularly the conversion of `12:00` to 'PM'.

Correctness: **False**
