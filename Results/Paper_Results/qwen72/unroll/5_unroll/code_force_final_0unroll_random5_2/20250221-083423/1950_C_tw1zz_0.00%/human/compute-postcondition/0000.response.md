The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the number of iterations must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for `t`.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1440 (inclusive)**
