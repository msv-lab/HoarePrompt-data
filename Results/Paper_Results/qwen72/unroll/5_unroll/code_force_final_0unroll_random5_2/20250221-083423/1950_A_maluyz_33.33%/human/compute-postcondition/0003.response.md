The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9), and returns a result for each test case.**
