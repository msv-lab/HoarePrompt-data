The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each test case.
