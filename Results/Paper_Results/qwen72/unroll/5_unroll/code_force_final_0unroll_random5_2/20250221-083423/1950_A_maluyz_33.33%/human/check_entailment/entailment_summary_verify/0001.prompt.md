You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It then checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If true, it prints "NONE".
   - Next, it checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using `max(a, b, c) == b`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
   - The condition `a == b == c` correctly identifies when all digits are the same, which should be "NONE".
   - The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` correctly identifies a peak. This is because `b` being the maximum means `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which satisfies the peak condition `a < b > c`.
   - The else condition correctly handles all other cases, which should be "NONE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where `b` is not the maximum but the digits do not form a stair (e.g., `4 1 7`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
