You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `n` and `m` are updated for each iteration based on the input, and the loop completes after `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the program returns to its caller.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will only change if the number of moves is odd. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 2`:
- After 3 moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only be 1, 3, or 5 (all odd numbers).
- The program will incorrectly output "NO" because `(3 - 2) % 2 == 1`, but the correct answer should be "Yes" because it is possible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves (e.g., put, put, remove).

The correct condition should be:
```python
if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
