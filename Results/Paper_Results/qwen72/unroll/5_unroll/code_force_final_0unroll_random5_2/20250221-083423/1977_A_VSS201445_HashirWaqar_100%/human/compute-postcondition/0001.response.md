Output State: **The loop executes for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `n` and `m` are updated for each iteration based on the input, and the loop completes after `t` iterations.**
