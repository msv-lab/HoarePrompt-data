Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 100 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 1 \le n, m \le 100 \) (number of moves and target number of cubes)

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( n \) is the number of moves and \( m \) is the target number of cubes, the difference \( n - m \) must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the total number of moves is even.
   - Additionally, \( n \) must be at least as large as \( m \) because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if you start from 0 cubes.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \ge m \) and if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Verification**:
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach \( m \) cubes.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the balance of additions and removals.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 3 \): \( n \ge m \) and \( (3 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \), so the output is 'YES'.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \): \( n < m \), so the output is 'NO'.
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \): \( n \ge m \) and \( (5 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \), so the output is 'YES'.

7. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func`.
   - It accurately states that the function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( m \), checking the conditions, and printing the appropriate result.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
