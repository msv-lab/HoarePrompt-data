The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the program returns to its caller.
