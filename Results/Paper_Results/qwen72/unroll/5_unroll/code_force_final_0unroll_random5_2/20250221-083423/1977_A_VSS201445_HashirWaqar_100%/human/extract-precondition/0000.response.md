Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the correct implementation, the function should be defined as:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`. Here is the corrected precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and test_cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple (n, m) and n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.**
