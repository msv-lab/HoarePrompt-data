The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the periodicities of signs and `n` is the number of signs. The function calculates the last year when all signs align based on their periodicities and appends this year to a results list. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.
