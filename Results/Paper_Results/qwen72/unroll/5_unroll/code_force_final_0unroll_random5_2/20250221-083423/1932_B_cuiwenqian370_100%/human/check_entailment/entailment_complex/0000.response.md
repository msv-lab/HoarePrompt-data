### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - The first element of `data` is the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign.
   - The formula used to calculate the next year is:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The function appends the calculated `last_year` for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

4. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\right) // a[i] \times a[i]\) correctly computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by simply returning `a[0]`.
   - It also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly, as the signs will occur every year, and the last sign will occur in the year `n`.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the function aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the signs occur in the correct sequence and the final year is calculated accurately.
