Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(a, n):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for each a_i in a.**
