The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must be a non-empty list. The state of `r` will be automatically set by the loop to the first element of `vals` on the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20
- `N` is an input integer
- `vals` is a list of integers read from the input
- `prod` is 1

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `vals` is non-empty and `r` is set to the first element of `vals`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the first element of `vals`, `prod` is 1**
