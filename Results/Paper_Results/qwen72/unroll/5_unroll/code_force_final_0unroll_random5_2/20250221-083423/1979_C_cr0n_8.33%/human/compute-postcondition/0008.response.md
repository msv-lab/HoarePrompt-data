Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is the result of `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `-1`.
   - The value of `den` is explicitly stated to be less than or equal to 0.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state; it simply prints the constant value `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, or `den`.

Output: **-1**
