Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, N is an input integer.**

The value of `N` is assigned the result of `int(input().strip())`, which converts the input to an integer. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
