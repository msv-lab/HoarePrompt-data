Functionality: ** The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. For each test case, the function reads the constraints, categorizes them into three lists (`big`, `less`, `no`), and then finds the smallest integer `num` that is greater than all values in `big`, less than all values in `less`, and not in `no`. If such an integer exists, it prints `num`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` are not modified by the function. **
