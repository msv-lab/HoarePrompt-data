You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, representing the type of constraint and the value x, respectively. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the exact same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `loop` times, and for each iteration, it will read `innerLoop` lines of input, process the constraints, and print a number `num` that satisfies the constraints (if such a number exists). The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The function returns the result of processing each test case, ensuring that each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, with no two constraints being the same.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
