### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `cur` to -1, which is used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `N`.
   - The function iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The function then checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal play.
   - The function also checks if there are at least two unique elements in `M` with a frequency of 1. If so, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique element, which is also incorrect.

4. **MEX Calculation Issues:**
   - The MEX calculation logic is flawed. The function should not break out of the loop just because `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Instead, it should continue to find the smallest missing integer.
   - The logic for handling the frequencies in `M` is incorrect. The function should not increment `cur` based on the sum of frequencies or set `cur` to the second smallest unique element.

5. **Correct MEX Calculation:**
   - The correct approach would be to iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the smallest integer that is not present in the array. This can be done by maintaining a variable `mex` starting from 0 and incrementing it until it is not found in the array.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The MEX calculation logic is flawed, and the program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
