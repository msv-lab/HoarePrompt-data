Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines the final MEX value. The program attempts to track the elements that are added to the array `c` by using a dictionary `M` and a variable `cur` to keep track of the current MEX. However, the logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop when it encounters a number greater than `cur + 1`. This is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
   - The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c` after all elements have been processed.

2. **Handling of Duplicates**:
   - The program incorrectly handles duplicates by incrementing the count in the dictionary `M` when it encounters a number that is already in `M`. This does not reflect the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

3. **Final MEX Update**:
   - The program updates `cur` to `cnt[1]` if there are at least two unique elements in `cnt`. This is not a valid way to determine the final MEX, as it does not consider the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the optimal strategies of both players. Alice will always try to add the smallest missing integer to `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so by removing the smallest missing integer if possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Initialize MEX to 0
        mex = 0
        
        # Track the number of elements Alice and Bob can pick
        alice_turns = (S + 1) // 2
        bob_turns = S // 2
        
        # Create a set to keep track of elements in N
        elements = set(N)
        
        # Determine the MEX
        for i in range(S):
            if mex not in elements:
                break
            mex += 1
        
        # If Alice can pick the MEX, she will
        if mex in elements and alice_turns > 0:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - `alice_turns` and `bob_turns` are calculated to determine how many turns each player has.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - We use a set `elements` to keep track of the unique elements in `N`.
   - We iterate through the range of `S` and check if the current `mex` is in `elements`. If it is not, we break the loop, as this is the MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - If `mex` is in `elements` and Alice has at least one turn left, she will pick it, and we increment `mex` by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The final MEX is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is correctly determined.
