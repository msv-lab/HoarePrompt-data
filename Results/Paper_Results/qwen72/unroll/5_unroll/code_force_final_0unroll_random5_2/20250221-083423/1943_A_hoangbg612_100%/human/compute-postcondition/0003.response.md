The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. `n` is the size of the array `a` for each test case, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers for each test case, where 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the array `a` for each test case, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the given constraints.**
