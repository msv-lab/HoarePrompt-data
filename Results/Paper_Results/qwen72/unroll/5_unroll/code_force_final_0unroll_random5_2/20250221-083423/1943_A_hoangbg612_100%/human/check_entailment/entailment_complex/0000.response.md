Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func` should take parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` as described in the problem. However, the provided function does not take any parameters. This is a critical issue because the function needs to process the input for each test case. The function should be defined as `def func(t, n, a):` to correctly handle the input.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

3. **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to simplify the process of finding the MEX.

4. **Processing the Array**: The function uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the elements in the array `N` and their counts. It iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` to the current element if it is greater than the previous `cur`. If an element is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop, which is intended to find the MEX.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**: The function checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array). If so, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle the case where all elements are present, but it is not necessary for finding the MEX.

6. **Handling Single Occurrences**: The function creates a list `cnt` of elements that occur exactly once in the array. If there are at least two such elements, it sets `cur` to the second element in this list. This step is intended to optimize the MEX calculation, but it is not correct for the given problem.

7. **Output**: The function prints the value of `cur` for each test case.

**Issues**:
- **Function Definition**: The function should take parameters to handle the input correctly.
- **Handling Single Occurrences**: The logic for handling elements that occur exactly once is incorrect. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, and this logic does not correctly determine the MEX.

**Correct Approach**:
- The function should take parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`.
- For each test case, the function should determine the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
