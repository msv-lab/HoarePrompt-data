### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func` is defined without any parameters. However, it reads inputs from `stdin` within the function, which is a common practice in competitive programming. Therefore, this is not an issue in the context of the problem.

2. **Input Reading**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good step to facilitate the MEX calculation.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the sorted array `N`.
   - The loop iterates through each element in `N`:
     - If the element is greater than `cur`, it checks if it is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current element and sets the frequency in `M`.
   - If the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle the case where all elements are distinct and the MEX is the next integer after the largest element.

5. **Handling Single Occurrences**:
   - A list `cnt` is created to store elements from `M` that have a frequency of 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` is set to the second element in `cnt`. This step is intended to handle the case where Alice and Bob can both pick the same element, but it is not clear why this is necessary or how it affects the MEX calculation.

6. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Handling Single Occurrences**: The step where `cur` is set to the second element in `cnt` if `cnt` has at least two elements is not necessary for the MEX calculation. The MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, and this step does not contribute to that logic.
- **MEX Calculation Logic**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The loop breaks too early if it finds an element greater than `cur + 1`, which may not always be the correct MEX. The correct MEX should be determined by the smallest integer not present in the array, not just by breaking the loop.

### Corrected Logic:
- The correct approach to determine the MEX is to iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the smallest integer not present in the array. This can be done by maintaining a counter and checking if the current element matches the counter. If it does, increment the counter. If it does not, the MEX is the current value of the counter.

### Correctness:
- The given program is incorrect due to the flawed MEX calculation logic and the unnecessary handling of single occurrences.

### Correctness: **False**
