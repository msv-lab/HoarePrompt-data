Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program `func` indeed constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It initializes the variable `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - By starting from the end and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for the current prefix of `p` at each step. This is because the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set `{p_1, p_2, ..., p_i}`.
   - The variable `mex` is updated to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]` to reflect the correct MEX for the next iteration.

4. **Permutation Validity**:
   - The program constructs `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true for each `i`.
   - By ensuring that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix, the program guarantees that the permutation `p` is valid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, `a` will be `[0]` (since `MEX(0) - 0 = 0`), and `p` will be `[0]`.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and permutation construction are robust to these values.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`
   - Iterate backwards:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Final `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`
   - Iterate backwards:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Final `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 3`
   - Iterate backwards:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Final `p = [2, 0, 1]`

In all cases, the program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Final: **True**
