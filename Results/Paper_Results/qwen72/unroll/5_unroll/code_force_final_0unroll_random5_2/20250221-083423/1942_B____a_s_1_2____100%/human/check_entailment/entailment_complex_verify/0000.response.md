Reasoning:

The original assessment is largely accurate, but let's delve deeper into the program's logic to ensure it is correct in all scenarios.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all positions, which is a good starting point since we need to fill in the values.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Verification:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
  - The program ensures that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix of `p` by updating it in each iteration. This is crucial because the MEX value must be updated to reflect the current state of the permutation.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program constructs `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true for each `i`.
  - By starting from the end and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and used to construct `p`. This approach is valid because the MEX of a prefix of `p` is always a non-negative integer, and the program ensures that `p[i]` is a valid value that fits the MEX condition.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly. For `n = 1`, `a` will be a single element, and the program will correctly set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`, which is `1 - a[0]`.
  - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and permutation construction are robust to these values. The program ensures that `p[i]` is always a non-negative integer and that the MEX is updated correctly.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem description:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

1. **i = 4**:
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 3]`

2. **i = 3**:
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, 2, 3]`

3. **i = 2**:
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
   - `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
   - `p = [-1, -1, 4, 2, 3]`

4. **i = 1**:
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
   - `p = [-1, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

5. **i = 0**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

The final permutation `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` is correct because:
- `a[0] = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
- `a[1] = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
- `a[2] = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
- `a[3] = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
- `a[4] = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

1. **i = 4**:
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`
   - `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 4]`

2. **i = 3**:
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, 3, 4]`

3. **i = 2**:
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
   - `p = [-1, -1, 2, 3, 4]`

4. **i = 1**:
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
   - `p = [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

5. **i = 0**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

The final permutation `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is correct because:
- `a[0] = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
- `a[1] = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
- `a[2] = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`
- `a[3] = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`
- `a[4] = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 3`

1. **i = 2**:
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
   - `p = [-1, -1, 1]`

2. **i = 1**:
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - `p = [-1, 0, 1]`

3. **i = 0**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`
   - `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - `p = [2, 0, 1]`

The final permutation `p = [2, 0, 1]` is correct because:
- `a[0] = MEX(2) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2`
- `a[1] = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
- `a[2] = MEX(2, 0, 1) -
