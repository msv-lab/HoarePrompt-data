Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data. For each test case, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is calculated as p[i] = mex - a[i] and mex is updated to be the minimum of mex and p[i], starting with mex = n. The final values of p for each test case are printed.**
