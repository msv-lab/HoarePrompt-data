Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**

The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
