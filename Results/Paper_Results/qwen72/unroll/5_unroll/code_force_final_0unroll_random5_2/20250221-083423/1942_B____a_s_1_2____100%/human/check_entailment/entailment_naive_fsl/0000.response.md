Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all positions.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
  - The program ensures that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix of `p` by updating it in each iteration.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program constructs `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true for each `i`.
  - By starting from the end and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and used to construct `p`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and permutation construction are robust to these values.

Since the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for every potential case and the provided logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
