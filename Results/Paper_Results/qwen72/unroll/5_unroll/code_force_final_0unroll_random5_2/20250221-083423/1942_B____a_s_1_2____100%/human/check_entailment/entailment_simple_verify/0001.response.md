### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX value for an array of length `i` is always a non-negative integer.
   - The relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` can be rearranged to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
   - To determine `p_i`, we need to know the MEX value of the array up to that point.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - It starts from the last element of `a` and works backwards to the first element.
   - At each step, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the current MEX value.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p_i`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - **Backward Construction:**
     - By working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX value is updated correctly for each `p_i` based on the elements that have already been determined.
     - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`.
     - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX value is always non-negative and the subtraction `mex - a[i]` will correctly produce a non-negative integer.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:**
       - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
       - `n = 5`
       - `mex = 5`
       - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
       - `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
       - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
       - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
       - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
       - `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
       - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
       - `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
       - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
       - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
       - The constructed permutation is `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
       - This matches the example output.
     - **Example 2:**
       - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
       - `n = 5`
       - `mex = 5`
       - `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`
       - `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
       - `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`
       - `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
       - `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`
       - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
       - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
       - `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
       - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
       - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
       - The constructed permutation is `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
       - This matches the example output.
     - **Example 3:**
       - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
       - `n = 3`
       - `mex = 3`
       - `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
       - `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
       - `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
       - `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
       - `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`
       - `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
       - The constructed permutation is `p = [2, 0, 1]`.
       - This matches the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The original assessment is accurate.
