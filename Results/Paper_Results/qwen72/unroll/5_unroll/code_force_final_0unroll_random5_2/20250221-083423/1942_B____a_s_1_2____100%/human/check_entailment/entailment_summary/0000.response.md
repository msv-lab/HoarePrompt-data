Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The approach taken by the program is to work backwards from the last element to the first, which is a valid strategy given the constraints and the nature of the \(\texttt{MEX}\) function.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of a permutation of length `n` (since the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of a permutation of length `n` is always between 0 and `n`).

2. **Backward Calculation**:
   - For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, the program calculates \( p_i = \texttt{mex} - a_i \).
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the permutation so far.

3. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and processes multiple test cases.
   - The backward calculation ensures that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is updated correctly and that the permutation `p` is constructed in a way that satisfies the given relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \)
   - For the second test case with `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1 \)
   - For the third test case with `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(2) - 2 = -2 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(2, 0) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2 \)

The program's logic and the examples provided confirm that it correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` that satisfies the given relationship for the array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
