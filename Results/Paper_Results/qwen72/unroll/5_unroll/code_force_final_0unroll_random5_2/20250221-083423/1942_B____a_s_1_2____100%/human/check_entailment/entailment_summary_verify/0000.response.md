### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all positions.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
  - The program starts with `mex` set to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.
  - As the program iterates backwards, it ensures that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix of `p` by updating it in each iteration.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program constructs `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true for each `i`.
  - By starting from the end and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and used to construct `p`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and permutation construction are robust to these values.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Correct MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX is calculated correctly by starting with `mex = n` and updating it to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration.
   - This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The backward iteration ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of `p` as the program constructs the permutation.
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`, which aligns with the given formula `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation `p` is constructed such that it satisfies the given array `a`.
   - The program ensures that each `p[i]` is a valid non-negative integer and that the MEX condition is met.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 1 -2 1 2`
  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
  - Calculation:
    - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
    - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
    - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - The constructed permutation `p` is `0 1 4 2 3`, which satisfies the given `a`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
  - Calculation:
    - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
    - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
    - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - The constructed permutation `p` is `0 1 2 3 4`, which satisfies the given `a`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3`, `-2 1 2`
  - Output: `2 0 1`
  - Calculation:
    - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
    - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
    - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
  - The constructed permutation `p` is `2 0 1`, which satisfies the given `a`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the steps taken by the program align with the problem description and the function summary. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
