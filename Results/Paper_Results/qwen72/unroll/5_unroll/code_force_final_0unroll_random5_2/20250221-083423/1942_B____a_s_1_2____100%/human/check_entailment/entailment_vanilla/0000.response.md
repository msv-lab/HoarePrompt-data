### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the above condition holds for each `a_i`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - For each `a_i`, we need to find `p_i` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - This implies that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - It starts from the last element of `a` and works backwards to the first element.
   - At each step, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the current MEX value.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p_i`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - By working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX value is updated correctly for each `p_i` based on the elements that have already been determined.
   - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX value is always non-negative and the subtraction `mex - a[i]` will correctly produce a non-negative integer.

6. **Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program:
     - For `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - For `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - For `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
