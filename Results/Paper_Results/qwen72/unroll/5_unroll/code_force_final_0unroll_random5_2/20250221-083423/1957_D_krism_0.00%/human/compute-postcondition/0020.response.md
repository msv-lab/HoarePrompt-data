To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `prefix` remains unchanged.
2. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
3. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains 0 and each sublist `[j][1]` contains 0.
4. `ans` is the sum of the products of:
   - The counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0.
   - The counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1.
   - This sum is taken for all j from 0 to 31.

### Explanation:
- `prefix` is a list that remains unchanged, so we assume it has some initial values.
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`.
- `ans` is calculated based on the bit counts of the elements in `prefix[1:n+1]`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31:
  - Count the number of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0.
  - Count the number of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1.
  - Multiply the count of elements with the j-th bit set to 0 by the initial count of elements with the j-th bit set to 0.
  - Multiply the count of elements with the j-th bit set to 1 by the initial count of elements with the j-th bit set to 1.
  - Sum these products for all bit positions from 0 to 31.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `prefix` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, plus the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, for all j from 0 to 31)**
