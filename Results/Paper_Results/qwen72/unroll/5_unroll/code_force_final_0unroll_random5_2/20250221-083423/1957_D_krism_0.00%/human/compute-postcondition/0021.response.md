The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function processes the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and returns a specific value based on the processing of these integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the processing of the integers in each test case.**
