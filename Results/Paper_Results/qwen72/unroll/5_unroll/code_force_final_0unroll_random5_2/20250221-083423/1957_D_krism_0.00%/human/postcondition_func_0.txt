The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr`, starting with 0, and stores these values in a list `prefix` of length `n + 1`. It then calculates the number of elements in `prefix` that have each bit (from 0 to 31) set to 0 and 1, updating two lists `pre` and `suf` accordingly. Finally, it computes a result `ans` based on the counts in `pre` and `suf` and prints `ans`. The function does not return any value. The variables `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the comments are not used in the function.
