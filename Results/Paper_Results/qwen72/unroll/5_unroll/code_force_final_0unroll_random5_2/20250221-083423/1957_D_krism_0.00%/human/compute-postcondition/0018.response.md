Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, and each sublist `[j][1]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, but these counts are now all zero, `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of elements with the j-th bit set to 0 and 1, for each j from 0 to 31, as calculated by the loop.
