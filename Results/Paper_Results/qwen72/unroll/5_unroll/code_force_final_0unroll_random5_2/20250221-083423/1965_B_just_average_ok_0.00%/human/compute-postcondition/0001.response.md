Output State: **The loop modifies the `nums` list and prints the length of the modified list followed by the elements of the list for each iteration. The variables `n` and `k` are read from input for each iteration and are not affected by the loop body. The state of `n` and `k` remains as integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.**

To break this down:
- For each iteration of the loop, `n` and `k` are read from input.
- The `nums` list is initialized with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
- The loop finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\).
- It then modifies the `nums` list by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).
- The modified `nums` list is printed, including its length and its elements.
- After the loop finishes, `n` and `k` retain their values as read from input, and `nums` is reset for the next iteration.

Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state for `n` and `k`, but the `nums` list is modified and printed for each iteration.
