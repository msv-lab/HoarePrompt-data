Output State: **The program returns the list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order.** 

Here, `arr` is a list that is either `a` or `b` (since the variable `arr` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be one of the lists `a` or `b`). Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and each element in `a` and `b` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`. The returned list will have the same elements as `arr`, but in descending order.
