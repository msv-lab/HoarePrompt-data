### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of new problems to be proposed such that after each insertion and sorting, the difficulty of each problem in the array `a` is less than or equal to the corresponding difficulty in the array `b`.
   - Both arrays `a` and `b` are initially sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - For each new problem proposed with difficulty `w`, the most difficult problem in `a` is removed, and the array is sorted again.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current difficulties, and the array `b` of expected difficulties.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero, which will keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - The while loop continues until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult. The program then:
       - Removes the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem).
       - Inserts `b[j]` into `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
       - Increments the counter `cnt` and the pointer `j`.
     - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is acceptable, and both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented.
   - Finally, the program prints the counter `cnt` for each test case.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main program. It sorts a list in non-increasing order, but this function is not called or relevant to the main logic.
   - The main logic of the program is to ensure that after each insertion and removal, the array `a` is in non-decreasing order and meets the condition `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the insertion and removal of elements to ensure that the array `a` is always in non-decreasing order.
   - The logic of comparing `b[j]` with `a[i]` and adjusting the arrays accordingly is correct.
   - The program correctly counts the number of new problems proposed and prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the way the array `a` is modified. The line `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` is inefficient and can be optimized. Instead of creating a new list, the program should maintain the sorted order by inserting the new element at the correct position and removing the last element.

### Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. The inefficiency in list manipulation does not affect the correctness of the solution, but it could be optimized for better performance.
