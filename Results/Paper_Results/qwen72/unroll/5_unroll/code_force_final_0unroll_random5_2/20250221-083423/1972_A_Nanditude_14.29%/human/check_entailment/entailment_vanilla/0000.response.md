Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - The condition `while i < n and j < n` ensures that the loop runs as long as there are elements to compare in both arrays.

4. **Comparison and Insertion**:
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult, so the program:
     - Pops the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem).
     - Inserts `b[j]` into `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
     - Increments the counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
     - Increments `j` to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so the program:
     - Increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next problem in both arrays.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies when a problem is too difficult and proposes a new problem with the appropriate difficulty.
   - The insertion and popping operations ensure that the array `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The loop continues until all problems are within the expected difficulty.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (no new problems needed).
   - It also handles the case where `a` is more difficult than `b` for some elements, requiring the insertion of new problems.

9. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) because the operations inside the loop are linear in complexity.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
