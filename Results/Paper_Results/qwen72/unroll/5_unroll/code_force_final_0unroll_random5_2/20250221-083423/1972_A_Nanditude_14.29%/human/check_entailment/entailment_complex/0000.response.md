Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the list of current difficulties `a`, and the list of expected difficulties `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `cnt` (the count of new problems needed) to 0, and two pointers `i` and `j` to 0. These pointers are used to traverse the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the lists `a` and `b`:
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is more difficult than expected. The program then:
     - Removes the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem).
     - Inserts `b[j]` into `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
     - Increments `cnt` to account for the new problem proposed.
     - Increments `j` to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is within the expected difficulty. The program then:
     - Increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next problem in both lists.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the count of new problems needed for each test case.

5. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program. It is defined to sort a list in non-increasing order, but it is not called anywhere in the program. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a problem in `a` is more difficult than the corresponding problem in `b`.
   - It correctly removes the most difficult problem and inserts the new problem to maintain the non-decreasing order.
   - The program ensures that the number of new problems proposed is minimized by always inserting the new problem at the correct position and removing the most difficult one.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (no new problems needed).
   - The program handles the case where all problems in `a` are more difficult than the corresponding problems in `b` (all problems need to be replaced).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
