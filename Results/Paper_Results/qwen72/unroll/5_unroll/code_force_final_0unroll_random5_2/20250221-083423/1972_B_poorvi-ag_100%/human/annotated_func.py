#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, depending on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for that test case is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, and the variable `t` remains unchanged. The loop prints each element in the `results` list, one by one, to the console. Each element printed will be either 'yes' or 'no' based on the initial state of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd, appending 'yes' to a results list if true, and 'no' if false. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list to the console, one by one. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
