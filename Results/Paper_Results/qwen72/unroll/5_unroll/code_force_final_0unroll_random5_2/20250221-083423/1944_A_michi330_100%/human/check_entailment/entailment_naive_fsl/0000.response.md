Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still large enough to isolate some islands. For example, consider the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \). According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit. The optimal strategy would be to isolate one island by removing the 3 bridges connected to it, leaving Everule with 4 islands to visit. However, the program will output 5, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should consider the number of bridges that can be destroyed to isolate the maximum number of islands. The correct logic would be to check if \( k \) is enough to isolate at least one island, and if so, calculate the minimum number of islands that can still be visited. The correct solution would be:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of islands that can still be visited
            print(n - k // (n - 1))

func()
```

This solution correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit is calculated correctly.
