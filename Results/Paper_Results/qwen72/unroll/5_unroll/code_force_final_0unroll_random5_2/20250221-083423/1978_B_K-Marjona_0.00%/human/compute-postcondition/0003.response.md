Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function calculates a value based on the conditions provided and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed. The input values `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are read from input for each test case. **
