You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a single integer indicating the optimal position of the dividing line between the left and right sides of the street to satisfy the residents' preferences as much as possible. The variables `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will have been updated to reflect the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the street for the last test case processed. The variables `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` will have been reset for each test case, and their final values will be the result of the last test case's computations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It initializes several variables to keep track of the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road.

2. **Initial Counting:**
   - The program splits the string `s` into two halves: the first half (from index 0 to `mid - 1`) and the second half (from index `mid` to `n - 1`).
   - It counts the number of zeros and ones in each half and stores these counts in `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne`.
   - It also maintains total counts of zeros and ones in `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne`.

3. **Left Side Adjustment:**
   - The program then iterates from the middle to the beginning of the string, adjusting the counts of zeros and ones on the left and right sides.
   - It decrements the count of zeros or ones on the left side and increments the count on the right side as it moves the road to the left.
   - The loop continues until the road can be placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

4. **Right Side Adjustment:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates from the middle to the end of the string, adjusting the counts of zeros and ones on the left and right sides.
   - It increments the count of zeros or ones on the left side and decrements the count on the right side as it moves the road to the right.
   - The loop continues until the road can be placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - After the adjustments, the program checks the final positions of the road (`left` and `right`).
   - It determines the optimal position by comparing the distances from the middle of the village to the `left` and `right` positions.
   - If the road can be placed before the first house (`left == 0`), it checks if the right side condition is met and prints the appropriate position.
   - If the road can be placed after the last house (`right == n`), it checks if the left side condition is met and prints the appropriate position.
   - If both positions are valid, it prints the one that is closer to the middle of the village.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly counts the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road.
- It adjusts the road position to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The final decision logic ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible, while still meeting the satisfaction condition.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description and constraints accurately.
- It handles edge cases (road before the first house and after the last house) correctly.
- The logic for adjusting the road position and making the final decision is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
