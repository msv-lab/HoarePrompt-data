Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of sticks, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from the user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function calculates the number of complete sets of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed count of such sets, while the variables `n`, `a`, and the internal dictionary `cnt` used for counting are no longer accessible outside the function. **
