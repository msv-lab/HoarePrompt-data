You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in each test case, and a list of lists a where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 100. `n` remains the same input integer. `a` remains the same list of integers input by the user. `ans` remains 0.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3, while `cnt`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each value in cnt by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (a list of the number of sticks in each test case), and `a` (a list of lists containing the lengths of the sticks for each test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if it is possible to form a square using the sticks in the corresponding test case, and "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
