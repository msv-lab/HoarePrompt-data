The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` reordered based on their depth in the parentheses structure. Specifically, `ans` will contain the characters from `s` such that characters at the same depth are grouped together and appear in the order of their depths from the shallowest to the deepest. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a string representing the characters from `s` reordered by their depth.
