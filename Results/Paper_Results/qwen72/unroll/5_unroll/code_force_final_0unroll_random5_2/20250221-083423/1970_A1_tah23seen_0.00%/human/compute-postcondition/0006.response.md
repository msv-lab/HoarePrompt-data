Output State: **`ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`, `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at position `i` in the string `s`.** 

The key `n` has been removed from the dictionary `d`, but the other values in `d` and the state of `ans` remain unchanged.
