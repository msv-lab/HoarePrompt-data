The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(f'13 0')
```

Let's break down the initial state and the code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\), and each element \(a_i\) in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
  - `m` is 0.
  - `c` is not equal to 2 (which is a bit ambiguous since `c` is a list, but it implies that the list `c` does not contain the value 2).

- **Code Snippet**:
  - The `print` statement is using an f-string to format the output.
  - The f-string contains the literal values '13' and '0'.
  - These values are not dependent on any variables or conditions in the initial state.

Given that the f-string is simply printing the literal values '13' and '0', the output will be exactly as specified in the string.

Output: **13 0**
