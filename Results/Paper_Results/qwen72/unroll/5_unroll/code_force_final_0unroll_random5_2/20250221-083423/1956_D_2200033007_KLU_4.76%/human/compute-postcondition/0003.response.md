Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- Each element \(a_i\) in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

Given the initial state, the value of `c` is described as 2, which is a bit ambiguous because `c` is supposed to be a list. However, if we interpret this as the list `c` containing a single element, which is 2, then `c` can be represented as `[2]`.

The code snippet:
```
print(f'1 2')
```

This `print` statement is a formatted string that explicitly prints the values '1' and '2' separated by a space. The values '1' and '2' are not variables or objects from the initial state; they are hardcoded strings within the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1 2**
