### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order (i.e., `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`).
   - If an out-of-order element is found and it is greater than 10, the program splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing the array, it checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only splits the element if it is out of order and greater than 10. However, it should split any element greater than or equal to 10, regardless of its position relative to the next element.
   - **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes a single pass through the array, which means it might not fully process all elements that need to be split. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` but will not split `45` or `67` in the same pass.
   - **Incorrect Insertion Position**: The program inserts the digits of the split element at the same position, which might not always result in a sorted array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, splitting `12` results in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the array is still not sorted.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to split all elements greater than or equal to 10 in a separate loop and then check if the resulting array is sorted.
   - Alternatively, a recursive or iterative approach could be used to ensure that all elements are split until no more splits are needed, and then check if the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical flaws and does not correctly handle the splitting of elements or ensure that the array is fully processed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
