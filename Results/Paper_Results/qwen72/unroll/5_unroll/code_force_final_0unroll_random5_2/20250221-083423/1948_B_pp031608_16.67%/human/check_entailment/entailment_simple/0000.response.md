### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if it is possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the array is not already sorted (`not func_1(list1)`), it checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)` and prints 'Yes' if it is, otherwise 'No'.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - If `lst` is already sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program only attempts to split elements once in a single pass through the array. This is insufficient because multiple passes may be required to fully sort the array.
   - The program does not handle cases where the array might need to be split multiple times to achieve a sorted order.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of elements being split and still not achieving a sorted order.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Input: `4\n12 3 45 67`
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Actual Output: `YES`
     - Reason: The array can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` which is sorted.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Input: `3\n12 28 5`
     - Expected Output: `NO`
     - Actual Output: `NO`
     - Reason: No matter how many times you split the elements, the array cannot be sorted.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Input: `2\n0 0`
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Actual Output: `YES`
     - Reason: The array is already sorted.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
