The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function returns `False` if `lst` is not already sorted in ascending order, and `True` if `lst` is already sorted in ascending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99, and the list length between 2 and 50) and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`.**
