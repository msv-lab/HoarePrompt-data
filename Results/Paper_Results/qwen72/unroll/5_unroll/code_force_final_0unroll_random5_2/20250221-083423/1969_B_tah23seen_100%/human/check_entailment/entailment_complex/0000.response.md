### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1(s)`.
   - The function `func_1` is expected to return the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.
   - Finally, it returns the `cost`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function aims to calculate the cost of making the string sorted by cyclically shifting substrings.
   - The cost is incremented by `one + 1` for each '0' that follows a '1'. This is because each '0' that follows a '1' indicates a potential cyclic shift of a substring that includes the '1' and the '0'.
   - The logic correctly identifies the number of '1's and the positions of '0's that follow '1's, which is a key part of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's but is already sorted (e.g., "0011"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's and is not sorted (e.g., "101011"), the function correctly calculates the cost.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly returns 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly returns 11.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly solved by the function.

Correctness: **True**
