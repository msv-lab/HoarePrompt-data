The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a list of weighted edges, sorts these edges in descending order by weight, and then uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to process these edges. It finds the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned and identifies the nodes involved in this union. The function then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of these nodes and prints the minimum edge weight, the length of the path found by the DFS, and the nodes visited during the DFS. The function does not return any value but modifies the `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` structures during its execution. The final state of the program includes the sorted `edges` list, the modified `graph` and `dsu` structures, and the printed results.
