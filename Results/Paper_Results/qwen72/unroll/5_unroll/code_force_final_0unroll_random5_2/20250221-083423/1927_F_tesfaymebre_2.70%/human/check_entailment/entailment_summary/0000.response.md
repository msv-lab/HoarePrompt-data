Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases using `func_1` and then processing each test case using `func_6` in `func_7`.

2. **Graph Construction**: In `func_6`, the graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, and the edges are stored in a list of tuples. This is a standard and efficient way to represent a graph and its edges.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is a crucial step because the program aims to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. By processing the edges in descending order, the program ensures that it tries to form cycles with the heaviest edges first, which helps in identifying the lightest edge in the cycle.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**: The DSU data structure is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing of vertices. This is correct and necessary for the union-find operations.

5. **Cycle Detection and Union**: The program uses the DSU to detect cycles. If two vertices `u` and `v` are already in the same set (i.e., they have the same parent), it means a cycle has been detected. The program then updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle. If the vertices are not in the same set, they are unioned.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**: After identifying a cycle, the program uses a DFS to traverse the cycle and collect the vertices. The DFS function `dfs` correctly marks vertices as visited and fully processed, and it returns the path when a cycle is detected.

7. **Output**: The program prints the minimum edge weight, the length of the cycle, and the vertices in the cycle. This matches the required output format.

However, there is a logical issue in the cycle detection and union part of `func_6`:
- The program should be unioning the vertices only if they are not already in the same set. The current implementation incorrectly unions the vertices even if they are in the same set, which can lead to incorrect cycle detection.

Here is the corrected part of `func_6`:
```python
for (w, u, v) in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u != parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
    else:
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
```

With this correction, the program should correctly identify the simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

Correctness: **False**

The program as provided has a logical error in the cycle detection and union part, which can lead to incorrect results. The correction mentioned above is necessary to ensure the program meets the problem description.
