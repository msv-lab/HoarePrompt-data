n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5), and edges is a list of m tuples, each containing three integers (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, and it is guaranteed that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph.
