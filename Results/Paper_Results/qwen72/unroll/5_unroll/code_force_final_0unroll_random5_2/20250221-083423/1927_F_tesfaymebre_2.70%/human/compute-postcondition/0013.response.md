Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `edges` is a sorted list of `m` tuples in descending order where each tuple is of the form `(w, u, v)` as returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of values `v` that were appended during the loop iterations, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1` and modified by the union operations, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned, `node_u` is the node involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight, `node_v` is the other node involved in the same union operation, `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all zeros, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call starting from `node_u` with a parent of `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.**
