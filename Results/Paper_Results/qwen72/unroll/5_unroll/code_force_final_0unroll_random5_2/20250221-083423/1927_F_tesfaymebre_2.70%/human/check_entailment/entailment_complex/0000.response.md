Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the number of test cases and other lines of input, respectively. These functions are simple and correctly handle the input format.

2. **Graph Construction and Edge Sorting**:
   - `func_6` reads the graph and constructs a list of edges sorted in descending order by weight. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are processed first, which is a reasonable approach to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Usage**:
   - The DSU data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph. The `union` function correctly updates the parent and size of the sets, and it also updates the minimum edge weight for each set.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function `func_6` attempts to find a cycle by processing the edges in descending order. If an edge connects two nodes that are already in the same set, it means a cycle is detected. The function then updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual cycle. It performs a DFS starting from one of the nodes involved in the cycle detected by the DSU. The function correctly marks nodes as visited and backtracks when necessary to find the cycle.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight, the length of the cycle, and the nodes in the cycle. This matches the required output format.

7. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_7` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case. This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum edge weight is flawed. The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to ensure that the edge is not already part of the same component before performing the union. The current logic will incorrectly union nodes that are already connected, which can lead to incorrect cycle detection.

- **DFS Initialization**:
  - The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` and `node_v` which are supposed to be part of the cycle. However, the `dfs` function is not properly initialized to start from `node_u` and find the cycle involving `node_v`. The `dfs` function should be called with `node_u` and `node_v` as parameters to ensure it finds the correct cycle.

- **Cycle Path Return**:
  - The `dfs` function should return the path from `node_u` to `node_v` and back to `node_u` to form the cycle. The current implementation may not always return the correct cycle path.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
