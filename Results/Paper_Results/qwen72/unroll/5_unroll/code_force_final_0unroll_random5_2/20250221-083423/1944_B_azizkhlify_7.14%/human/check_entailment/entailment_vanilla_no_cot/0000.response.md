Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Array Initialization and Usage**: The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to have a length of `n`, but they should be used to store the counts of elements in the first and second halves of the input array `a`. However, the program incorrectly uses these arrays to store counts and then tries to print elements directly from `a` based on these counts, which leads to incorrect output.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Subsets**: The program attempts to construct the subsets `l` and `r` by counting occurrences of elements in the first and second halves of `a`. However, it does not correctly ensure that the subsets are of length `2k` and that their bitwise XORs are equal.

3. **Output Issues**: The program prints elements directly without ensuring that the subsets `l` and `r` are of the correct length and without verifying that their bitwise XORs are equal. This can lead to incorrect or incomplete output.

4. **Handling of `ul` and `ur`**: The variables `ul` and `ur` are used to track the number of elements added to the subsets, but the logic for updating and checking these variables is flawed, leading to potential mismatches in the lengths of the subsets.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Identify the elements in the first half and the second half of the array.
- Construct subsets `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that their bitwise XORs are equal.
- Ensure that the subsets are valid and meet the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = [int(data[idx + i]) for i in range(2 * n)]
        idx += 2 * n
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of each element
        indices = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        for i in range(2 * n):
            indices[a[i]].append(i)
        
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # First, try to pair elements from the first half with elements from the second half
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if len(indices[i]) == 2:
                if indices[i][0] < n and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    l.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    r.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    if len(l) == k:
                        break
                elif indices[i][0] >= n and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    r.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    if len(l) == k:
                        break
        
        # If we haven't filled l and r yet, we need to find additional pairs
        if len(l) < k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if len(indices[i]) == 2 and indices[i][0] < n and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    l.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    if len(l) == 2 * k:
                        break
                elif len(indices[i]) == 2 and indices[i][0] >= n and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    r.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    r.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    if len(r) == 2 * k:
                        break
        
        # Ensure both l and r are of length 2k
        while len(l) < 2 * k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if len(indices[i]) == 2 and indices[i][0] < n and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    l.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    if len(l) == 2 * k:
                        break
        while len(r) < 2 * k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if len(indices[i]) == 2 and indices[i][0] >= n and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    r.append(a[indices[i][0]])
                    r.append(a[indices[i][1]])
                    if len(r) == 2 * k:
                        break
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, r)))
    
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that their bitwise XORs are equal. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the indices of each element and constructs the subsets accordingly.
