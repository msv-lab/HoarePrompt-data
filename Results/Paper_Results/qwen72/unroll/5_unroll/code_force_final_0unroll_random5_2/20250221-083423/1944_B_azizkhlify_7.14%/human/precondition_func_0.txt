The function `func` is not properly defined in the context of the problem. The correct function definition should be `def find_subarrays(a, n, k):` where `a` is a list of integers of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
