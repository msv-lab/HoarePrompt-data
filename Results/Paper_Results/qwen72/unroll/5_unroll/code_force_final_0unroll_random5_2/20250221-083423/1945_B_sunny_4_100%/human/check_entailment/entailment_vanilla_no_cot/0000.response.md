Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the overlap of visibility times between fireworks launched by the two installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time, considering the visibility overlap. This involves finding the time when the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within m minutes
        fireworks_a = m // a + 1
        fireworks_b = m // b + 1
        # Calculate the number of overlapping times within m minutes
        overlapping_times = m // lcm(a, b) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks seen at the same time is the sum of the fireworks
        # launched by each installation minus the overlapping times plus 1 (for the initial overlap)
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlapping_times
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to find the overlapping times and then calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the overlaps.
