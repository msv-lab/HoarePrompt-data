The only variables in the loop head are `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `qi` is the loop index and should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `qi` is 0**
