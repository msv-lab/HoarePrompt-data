Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` from user input. It then generates a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is always 500, and for each subsequent index `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n), `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]`, added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. **
