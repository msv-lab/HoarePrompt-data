#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: The value of `l` will be 'NO' after the loop executes all iterations, assuming the input provided for each test case does not meet the condition where `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]` for any index `i`. The value of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if, for every index `i` (0 ≤ i < n), either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all indices, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case did not meet the condition, and `t` will remain unchanged.
