Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.**

Given the problem description, the correct function definition should be:
```
def func(t, X):
```

However, since the function definition provided does not match the problem description, the precondition cannot be accurately stated based on the provided function definition alone. The precondition is more accurately described based on the problem's input requirements.
