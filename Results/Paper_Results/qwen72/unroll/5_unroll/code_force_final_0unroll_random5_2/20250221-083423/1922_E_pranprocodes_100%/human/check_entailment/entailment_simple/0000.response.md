### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. However, the function reads the number of test cases and the value of `X` for each test case from the standard input, which is a common practice in competitive programming.
   - The function correctly processes each test case by reading `X` and generating an array `ans` that should have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The algorithm uses a loop to reduce `X` to 1 by either dividing `X` by 2 (if `X` is even) or subtracting 1 from `X` (if `X` is odd).
   - For each even `X`, it appends the current maximum value to `ans` and decreases `max` by 1, effectively adding a new element that can be part of multiple increasing subsequences.
   - For each odd `X`, it appends the current minimum value to `ans` and increases `min` by 1, effectively adding a new element that can only be part of a single increasing subsequence.
   - The loop continues until `X` is reduced to 1, and the array `ans` is reversed before printing.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The function prints the length of the array `t` and then the array `ans` itself.
   - The array `ans` is generated such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which is the intended behavior.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function does not handle the case where no such array exists, which is required by the problem statement. According to the problem, if it is impossible to find the required array, the function should print `-1`. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition and always prints an array.
   - The function does not ensure that the length of the array `ans` is at most 200. If `X` is very large, the array could exceed this limit, which would make the solution incorrect.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm is designed to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences by manipulating the values of `max` and `min` and appending them to `ans` based on the parity of `X`.
   - However, the algorithm does not account for the possibility that `X` might be such that no valid array of length at most 200 can be generated. For example, if `X` is a very large prime number, the algorithm might generate an array that is too long.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where no valid array exists, and it does not ensure that the generated array is of length at most 200. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
