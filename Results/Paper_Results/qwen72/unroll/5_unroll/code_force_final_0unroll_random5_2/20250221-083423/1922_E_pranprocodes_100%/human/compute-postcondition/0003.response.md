Functionality: ** The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `X`. It then generates an array of integers `ans` of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If such an array can be generated, it prints the length of the array `t` and the array itself. If no such array can be generated, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program includes the processed test cases and the generated arrays or `-1` for each test case. **
