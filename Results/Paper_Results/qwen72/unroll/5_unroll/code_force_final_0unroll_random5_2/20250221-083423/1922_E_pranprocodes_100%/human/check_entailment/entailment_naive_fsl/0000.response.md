Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for certain values of X. For example, consider the input X = 13. The program generates the array `[-100000000, -99999999, 99999999, 99999998, 99999997, 99999996, 99999995]`. However, this array does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in this array is much larger due to the presence of multiple large positive numbers and negative numbers, which can form many different increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
