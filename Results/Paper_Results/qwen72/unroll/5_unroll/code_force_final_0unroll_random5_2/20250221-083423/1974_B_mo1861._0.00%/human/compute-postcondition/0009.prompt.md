You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in the string `b` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the characters are sorted in ascending order and mapped to letters starting from the end of the alphabet. The length of `b` remains unchanged.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string containing the concatenated lowercase letters corresponding to each character in `b` as per the mapping in `char_map`. `char_map` remains unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` which contains the concatenated lowercase letters corresponding to each character in `b` as per the mapping in `char_map`. `char_map` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` formed by concatenating the lowercase letters corresponding to each character in `b` as per the mapping in `char_map`. The `char_map` remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` which contains the concatenated lowercase letters corresponding to each character in `b` as per the mapping in `char_map`. `char_map` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
