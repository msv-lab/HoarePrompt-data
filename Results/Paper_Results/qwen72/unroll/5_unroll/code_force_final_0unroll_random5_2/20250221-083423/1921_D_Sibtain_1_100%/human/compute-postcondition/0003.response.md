Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c` after applying a specific logic. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, it prints 0. If `a` has only one element, it prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the elements in `c`. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c` between test cases. **
