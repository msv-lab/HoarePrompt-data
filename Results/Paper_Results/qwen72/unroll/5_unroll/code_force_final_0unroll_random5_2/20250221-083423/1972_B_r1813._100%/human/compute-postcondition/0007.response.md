Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it checks if the number of 'U' characters in a given string is odd. If the number is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `t` variable remains unchanged, and `index` is set to `t * 2 + 1`. The `n` and `s` variables are set to the last values read from the input, and `count_u` is set to the count of 'U' in the last `s` string. **
