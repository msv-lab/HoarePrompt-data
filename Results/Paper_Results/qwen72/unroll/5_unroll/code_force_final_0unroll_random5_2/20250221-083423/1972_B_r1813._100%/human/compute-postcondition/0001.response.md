Output State: **The function still takes two parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins. The `input` variable is now set to the `sys.stdin.read` function. The `data` variable is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input read from `sys.stdin` and split by whitespace.**

Explanation:
- The `input` variable is set to `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input.
- The `input().split()` function call reads the input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace.
- The `data` variable now holds this list of strings.
- The initial parameters `n` and `s` remain unchanged and still represent the number of coins and the initial state of the coins, respectively.
