The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins, and it must be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The string `s` has a length equal to `n` and contains only the characters "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.

The function returns the number of coins that need to be flipped to make all coins face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns the minimum number of coin flips required to make all coins face the same direction.**
