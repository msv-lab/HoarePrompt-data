The only objects in the loop head are variables `y`, `x`, and the range defined by `x - 1` and `1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that the starting value of the range, `x - 1`, must be greater than the ending value, `1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000
- `max_val` is 1

To ensure the loop executes:
- `x - 1` must be greater than `1`, which means `x` must be greater than `2`.

Since `max_val` is not used in the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`, `max_val` is 1**
