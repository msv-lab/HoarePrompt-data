### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1, or 1 if no such divisor exists.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Divisor Check**: The function correctly checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - **Maximization Condition**: The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a good candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( y \) if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - **Largest Divisor**: If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1. This is a reasonable fallback because the GCD will be the largest possible divisor, and adding \( y \) to it will still maximize the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.
   - For prime \( x \), the only divisor less than \( x \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.
   - For composite \( x \), the function will find the largest divisor that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1, which is a valid and optimal solution.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) is 5, and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the only divisor less than 7 is 1, and \( \gcd(7, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) is 18, and \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) is 98, and \( \gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) is 750, and \( \gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 250 + 750 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) is 3, and \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.
