### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be made sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix. This involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Split Point**: Find the first index `i` where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Check the Suffix and Prefix**: Ensure that the suffix (from `i + 1` to the end) and the prefix (from the beginning to `i`) are both non-decreasing.
3. **Check the Concatenation**: Ensure that the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform these checks. It only returns "Yes" if the array is already sorted and "No" otherwise, which is incorrect for the given problem.

### Example Test Case:

Consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
5
3 1 2 4 5
```

- **Initial Array**: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
- **First Split Point**: `i = 0` (since `3 > 1`)
- **Suffix**: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
- **Prefix**: `[3]`
- **After First Swap**: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`
- **Second Split Point**: `i = 4` (since `5 > 3`)
- **Suffix**: `[3]`
- **Prefix**: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
- **After Second Swap**: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`

The array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operations, but `func_1` will return "No" because it does not consider the possibility of making the array sorted through these operations.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation of `func_1` would involve the following logic:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the first split point where the array is not sorted
    i = 0
    while i < n - 1 and arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    
    # If no split point is found, the array is already sorted
    if i == n - 1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the second split point where the array is not sorted
    j = n - 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] >= arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    
    # If the second split point is the same as the first split point, the array can be made sorted
    if i == j - 1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if the suffix and prefix are non-decreasing
    if all(arr[k] <= arr[k + 1] for k in range(i + 1, j - 1)) and all(arr[k] <= arr[k + 1] for k in range(j, n - 1)):
        # Check if the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix
        if arr[j - 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the necessary logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.

Final: **False**
