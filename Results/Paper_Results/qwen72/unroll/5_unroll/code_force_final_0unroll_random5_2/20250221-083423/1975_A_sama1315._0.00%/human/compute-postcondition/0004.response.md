Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings containing the input values split by whitespace, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1.** 

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
