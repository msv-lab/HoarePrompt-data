### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. It only checks the initial state of the array.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` on the array and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, one per line.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem as it only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.
   - To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if there exists a split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that:
     - The suffix is non-decreasing.
     - The prefix is non-decreasing.
     - The last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.
   - Since `func_1` does not perform this check, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
