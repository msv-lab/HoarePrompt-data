To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is the last integer value read from `data` for the final iteration.
- `arr` is the last list of integers created from `data` for the final iteration.
- `data` is unchanged.
- `input` is the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- `index` is the index after the last element of `data` used in the loop.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `results`:**
   - `results` is a list that contains the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.
   - Each element in `results` is the output of `func_1(arr)` for a specific iteration.

2. **Understanding `func_1(arr)`:**
   - `func_1(arr)` is a function that processes the list `arr` and returns some result.
   - The exact output of `func_1(arr)` is not provided, but we know it is called for each iteration and the results are stored in the `results` list.

3. **Understanding the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses `'\n'.join(results)` to join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each result from `func_1(arr)` will be printed on a new line.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will print each result from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, with each result on a new line.
- Since the exact values of `func_1(arr)` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the results stored in `results`.

Output: **[result1]
[result2]
...
[resultN] (where each [resultX] is the result of `func_1(arr)` for the corresponding iteration)**
