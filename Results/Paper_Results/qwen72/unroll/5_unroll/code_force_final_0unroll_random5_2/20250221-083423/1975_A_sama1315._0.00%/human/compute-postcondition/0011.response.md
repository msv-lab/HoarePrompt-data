Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of integer data, and applies `func_1` to each set of integers. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each set, one result per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `data` list remains unchanged, and `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each iteration. **
