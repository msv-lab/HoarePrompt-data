### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. This operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already non-decreasing.
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not non-decreasing, it returns 'No' if there exists any pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of making the array non-decreasing by performing the swap operation, which is a crucial part of the problem.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly reads the array elements and calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - It does not implement the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the swap operation.
   - Therefore, `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the swap operation, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be split into two parts, and when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing.
   - This can be done by finding the point where the array first becomes non-decreasing and checking if the remaining part can be appended to the beginning to form a non-decreasing array.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_1` only checks if the array is already non-decreasing, which is insufficient for the problem. The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the swap operation, and this is not addressed in the given function. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
