#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs a single integer value that represents the position of the k-th element in the sequence generated by the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are input values, and the loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer value that represents the position of the k-th element in a specific sequence derived from `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case.
