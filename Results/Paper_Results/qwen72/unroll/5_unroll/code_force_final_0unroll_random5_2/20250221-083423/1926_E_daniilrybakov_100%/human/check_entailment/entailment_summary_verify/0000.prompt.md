You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer value that represents the position of the k-th element in a specific sequence derived from `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the process of laying down cards in the specified order, and it correctly calculates the position of the k-th card laid down. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. **Finding the Correct Multiplier**:
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
   - It calculates the number of cards `x` that will be laid down in the current step using `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It updates `n` to `n // 2` to move to the next step.
   - It checks if the k-th card falls within the current step by comparing `s` and `s + x`.
   - If the k-th card is within the current step, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `s` and `m` to move to the next step.
4. **Calculating the k-th Card**:
   - Once the correct step is found, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. For example:
- When `n` is 1, it correctly returns 1.
- When `n` is 7 and `k` ranges from 1 to 7, it correctly returns the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
- For larger values of `n` and `k`, it correctly identifies the k-th card laid down.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
