Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem as described. It only checks if the difference between the sum of the elements and the last element is zero, which is not a valid approach to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

A specific example where the program fails is:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the difference between the sum of the elements and the last element, which in this case is zero. However, it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations, as the only way to balance the water would be to pour from the third container to the first, which is not allowed (i.e., i must be less than j).
