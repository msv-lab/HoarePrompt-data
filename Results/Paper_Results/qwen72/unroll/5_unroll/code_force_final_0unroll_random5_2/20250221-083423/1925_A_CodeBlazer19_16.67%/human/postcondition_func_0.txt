The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`. It then constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `2` times if `n` is greater than 1, and `1` time if `n` is 1. The function does not return any value.
