Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times m \) grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares.
   - We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first row and the last row of the grid are already the same color, or if the first column and the last column of the grid are already the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If the first row and the last row are different colors, or if the first column and the last column are different colors, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and constructs a list of strings `a` representing the grid.
   - It also constructs two strings: `first_row` (the first character of each row) and `last_row` (the last character of each row).
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If the first row and the last row are the same color but different from each other.
     - If the first column and the last column are the same color but different from each other.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The conditions checked by the program are not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - The program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, but it does not consider the entire grid.
   - A counterexample to the program's logic is a grid where the first and last rows are different colors, but the rest of the grid can still be made the same color. For instance, consider the following grid:
     ```
     3 3
     WBB
     BBB
     BBB
     ```
     - The first row is 'WBB' and the last row is 'BBB'. The first character of the first row is 'W' and the first character of the last row is 'B', which are different.
     - The last character of the first row is 'B' and the last character of the last row is 'B', which are the same.
     - The program will print 'NO' because the first row and the last row are different colors.
     - However, it is possible to make the entire grid 'B' by selecting the subrectangle from (1,2) to (3,3) and coloring it 'B'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n \) or \( m \) is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is already the same color correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
