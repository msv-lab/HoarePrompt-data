Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an n Ã— m grid the same color after performing a series of operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The function checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are both uniform (i.e., contain only one unique character) and if they are different colors.
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column and the last column of the grid are both uniform and if they are different colors.

3. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Analysis:
- **Uniform Rows and Columns**:
  - If the first row and the last row are both uniform but different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and the first and last rows would always remain different.
  - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different colors, the same logic applies.

- **General Case**:
  - If the grid does not have the above specific conditions, it is generally possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation can be used to gradually expand the uniform color regions until the entire grid is the same color.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Row or Column**:
  - If `n` or `m` is 1, the grid is a single row or column, and the function correctly handles this by checking the uniformity of the first and last rows or columns.
- **Uniform Grid**:
  - If the entire grid is already uniform, the function correctly prints "YES".

### Potential Issues:
- **First and Last Columns**:
  - The function does not explicitly check the first and last columns for uniformity. Instead, it checks the first and last characters of each row to form `first_row` and `last_row`. This is a valid approach because if the first and last characters of each row are the same, the first and last columns will also be uniform.
- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The function correctly resets the variables for each test case, ensuring that the state of one test case does not affect the next.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color based on the given problem description and constraints. The conditions for "NO" are correctly identified, and the function prints "YES" for all other cases.

Correctness: **True**
