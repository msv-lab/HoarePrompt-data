Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility that the grid can be made uniform even if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are not initially uniform. The logic in the program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, but it does not consider the entire grid.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```
The program will print "NO" because the first and last rows are not the same, and the first and last columns are not the same. However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B') and coloring the entire grid 'B'. This is a valid operation according to the problem description, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
