Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times m \) grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares.
   - We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first row and the last row of the grid are already the same color, or if the first column and the last column of the grid are already the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If the first row and the last row are different colors, or if the first column and the last column are different colors, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and constructs a list of strings `a` representing the grid.
   - It also constructs two strings: `first_row` (the first character of each row) and `last_row` (the last character of each row).
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If the first row and the last row are the same color but different from each other.
     - If the first column and the last column are the same color but different from each other.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The conditions checked by the program are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If the first row and the last row are the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the subrectangle operations cannot change the color of the entire grid to a single color if the first and last rows are different.
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n \) or \( m \) is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is already the same color correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
