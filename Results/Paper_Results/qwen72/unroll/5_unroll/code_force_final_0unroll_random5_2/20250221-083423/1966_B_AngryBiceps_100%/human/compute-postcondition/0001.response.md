Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the dimensions and the grid, and checks the conditions for the first and last rows and columns. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.**
