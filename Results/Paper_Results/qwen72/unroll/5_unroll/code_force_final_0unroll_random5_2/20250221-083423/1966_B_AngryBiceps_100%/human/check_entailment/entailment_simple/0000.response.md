### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The program checks the following conditions to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color:
1. **First and Last Rows Check**: If the first row and the last row are both entirely one color (either all 'W' or all 'B'), but they are different colors from each other, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first and last rows would form a boundary that cannot be bridged by any operation.
2. **First and Last Columns Check**: Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both entirely one color, but they are different colors from each other, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason as above.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program assumes it is possible to make the entire grid the same color and prints 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **First and Last Rows Check**: This condition is valid because if the first and last rows are entirely different colors, no operation can change the color of the entire grid to a single color.
- **First and Last Columns Check**: This condition is also valid for the same reason as the rows.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where the grid is a single row or a single column. However, for a single row or column, the conditions will still correctly identify if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color.
- **General Case**: The program assumes that if the first and last rows or columns are not entirely different colors, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This assumption is correct because if there is at least one common color in the first and last rows or columns, it is always possible to use operations to make the entire grid that color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. For all other cases, it correctly prints 'YES'. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
