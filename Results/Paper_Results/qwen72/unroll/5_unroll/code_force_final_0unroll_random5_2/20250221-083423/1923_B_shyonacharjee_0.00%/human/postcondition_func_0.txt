The function `func_1` reads `t` test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of `n` and `k` integers, followed by two lists: `healths` and `positions`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters by sorting them based on their absolute positions and checking if the total number of bullets needed to defeat them does not exceed the time available, which is the distance of the monster from the origin. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the constraints, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t` and `cases` (if present) are not modified by the function.
