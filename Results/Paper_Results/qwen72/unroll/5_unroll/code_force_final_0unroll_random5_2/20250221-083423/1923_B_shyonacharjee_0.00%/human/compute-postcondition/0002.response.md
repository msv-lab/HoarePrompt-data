Output State: **The variable `t` is unchanged, and the list `cases` is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop reads the values of `n` and `k`, the list `healths`, and the list `positions`. It then sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the given constraints. The result for each test case is printed as 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, or 'NO' otherwise. The variables `total_bullets_used` and `success` are reset for each test case, and their final values are not retained after the loop.**
