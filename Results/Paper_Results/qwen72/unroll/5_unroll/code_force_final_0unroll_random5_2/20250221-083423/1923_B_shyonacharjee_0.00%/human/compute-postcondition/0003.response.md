The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. It also accepts a parameter `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `x` is a list of `n` integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results for each test case. Each result is based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.**
