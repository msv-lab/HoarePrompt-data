Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all possible configurations of the square's corners. The logic checks only a few specific conditions, but there are multiple ways the coordinates can be arranged, and the program does not account for all of them.

For example, the program assumes that the first two points will have the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, which is not always the case. The correct approach would be to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates, and then calculating the area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Find the side length of the square
        side_length = min(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords), max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        
        # Calculate and print the area
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This version correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates, and then calculates the area. It works for any valid input configuration of the square's corners.
