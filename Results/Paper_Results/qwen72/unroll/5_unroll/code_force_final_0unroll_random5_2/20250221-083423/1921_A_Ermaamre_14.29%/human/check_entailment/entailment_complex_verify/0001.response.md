### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`, and then reads four pairs of coordinates for each test case. This part of the program is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Coordinate Comparison:**
   - The program attempts to determine the side length of the square by comparing specific pairs of coordinates. However, the coordinates are given in a random order, and the program only checks three specific permutations:
     - `if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`
     - `elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`
     - `elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`
   - These conditions are not exhaustive. For example, if the coordinates are given as:
     ```
     1 2
     1 5
     4 2
     4 5
     ```
     The program will not correctly identify the side length because it does not check for the case where `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` (which would be the correct condition for this input).

3. **Side Length Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the side length by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that share the same x-coordinate. This is correct in principle, but the program fails to handle all possible permutations of the coordinates.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area is correctly calculated by squaring the side length and printed for each test case. This part of the program is accurate.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling:**
   - The program only checks specific pairs of coordinates, which is insufficient to handle all possible permutations of the coordinates. This can lead to incorrect side length calculations and, consequently, incorrect area calculations.

2. **General Solution:**
   - To correctly handle all possible permutations of the coordinates, the program should:
     - Collect all four points into a list.
     - Sort the points by their x-coordinates to identify the side length along the x-axis.
     - Sort the points by their y-coordinates to identify the side length along the y-axis.
     - Ensure that the side length is consistent (i.e., the differences in x and y coordinates should be the same).

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for j in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points by x-coordinate
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])
        
        # The side length can be determined by the difference in x or y coordinates
        # of the points with the same y or x coordinates, respectively.
        side_length_x = abs(points[0][0] - points[1][0])
        
        # Sort points by y-coordinate
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])
        
        side_length_y = abs(points[0][1] - points[1][1])
        
        # Verify that both side lengths are the same
        if side_length_x != side_length_y:
            print("Error: The given points do not form a square.")
        else:
            print(side_length_x ** 2)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible permutations of the coordinates and may fail to correctly identify the side length of the square.

Final: **False**
