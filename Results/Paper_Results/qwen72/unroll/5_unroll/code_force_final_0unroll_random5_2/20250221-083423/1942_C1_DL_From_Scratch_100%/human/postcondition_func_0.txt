The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from input, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie. It then calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted vertices, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer and y = 0, and the input list of vertices is processed for each test case.
