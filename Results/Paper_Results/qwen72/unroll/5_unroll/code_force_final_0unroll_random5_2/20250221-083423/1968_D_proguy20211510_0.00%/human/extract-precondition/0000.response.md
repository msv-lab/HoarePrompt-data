Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya `P_B` and Sasha `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.**

For a correct function definition, it should look something like this:
```
def permutation_game(t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, a):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), P_B and P_S are integers (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), p is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and a is a list of integers of length n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
