You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya `P_B` and Sasha `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

    #State: The loop processes each test case, updating the starting positions `pb` and `ps` as well as the arrays `b` and `s` for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the maximum scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya `P_B` and Sasha `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It returns the result based on these inputs, but the specific return values are not provided in the problem description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
