Output State: **The loop processes each test case, updating the starting positions `pb` and `ps` as well as the arrays `b` and `s` for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the maximum scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed.**
