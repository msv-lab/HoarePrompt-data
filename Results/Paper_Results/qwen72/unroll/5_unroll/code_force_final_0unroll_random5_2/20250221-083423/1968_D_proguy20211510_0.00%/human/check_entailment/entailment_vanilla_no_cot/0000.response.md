Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Max Score Calculation**: The solution assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in the `a` array, they will stay at that position and accumulate the maximum value for the remaining turns. However, this is not always the optimal strategy. The players can also move to other positions that might yield a higher score over multiple turns due to the cumulative effect of the `a` values at those positions.

2. **Handling of Cycles in Permutations**: The permutation array `p` can contain cycles. The solution does not properly handle these cycles, which can significantly affect the score over multiple turns. For example, if a player is in a cycle, they might revisit the same positions multiple times, and the score should be calculated based on the cycle's properties.

3. **Unnecessary Variables and Constants**: The solution introduces variables and constants like `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha`, which are not used in the problem and can be removed to simplify the code.

4. **Inefficient Score Calculation**: The solution calculates the score for each turn up to `k` turns, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)). A more efficient approach would be to detect cycles and calculate the score based on the cycle length and the number of complete cycles within `k` turns.

Here is a more efficient and correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start, k):
            score = 0
            visited = {}
            position = start
            for i in range(k):
                if position in visited:
                    cycle_length = i - visited[position]
                    cycle_score = score - visited[position][1]
                    remaining_turns = k - i
                    full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
                    score += full_cycles * cycle_score
                    i += full_cycles * cycle_length
                score += a[position - 1]
                visited[position] = (i, score)
                position = p[position - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = calculate_score(pb, k)
        sasha_score = calculate_score(ps, k)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

**Explanation of the Correct Solution:**

1. **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function detects cycles in the permutation. It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions and their corresponding scores and turn counts. If a position is revisited, it calculates the score for the remaining turns based on the cycle length and score.

2. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the score for each player by simulating the game up to `k` turns, taking into account the cycles to avoid unnecessary repeated calculations.

3. **Comparison**: After calculating the scores for both players, the function compares them and prints the result accordingly.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct and efficient for the given constraints.
