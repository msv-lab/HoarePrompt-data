Output State: **The loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then calculates d as c divided by 2. If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, it prints a * b. Otherwise, it prints the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged.**
