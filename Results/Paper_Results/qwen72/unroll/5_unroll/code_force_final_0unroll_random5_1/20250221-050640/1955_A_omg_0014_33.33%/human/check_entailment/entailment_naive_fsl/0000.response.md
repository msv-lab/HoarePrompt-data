Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. The problem description states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the program reads `n` as the number of test cases and then tries to read three integers for each test case, which is incorrect.

2. **Variable Naming**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the program, but they do not match the problem description. The problem description uses `n`, `a`, and `b` for the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem description.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This is not the correct way to determine the minimum cost. The correct approach should involve comparing the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

Here is a correct implementation for reference:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_yogurts():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        cost_with_promotion = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price
        cost_with_regular = (n % 2) * a
        # Calculate the total minimum cost
        total_cost = cost_with_promotion + cost_with_regular
        # Compare with the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price
        min_cost = min(total_cost, n * a)
        print(min_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_yogurts()
```

This implementation correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.
