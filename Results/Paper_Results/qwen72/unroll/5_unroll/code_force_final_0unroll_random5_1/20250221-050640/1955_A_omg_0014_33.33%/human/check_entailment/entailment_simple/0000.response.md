Reasoning:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Variable Names and Input Mismatch**: The function `func()` reads an integer `n` which is supposed to be the number of test cases. However, inside the loop, it reads `a, b, c` instead of `n, a, b`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem statement and should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The promotion price `b` is already the price for two yogurts, so there's no need to divide it by 2. Instead, the program should directly compare the cost of buying yogurts individually versus buying them in pairs.

3. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**: The logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. The program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price if necessary.

4. **Rounding Issue**: The program uses `round(a * d)`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The cost should be an integer, and the rounding can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        remaining_cost = (n % 2) * a
        
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + remaining_cost
        
        print(total_cost)
```

Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - `pairs_cost` calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price `b`.
  - `remaining_cost` calculates the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price `a`.
  - The total cost is the sum of `pairs_cost` and `remaining_cost`.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
