Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem of calculating the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. However, there are a few issues with the program that affect its correctness:

1. **Handling of Coordinates**: The program assumes that the input coordinates will always be such that two pairs of x-coordinates are equal, and the other two pairs of y-coordinates are equal. This assumption is correct for squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but the program does not correctly identify which pairs of coordinates are the sides of the square. It only checks for specific pairs, which might not always be the correct pairs to calculate the side length.

2. **Logic for Calculating Side Length**: The program uses a series of `if` statements to determine the side length of the square. However, these conditions are not comprehensive enough to handle all possible permutations of the input coordinates. For example, if the coordinates are given in the order (1, 2), (4, 2), (1, 5), (4, 5), the program will not correctly identify the side length because it only checks for specific pairs of coordinates being equal.

3. **General Solution**: A more robust approach would be to sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then calculate the side length as the difference between the smallest and second smallest x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), since the sides of the square are parallel to the axes.

Given these issues, the program will not correctly handle all possible inputs and will fail to compute the correct area for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
