Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of the input. Specifically, the program assumes a specific order of the coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The coordinates of the corners are given in random order, and the program only checks for a few specific arrangements of the coordinates. This can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
4 2
1 5
```
The program will correctly output `9`. However, if the coordinates are given in a different order:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```
The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square and will produce an incorrect result. The program should be modified to correctly identify the side length regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
