Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are given in random order, but it is guaranteed that they form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
