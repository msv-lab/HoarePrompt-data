The code snippet `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the elements of the `results` list, joined by newline characters, to the standard output, followed by an additional newline character. The values of `index` and `T` are not affected by this code, and the `results` list remains unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`index` is `2 + T * (n + 1)`, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing `T` strings, each representing the last year calculated for each iteration of the loop. The content of `results` has been printed to the standard output, each string on a new line, followed by an additional newline.**
