Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The logic in the program correctly follows the problem's requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once and processes it using a list `data`. It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterating over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it occurs strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

3. **Output Writing**: The program appends the result for each test case to a list `results` and then writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - First sign occurs in year 3.
  - Second sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4, and 4 is a multiple of 2).
  - Third sign occurs in year 8 (since 4 + 1 = 5, and the next multiple of 4 is 8).
  - Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since 8 + 1 = 9, and the next multiple of 5 is 10).
  - Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since 10 + 1 = 11, and the next multiple of 9 is 18).
  - Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since 18 + 1 = 19, and the next multiple of 18 is 36).

- **Test Case 2**: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - First sign occurs in year 1.
  - Second sign occurs in year 2 (since 1 + 1 = 2, and 2 is a multiple of 2).
  - Third sign occurs in year 3 (since 2 + 1 = 3, and 3 is a multiple of 3).
  - Fourth sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4, and 4 is a multiple of 4).
  - Fifth sign occurs in year 5 (since 4 + 1 = 5, and 5 is a multiple of 5).

- **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the n-th sign occurs in year 5.

- **Test Case 4**: `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - First sign occurs in year 50.
  - Second sign occurs in year 60 (since 50 + 1 = 51, and the next multiple of 30 is 60).
  - Third sign occurs in year 711 (since 60 + 1 = 61, and the next multiple of 711 is 711).
  - Fourth sign occurs in year 800 (since 711 + 1 = 712, and the next multiple of 200 is 800).
  - Fifth sign occurs in year 1006 (since 800 + 1 = 801, and the next multiple of 503 is 1006).
  - Sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (since 1006 + 1 = 1007, and the next multiple of 1006 is 2012).

The program correctly calculates the year for each test case based on the given periodicities and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. Therefore, the program is correct.
