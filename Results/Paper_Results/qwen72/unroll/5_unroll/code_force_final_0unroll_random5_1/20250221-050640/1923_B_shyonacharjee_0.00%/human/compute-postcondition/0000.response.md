Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), `a` (a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `x` (a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
