The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case is provided as a tuple in the list `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of bullets you can fire per second), `a` (a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster), and `x` (a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one test case. The result for each test case is the minimum time required to eliminate all the monsters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing four values: `n` (number of monsters), `k` (bullets per second), `a` (list of monster healths), and `x` (list of monster positions). It returns a list of the minimum times required to eliminate all monsters for each test case.**
