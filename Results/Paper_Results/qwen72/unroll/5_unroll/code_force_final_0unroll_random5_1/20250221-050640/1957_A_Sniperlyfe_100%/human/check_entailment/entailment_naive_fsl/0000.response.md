Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of polygons with more than 3 sides. The function `func_1` only considers polygons with 3 sides (triangles) by using `v // 3` to count the number of polygons. However, the problem description states that polygons can have any number of sides, and the maximum number of regular polygons should be determined. For example, in the test case where the input is `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`, the program will output `1` (considering only triangles), but the correct output should be `1` for a square (4 sides) and not a triangle. Similarly, in the test case `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`, the program will output `3` (considering only triangles), but the correct output should be `2` (one pentagon and one square). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
