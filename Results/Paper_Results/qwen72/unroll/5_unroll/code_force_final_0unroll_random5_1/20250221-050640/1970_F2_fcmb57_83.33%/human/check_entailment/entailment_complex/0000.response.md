Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes the players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - The `mouvements` dictionary is correctly defined to handle the movement directions.
   - The `middle` variable is correctly calculated to represent the center of the field.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (U, D, L, R), the program updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - For catching actions (C), the program should update the player who is carrying the Quaffle. However, there is a typo in the code where `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
   - For throwing actions (T), the program correctly checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also prints the appropriate goal message and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle if a goal is scored.

3. **Player Elimination:**
   - The program correctly checks for player elimination by comparing the player's position with the Bludger's position.
   - It prints the elimination message and updates the Quaffle's position if the eliminated player was carrying it.
   - It correctly deletes the eliminated player from the `players` dictionary.

4. **Final Score:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to handle the movement of players. However, it is incorrectly defined and used.
   - The function should take the current position of the player and the movement direction, and return the new position.
   - The function is currently defined to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a tuple representing the current position and `b` is a tuple representing the movement direction. However, `b` is being passed as a single character (U, D, L, R), which is not a tuple.
   - This results in a `TypeError` when the function is called, as it attempts to unpack an integer (the result of `mouvements[mo[1]]` is a tuple, but it is being passed as `b`).

Given the issues with the `func_1` function and the typo in the catching action, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
