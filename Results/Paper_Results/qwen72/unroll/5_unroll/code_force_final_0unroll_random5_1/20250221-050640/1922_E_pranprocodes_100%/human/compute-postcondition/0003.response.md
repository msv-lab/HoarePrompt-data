Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly but reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and a list of integers `X` (each element 2 <= x <= 10^18) from user input. For each integer `x` in `X`, it performs a series of operations to reduce `x` to 1, appending specific values to a list `ans` during the process. The values appended are `max` (starting from 100000000 and decrementing) when `x` is even, and `min` (starting from -100000000 and incrementing) when `x` is odd. After reducing `x` to 1, it prints the number of operations performed (`t`) and the list `ans` in reverse order. The function does not return any value. **
