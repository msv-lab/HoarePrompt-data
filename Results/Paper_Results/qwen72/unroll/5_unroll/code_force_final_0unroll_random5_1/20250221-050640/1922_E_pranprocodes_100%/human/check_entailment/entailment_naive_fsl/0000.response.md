Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for certain values of X. Here is an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
13
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
or any other valid array that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

**Actual Output:**
```
4
-100000000 -99999999 100000000 99999999
```

The actual output array has 4 elements, and the number of increasing subsequences it generates is not 13. The program's logic for constructing the array does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will match the given X for all possible values of X. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
