The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `X`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `X` is a list of integers where each element `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 10^18. The function returns a list of results based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and a list of integers `X` (each element 2 <= x <= 10^18), and returns a list of results based on the input parameters.**
