Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and X is a list of integers where each element x satisfies 2 <= x <= 10^18. The loop prints the number of iterations (t) it took to reduce each x to 1, followed by a list of integers (ans) that were appended during the iterations, in reverse order. The values of max and min are unchanged for each new x, but they are modified within each iteration of the loop for a given x.**
