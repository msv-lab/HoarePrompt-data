### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined correctly and reads the input as specified in the problem description.
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning to handle 1-based indexing, which is a common practice in competitive programming.
   - The array `b` is also initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning for the same reason.

2. **Array `b` Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the array `b` where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than `a[i]` for any `i` where `a[i] > 1`, and `b[i]` is always `2` for any `i` where `a[i] == 1`.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation for `a`:**
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function to calculate the cumulative sum of the array `a`.
   - This is a correct approach to efficiently handle the sum of subarrays.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks two conditions:
     - `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`: This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[x:y]`.
     - `x == y`: This condition checks if the subarray has a length of 1.
   - If either condition is true, the program prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

5. **Subarray of Length 1:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program should print "NO" for subarrays of length 1.
   - The condition `x == y` is correctly used to handle this case.
   - However, the original assessment states that the program will print "YES" for subarrays of length 1, which is incorrect. The program actually prints "NO" for subarrays of length 1 due to the `x == y` condition.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       5 4
       1 2 1 4 5
       1 1
       4 4
       3 3
       1 3
       ```
     - Output:
       ```
       NO
       NO
       NO
       NO
       ```
   - For the queries:
     - `1 1`: `a[1] - a[0] = 1 - 0 = 1` and `b[1] - b[0] = 2 - 0 = 2`. Since `1 < 2` and `x == y`, the program prints "NO".
     - `4 4`: `a[4] - a[3] = 7 - 3 = 4` and `b[4] - b[3] = 5 - 3 = 2`. Since `4 > 2` and `x == y`, the program prints "NO".
     - `3 3`: `a[3] - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `b[3] - b[2] = 4 - 2 = 2`. Since `2 == 2` and `x == y`, the program prints "NO".
     - `1 3`: `a[3] - a[0] = 3 - 0 = 3` and `b[3] - b[0] = 4 - 0 = 4`. Since `3 < 4` and `x != y`, the program prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program will print "YES" for subarrays of length 1. The program correctly handles subarrays of length 1 by printing "NO" due to the `x == y` condition. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
