Output State: **The function should be called with no arguments, and it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and 1 indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of an input integer to the variable `t`. This input integer is expected to represent the number of test cases the function will handle. The other preconditions remain unchanged.
