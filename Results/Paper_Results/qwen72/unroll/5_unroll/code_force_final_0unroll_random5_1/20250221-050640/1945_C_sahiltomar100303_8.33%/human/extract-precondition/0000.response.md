Precondition: **The function should be called with no arguments, and it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and 1 indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should process these inputs to determine the optimal position i for laying the road.**
