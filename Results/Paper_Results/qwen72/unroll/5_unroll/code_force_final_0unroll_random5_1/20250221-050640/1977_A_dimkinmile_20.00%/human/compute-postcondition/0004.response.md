The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the conditions for the function, including the parameters `n` and `m` which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` is less than `m`.
- The function is also expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- However, the provided code snippet does not use any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Output:
The code snippet will print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, or `t`.

Output: **No**
