You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The loop prints the largest odd divisor of x that is less than or equal to k for each iteration, where k = x // n. If k == 1, it prints 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `x` and `n` from the input. The function then calculates the largest odd divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k = x // n`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest odd divisor found. The function performs this operation for each of the `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of n sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to x.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{n} \right\rfloor \), which is the maximum possible difficulty for each sub-problem if they are all equal.
   - If \( k = 1 \), the only possible GCD is 1, so it prints 1 and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It then iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to \( \sqrt{x} \) with a step of 2.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
     - If `i` is a divisor and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `i` as a potential GCD.
     - If `x // i` is a divisor and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `x // i` as a potential GCD.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the potential GCDs found.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( k = 1 \), the only possible GCD is 1.
   - The program iterates over possible divisors of `x` up to \( \sqrt{x} \) to find the maximum GCD that can be achieved.
   - It correctly checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that all divisors are considered.
   - The program ensures that the chosen divisor is less than or equal to `k` to maintain the condition that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 1 and `n` is 1 correctly by printing 1.
   - The program handles the case where `x` is even and `n` is 1 correctly by printing `x`.
   - The program handles the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1 correctly by printing 1.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The program efficiently iterates over divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems.
   - The edge cases and general cases are handled appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
