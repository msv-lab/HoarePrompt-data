Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for finding the maximum balance of the problemset. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum GCD is flawed. The program should consider the GCD of all possible sub-problems, but it only checks a limited range of divisors, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
12 4
```
The expected output is 3, because the sub-problems can be divided into difficulties 3, 3, 3, and 3, giving a GCD of 3. However, the provided program will output 1, which is incorrect.

The program should instead use a more robust approach to find the maximum GCD, such as iterating through all possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.
