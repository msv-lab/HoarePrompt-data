The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If no such divisor is found, the function returns 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If no such divisor is found, it returns 1.**
