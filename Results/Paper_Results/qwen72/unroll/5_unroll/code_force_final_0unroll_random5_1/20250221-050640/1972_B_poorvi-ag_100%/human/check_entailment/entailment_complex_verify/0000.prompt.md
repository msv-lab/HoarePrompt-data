You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, where each character is either "U" or "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` now contains a list of strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing the same list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no'. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console, but the contents of `results` are not modified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of the number of coins and their states (either "U" or "D"). For each test case, the function checks if the number of coins facing up ("U") is odd. If it is, the function appends "yes" to a list; otherwise, it appends "no". After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the list to the console. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes a list `results` containing "yes" or "no" for each test case, and this list is printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of 'U' coins is odd or even and decides the winner based on that. However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not consider the actual game mechanics, such as the removal of a coin and the flipping of adjacent coins.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
UUDUD
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
yes
```

The program outputs "yes" because the number of 'U' coins is odd. However, this does not necessarily mean Alice will win. The game mechanics involve removing a coin and flipping adjacent coins, which can change the outcome. For example, in the given input, Alice can win by playing optimally, but the program does not simulate the game to determine the correct winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
