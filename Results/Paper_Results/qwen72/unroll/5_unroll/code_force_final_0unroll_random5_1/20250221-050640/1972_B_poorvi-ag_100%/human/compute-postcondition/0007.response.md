Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of the number of coins and their states (either "U" or "D"). For each test case, the function checks if the number of coins facing up ("U") is odd. If it is, the function appends "yes" to a list; otherwise, it appends "no". After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the list to the console. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes a list `results` containing "yes" or "no" for each test case, and this list is printed to the console. **
