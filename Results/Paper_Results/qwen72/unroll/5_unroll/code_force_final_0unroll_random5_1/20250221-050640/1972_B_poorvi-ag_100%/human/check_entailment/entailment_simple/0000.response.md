### Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins ("U"). The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. Specifically:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win.

This is because:
- Alice goes first, and if there is an odd number of facing-up coins, she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
- Bob, on his turn, will then be forced to leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice.
- This pattern continues until one player is left with no facing-up coins to choose, causing them to lose.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U" characters in the input string `arr` and appending "yes" to the `results` list if the count is odd, and "no" if the count is even. The program then prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case according to the rules, and outputs the correct result for each case. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem's requirements.
