Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 2n integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The integers in each test case are positive and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function should also handle up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.**

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the list of integers for each test case. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def max_score(test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each inner list containing 2n integers.
