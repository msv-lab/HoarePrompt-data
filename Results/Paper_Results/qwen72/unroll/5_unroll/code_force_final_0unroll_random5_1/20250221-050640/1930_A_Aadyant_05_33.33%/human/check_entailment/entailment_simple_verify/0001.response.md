### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Reading Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs to be chosen.
   - It then reads a line of `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number in each pair.

4. **Selecting Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element (starting from the first element) to add to `list2`. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and selecting every second element ensures that we are always choosing the smaller number in each pair.

5. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the elements in `list2`, which represents the maximum score for the current test case.
   - It appends this sum to the `out` list.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the `out` list and prints each score.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are chosen first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
  - The program correctly sums the selected elements and prints the results.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case of a single test case and multiple test cases.
  - It also handles the edge case where all elements are the same (as in the third test case).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 100 elements per test case, and up to 5000 test cases).

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function should accept a list of test cases, but it actually reads from standard input. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the solution as long as the input format is followed correctly.

- **State after reading the number of test cases**:
  - `num` is correctly read as the number of test cases.

- **State after reading the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers**:
  - `a` is correctly read as the number of pairs.
  - `b` is correctly read as the list of integers and split into `list1`.

- **State after sorting the list**:
  - `list1` is correctly sorted in ascending order.

- **State after selecting the minimum values**:
  - `list2` is correctly populated with the minimum values from each pair.

- **State after calculating the score**:
  - The score for the current test case is correctly calculated and appended to `out`.

- **State after processing all test cases**:
  - `out` contains the correct scores for all test cases.
  - `list1` and `list2` are correctly emptied for the next test case.

- **State after printing the results**:
  - The results are correctly printed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem. The annotations confirm that the program's state at key points aligns with the expected behavior, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
