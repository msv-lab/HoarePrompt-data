To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `numbers` and `num`.

1. **`num`**: This variable is used to determine the number of iterations the loop will run. Since `num` is an input string, it must be converted to an integer for the loop to execute. The loop will execute if `int(num)` is greater than 0.
2. **`numbers`**: This variable is the loop counter, and it starts at 0 by default in Python's `range` function.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `num` is an input string.
- `out` is an empty list.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `num` is a positive integer when converted to an integer.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list**
