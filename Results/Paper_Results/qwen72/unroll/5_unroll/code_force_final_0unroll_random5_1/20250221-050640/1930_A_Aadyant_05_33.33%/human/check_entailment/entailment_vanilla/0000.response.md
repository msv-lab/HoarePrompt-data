### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Reading Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs to be chosen.
   - It then reads a line of `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number in each pair.

4. **Selecting Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element (starting from the first element) to add to `list2`. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and selecting every second element ensures that we are always choosing the smaller number in each pair.

5. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the elements in `list2`, which represents the maximum score for the current test case.
   - It appends this sum to the `out` list.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the `out` list and prints each score.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are chosen first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
  - The program correctly sums the selected elements and prints the results.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case of a single test case and multiple test cases.
  - It also handles the edge case where all elements are the same (as in the third test case).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 100 elements per test case, and up to 5000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
