You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 2n integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The integers in each test case are positive and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function should also handle up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        
        list1 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = input('')
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        list1.sort()
        
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        
        out.append(sum(list2))
        
        del list1[:]
        
        del list2[:]
        
    #State: `out` is a list containing the sum of the selected elements from each test case, and `list1` and `list2` are empty lists.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The `out` list remains unchanged, and `list1` and `list2` are still empty lists.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input integers are not sorted in non-decreasing order. The program sorts the list of integers, but it does not ensure that the pairs are correctly formed to maximize the score. Specifically, the program always picks the smallest element in each pair, which might not be optimal if the list is not sorted correctly.

However, the sorting step in the program is actually correct for the purpose of this problem. The issue lies in the way the program pairs the elements. The program pairs elements as `(list1[0], list1[2]), (list1[2], list1[4]), ...`, but it should pair them as `(list1[0], list1[1]), (list1[2], list1[3]), ...` to ensure that the minimum of each pair is maximized.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
3 1 4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

The program incorrectly pairs the elements as `(1, 3)` and `(2, 4)`, resulting in a score of `1 + 3 = 4`. However, the correct pairs should be `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`, resulting in a score of `1 + 2 = 3`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
