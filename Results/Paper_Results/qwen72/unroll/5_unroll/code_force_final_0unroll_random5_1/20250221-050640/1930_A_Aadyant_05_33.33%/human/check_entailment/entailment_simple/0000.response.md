### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `num` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of pairs `a` and the list of integers `b`.
   - The list of integers `b` is split into a list of strings and then sorted.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function initializes an empty list `list2`.
   - It then iterates over the first `a` elements of the sorted list `list1`, appending every second element (starting from the first) to `list2`.
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is calculated and appended to the `out` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in the `out` list, which represents the maximum score for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting the List:**
  - Sorting the list `list1` ensures that the smallest elements are considered first. This is crucial because the goal is to maximize the score by always choosing the smaller of the two elements in each move.
  - By selecting every second element starting from the first, the function effectively pairs the smallest elements together, which maximizes the minimum value in each pair.

- **Appending to `list2`:**
  - The function appends every second element from the sorted list to `list2`. This is correct because it ensures that the smallest elements are used in the score calculation.

- **Summing the Elements:**
  - The sum of the elements in `list2` is the maximum score that can be achieved for the given test case. This is correct because the smallest elements are being used, and the sum of these elements is the optimal score.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and processing each one independently.
  - The `out` list is used to store the results of each test case, and these results are printed at the end.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where all elements are the same, as well as cases with varying elements, correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly processes the input, sorts the list, selects the appropriate elements, and calculates the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
