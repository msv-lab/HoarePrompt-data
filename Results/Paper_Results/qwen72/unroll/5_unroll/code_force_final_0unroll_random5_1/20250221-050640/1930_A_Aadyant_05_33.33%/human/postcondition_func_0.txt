The function `func` reads a series of test cases from user input. Each test case consists of a list of 2n positive integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and each integer is within the range 1 to 10^7. The function processes up to 5000 test cases. For each test case, it selects every second element from the sorted list of integers and calculates the sum of these selected elements. The function then prints the sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the `out` list contains the sums of the selected elements for each test case, and `list1` and `list2` are empty lists.
