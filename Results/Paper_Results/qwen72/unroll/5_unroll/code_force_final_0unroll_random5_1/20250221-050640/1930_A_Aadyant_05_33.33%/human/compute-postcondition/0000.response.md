Output State: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 2n integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The integers in each test case are positive and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function should also handle up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. `num` is an input string.**
