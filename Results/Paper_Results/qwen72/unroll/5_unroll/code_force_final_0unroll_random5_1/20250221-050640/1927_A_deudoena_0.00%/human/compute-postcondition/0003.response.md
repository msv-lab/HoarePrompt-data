Output State: **`ind2` is 0, `ind1` is 0, `outind` is 0, the function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. `inpstr` is a string input provided by the user.**

The variable `outind` is initialized to 0, while the values of `ind2`, `ind1`, and `inpstr` remain unchanged. The function's parameters and their constraints also remain the same.
