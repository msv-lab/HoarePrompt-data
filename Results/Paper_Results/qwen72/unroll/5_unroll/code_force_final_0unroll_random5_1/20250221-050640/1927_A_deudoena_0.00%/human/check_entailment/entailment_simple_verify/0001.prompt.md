You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind2` is 0, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (counting from the end, starting from 0), `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr, ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in inpstr, and ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a strip of cells, each of which is either white ('W') or black ('B').
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will result in all cells being white.
   - The segment to be painted should cover all black cells, and it should be the smallest possible segment that does so.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads a single input string `inpstr` which represents the strip of cells.
   - It initializes three variables: `ind1`, `ind2`, and `outind` to 0.
   - The first loop iterates through the string to find the index of the first black cell (`ind1`).
   - The second loop iterates through the string in reverse to find the index of the last black cell (`ind2`).
   - Finally, it calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted white as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

3. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Finding the first black cell (`ind1`)**:
     - The loop `for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr)` iterates through the string and stops at the first occurrence of 'B'.
     - The index of this first black cell is stored in `ind1`.
   - **Finding the last black cell (`ind2`)**:
     - The loop `for i in range(len(inpstr))` iterates through the string in reverse.
     - The index of the last black cell is stored in `ind2`.
     - Note that `ind2` is calculated from the end of the string, so it represents the distance from the end of the string to the last black cell.
   - **Calculating the segment length**:
     - The length of the segment that needs to be painted white is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
     - This formula is correct because:
       - `ind1` is the index of the first black cell from the start.
       - `ind2` is the index of the last black cell from the end.
       - `len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1` gives the index of the last black cell from the start.
       - The segment length is then `last_black_index - first_black_index + 1`, which simplifies to `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string contains only one black cell, the program will correctly identify the segment length as 1.
   - If the string contains multiple black cells, the program will correctly identify the segment length as the distance between the first and last black cells.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white.
   - The logic and the formula used are correct and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.
