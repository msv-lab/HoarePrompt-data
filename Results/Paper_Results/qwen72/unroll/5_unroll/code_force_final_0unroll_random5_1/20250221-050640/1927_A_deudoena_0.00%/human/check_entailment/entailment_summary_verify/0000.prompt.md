You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input, finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' (`ind2`), and prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of these indices (`len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`). The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem description specifies that there will be multiple test cases, each with its own input. The provided program only reads a single string and processes it, ignoring the number of test cases and the length of the strip for each test case. This means the program will fail for any input that contains multiple test cases.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the strip is already entirely white. According to the problem description, if the strip is already all white, the output should be 0. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output the length of the strip.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
2
3
WWW
4
BWWB
```
The expected output is:
```
0
2
```
But the program will output:
```
3
2
```
This is incorrect because the first test case should output 0 since the strip is already all white.
