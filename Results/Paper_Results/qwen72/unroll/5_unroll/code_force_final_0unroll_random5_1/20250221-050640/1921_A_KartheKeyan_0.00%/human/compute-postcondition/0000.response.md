Output State: **The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The list will contain exactly four tuples, and each x_i and y_i will be an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates will form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is 0, and the values of `s` and `l` depend on the inputs provided during execution.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies the input format and constraints for the list of tuples, which are not affected by the code.
- The variable `n` is initially set by `int(input())` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0.
- The variable `l` is set by `int(input())` in each iteration of the while loop, and its value depends on the input provided.
- The variable `s` is calculated as `s += (l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` in each iteration, and its value depends on the value of `l`.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
- The values of `s` and `l` are not fixed and depend on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop.
