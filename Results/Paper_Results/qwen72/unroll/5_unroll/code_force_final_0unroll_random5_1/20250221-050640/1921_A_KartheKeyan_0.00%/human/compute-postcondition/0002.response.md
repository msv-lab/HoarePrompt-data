The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since the problem does not specify any constraints on `n` other than it being an integer, we can assume that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The list will contain exactly four tuples, and each x_i and y_i will be an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates will form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, and the values of `s` and `l` depend on the inputs provided during execution.**
