Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies `sequence` by appending a series of integers and always returns the tuple (0, 0). The final state of the program is such that `sequence` contains a sequence of integers that are generated based on the input `number`, and `number` is reduced through recursive calls until it reaches a value that no longer satisfies the condition `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`. The length of `sequence` is at most 200, and all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. **
