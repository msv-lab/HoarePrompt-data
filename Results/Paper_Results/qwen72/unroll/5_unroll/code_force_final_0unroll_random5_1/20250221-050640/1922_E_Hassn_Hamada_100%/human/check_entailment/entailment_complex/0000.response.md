Reasoning:

The program aims to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The core idea of the program is to use a recursive function `func_1` to build the array by appending integers in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Recursive Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to reduce the problem size by finding the largest possible value `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number` and appending a sequence of integers to `sequence`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with the reduced `number` value: `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - The base case for the recursion is when `number == 0`. At this point, the function returns `(0, 0)`, which is not used in the program but serves as a termination condition.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function constructs the sequence by appending integers from `overlap` to `size - 1` to `sequence`.
   - The loop ensures that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.

4. **Output**:
   - After the function `func_1` completes, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence is empty or if the function fails to generate a valid sequence, the program should print `-1`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Sequence Length**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the sequence exceeds 200. However, the recursive nature and the way `size` is chosen should ensure that the sequence length does not exceed 200 for valid inputs.

2. **Range of Elements**:
   - The elements appended to `sequence` are integers in the range `[0, size - 1]`, which is within the allowed range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

3. **Correctness of Subsequence Count**:
   - The function correctly calculates the number of increasing subsequences by using the formula `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap)`, which is a power of 2 minus a smaller power of 2. This formula is used to ensure that the number of subsequences is correctly reduced in each recursive call.

4. **Handling Invalid Inputs**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where it is impossible to find a valid sequence. However, the problem description guarantees that `X` is in the range `[2, 10^18]`, and the program should always find a valid sequence for such inputs.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The recursive function `func_1` is designed to handle the problem efficiently, and the sequence construction ensures that the elements are within the allowed range and the length does not exceed 200.

However, there is a minor issue in the function `func_1` where it returns `(0, 0)` even though the return value is not used. This is not a functional issue but a stylistic one.

Given the problem constraints and the program's logic, the program should be correct for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
