Output State: **The function documentation does not change any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, with a length of at most 200. All elements of `sequence` should be in the range [-10^9; 10^9].**
