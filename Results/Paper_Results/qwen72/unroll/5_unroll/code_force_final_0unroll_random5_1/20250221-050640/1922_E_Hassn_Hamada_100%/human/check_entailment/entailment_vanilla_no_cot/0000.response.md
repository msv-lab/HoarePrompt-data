Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Output for Single Element Arrays**: The program prints `1` and `0` for the input `2`, which is incorrect. An array of length `1` can only have `1` increasing subsequence (the array itself), not `2`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic inside `func_1` is not correctly generating the required array. The function uses bitwise operations to try to generate the sequence, but it does not correctly handle the generation of sequences that meet the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Handling of Overlap and Size**: The way the function handles the `size` and `overlap` variables is not clear and does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. The bitwise operations and the loop conditions are not well-suited for the task of generating the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Incorrect Sequence Generation**: The sequence generated by the function does not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences. For example, for `X = 5`, the output `0 1 0` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where it might be impossible to find a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it does not print `-1` in such cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to generate sequences that have exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it should handle cases where such a sequence cannot be generated. The current implementation does not achieve this.
