Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The subsequences are considered different if they have different positions in the array, even if they contain the same elements.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sequence.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with \( X - 1 \) and the `result` list.
   - It prints the length of the `result` list and the list itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining `number`.
   - It appends a series of integers to the `sequence` list.
   - It recursively calls itself with the reduced `number`.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences by using a binary representation approach.
   - The sequence is constructed by appending integers in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is controlled.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the elements are within the specified range.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X \) is 2, which is the smallest valid input.
   - It also handles larger values of \( X \) up to \( 10^{18} \) by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems using recursion.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence is constructed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, which is the main requirement of the problem.

7. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary indicates that the sequence is generated correctly and that the length of the sequence is at most 200.
   - The elements of the sequence are within the specified range.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate an array that meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
