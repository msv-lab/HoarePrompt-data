You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, with a length of at most 200. All elements of sequence should be in the range [-10^9; 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, with a length of at most 200. All elements of `sequence` should be in the range [-10^9; 10^9]. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: `size_overlap` is a tuple (size, i) where `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and `i` is the corresponding index from the loop. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: `size` remains the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`, `overlap` remains the corresponding index from the loop, `size_overlap` remains a tuple (size, overlap), `number` remains unchanged, and `sequence` is updated to contain the integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It always returns the tuple (0, 0).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0, 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
