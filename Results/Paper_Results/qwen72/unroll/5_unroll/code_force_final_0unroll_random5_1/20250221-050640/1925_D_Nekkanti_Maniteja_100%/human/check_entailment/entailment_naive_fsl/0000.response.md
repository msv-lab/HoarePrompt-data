Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the sum of friendship values by updating the sum `s` in a way that does not reflect the problem's requirements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
   ```
   This correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Sum of initial friendship values**:
   ```python
   a = 0
   for i in range(m):
       (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   This correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the expected sum**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   This part of the code is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the current friendship value. The current logic incorrectly multiplies the index `i` by `c * m` and adds it to the sum, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

The correct approach should be to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and then sum these expected values. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs of children.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * a) % M
            a = (a + m) % M
        print(s % M)
```

In the corrected version:
- `s` is the sum of the expected friendship values.
- `a` is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- For each excursion, the expected value of the sum of friendship values is `c * a`, which is added to `s`.
- After each excursion, the sum of the current friendship values `a` is updated by adding `m` (the number of friend pairs) to account for the increase in friendship values for the chosen pairs.

This corrected version should handle all potential cases correctly.
