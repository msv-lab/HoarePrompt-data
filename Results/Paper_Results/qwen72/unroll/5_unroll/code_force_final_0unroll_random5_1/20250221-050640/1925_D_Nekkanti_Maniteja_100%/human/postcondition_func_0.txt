The function `func()` is intended to process a series of inputs to compute a result based on the number of people `n`, the number of friendship pairs `m`, and a threshold `k`. However, the function as provided is incomplete and does not match the intended problem description. It reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case includes `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial values. The function calculates a value `s` using a modular inverse and the sum of friendship values, and prints the result of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case. The final state of the function includes the printed results and the updated sum of friendship values `a`.
