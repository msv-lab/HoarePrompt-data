You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The function `func()` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The variables `s` and `a` will be updated after the loop execution. `s` will be the result of the loop computation modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `a` will be the sum of all friendship values `f` from the input tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples `friendships`. It processes the friendships and their values to determine an outcome based on the threshold `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
