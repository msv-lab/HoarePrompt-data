#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):

    #State: The function `func()` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The variables `s` and `a` will be updated after the loop execution. `s` will be the result of the loop computation modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `a` will be the sum of all friendship values `f` from the input tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` is intended to process a series of inputs to compute a result based on the number of people `n`, the number of friendship pairs `m`, and a threshold `k`. However, the function as provided is incomplete and does not match the intended problem description. It reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case includes `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial values. The function calculates a value `s` using a modular inverse and the sum of friendship values, and prints the result of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case. The final state of the function includes the printed results and the updated sum of friendship values `a`.
