### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.
   - It then checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE". This is the correct behavior for all other cases.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise. This matches the expected output format as described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should correctly output "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are not in a strict increasing or decreasing order, which should correctly output "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are `1 <= t <= 1000` and `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`, which are respected by the program's input handling. The program will correctly process up to 1000 test cases and handle digits within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The function summary and the original assessment are both accurate in their descriptions of the program's behavior.

### Correctness:
**True**
