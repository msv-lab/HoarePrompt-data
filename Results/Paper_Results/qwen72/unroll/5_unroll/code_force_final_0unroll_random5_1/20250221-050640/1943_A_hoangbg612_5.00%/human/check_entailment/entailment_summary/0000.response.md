### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - The goal is to determine the final MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1 and a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of elements in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, cur)` to find the smallest `i` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always choose the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX by choosing elements that are not the smallest missing element.
   - The program's logic seems to correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both players:
     - It sorts the array to ensure that the smallest elements are considered first.
     - It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of elements.
     - It breaks the loop when it finds a gap in the sequence, which is the MEX.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `N` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It correctly identifies the MEX when the array contains repeated elements.

5. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case independently and prints the correct MEX for each case.
   - The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` are not retained after each test case, which is appropriate for the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` when both Alice and Bob play optimally. The execution summary aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

**Correctness: True**
