### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach because it helps in determining the MEX in a sequential manner.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - `M` is a dictionary that will store the counts of each unique element in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop because the MEX has been found.
   - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any element `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case, which should be the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Dictionary Initialization**:
  - The dictionary `M` should be initialized inside the loop for each test case to avoid carrying over values from previous test cases.
  
- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program should not break the loop if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Instead, it should continue to find the smallest missing integer.
  - The final MEX calculation should be simplified to find the smallest integer not in the array `N`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = 0
        
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
        
        print(cur)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**:
  - `cur` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer.
  
- **Processing the Array**:
  - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
  - If the current element `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments `cur` by 1.
  - This ensures that `cur` is the smallest integer not present in the array `N`.

- **Output**:
  - The final value of `cur` is printed, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical issues in the MEX calculation and dictionary handling.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the MEX for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
