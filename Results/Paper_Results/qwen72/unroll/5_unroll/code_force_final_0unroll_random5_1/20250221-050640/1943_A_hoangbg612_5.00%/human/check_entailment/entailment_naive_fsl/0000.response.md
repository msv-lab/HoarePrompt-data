Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `N` contains duplicate elements correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating the `M` dictionary and the final loop to determine the MEX value is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output of the provided program:
```
2
```

In this test case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would result in the array `c` containing elements `[0, 1, 2]` after the game ends, making the MEX of `c` equal to 3. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2.

The issue lies in the logic for updating the `M` dictionary and the final loop to determine the MEX value. The program does not correctly account for the presence of duplicate elements and their impact on the MEX calculation.
