You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case includes the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` will hold the values from the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are such that they do not form any triangles, or where the chosen vertices are not in a configuration that maximizes the number of triangles. Specifically, the program only counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices and adds a fixed number of triangles (`x - 2`). This approach is incorrect because the number of triangles that can be formed depends on the specific configuration of the chosen vertices, not just the number of gaps.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 3 0
1 3 5
```
The vertices 1, 3, and 5 form a triangle, but the program will output `1` instead of `1` because it only counts the gaps and adds a fixed number of triangles. The correct output should be `1` because only one triangle can be formed with these vertices.

Another example:
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
Here, the vertices 1, 3, and 5 form a triangle, but the program will output `2` instead of `1` because it incorrectly counts the gaps and adds a fixed number of triangles. The correct output should be `1` because only one triangle can be formed with these vertices.

These examples show that the program does not correctly handle the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
