### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices, and we need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using these vertices.
   - Since \( y = 0 \), we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A triangle is formed by three vertices of the polygon.
   - To form a triangle, the vertices must be chosen such that the diagonals do not intersect.
   - The number of triangles that can be formed is maximized by ensuring that the chosen vertices are as close as possible to each other, forming the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (where \( y \) is always 0).
   - It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - The program counts the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are one vertex apart (i.e., \( \text{list0}[i + 1] - \text{list0}[i] - 1 = 1 \)).
   - It also checks the wrap-around condition (i.e., the distance between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the polygon's cyclic nature).
   - Finally, it prints the count of such pairs plus \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of pairs of consecutive vertices that are one vertex apart.
   - The wrap-around condition is also correctly handled.
   - The formula \( \text{count} + x - 2 \) is used to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles. This is because:
     - Each pair of consecutive vertices that are one vertex apart can form a triangle with the next vertex.
     - The remaining \( x - 2 \) vertices can form additional triangles by connecting them to the existing pairs.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( x = 2 \) correctly by outputting 0 (since no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices).
   - The program also handles the case where \( x = n \) correctly by outputting \( n - 2 \) (since the entire polygon can be triangulated).

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is \( O(x \log x) \) due to the sorting step, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \( O(x) \) for storing the chosen vertices, which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given constraints and problem description.

**Correctness: True**
