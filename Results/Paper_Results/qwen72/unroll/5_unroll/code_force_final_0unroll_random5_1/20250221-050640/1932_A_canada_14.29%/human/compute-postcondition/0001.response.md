Output State: **For each test case, the output state is the value of `ret` after the loop has finished executing. The value of `ret` is the number of times the character '@' appears in the string `s` before two consecutive '*' characters are encountered. If two consecutive '*' characters are found, the loop breaks, and the final value of `ret` is printed. The variables `len` and `s` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.**
