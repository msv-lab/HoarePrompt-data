### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits (`max(a, b, c) == b`) to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all digits are the same by printing "NONE".
   - The program correctly handles the case where the digits form a stair by printing "STAIR".
   - The program correctly handles the case where the digits form a peak by printing "PEAK".
   - The program correctly handles other cases (e.g., `a > b > c`, `a > b < c`, etc.) by printing "NONE".

4. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints are that `1 \leq t \leq 1000` and `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9`. The program does not violate these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
