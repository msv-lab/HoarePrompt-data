Output State: **The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line) and processes it according to the given conditions. For each line, it splits the line into two integers n and k. If k is greater than or equal to 2, and n equals k, it prints a sequence of k integers, each equal to k. If k is greater than or equal to 2 and n does not equal k, it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to n. The values of t, n, and k remain unchanged after the loop execution, but the output is generated based on the input lines.**
