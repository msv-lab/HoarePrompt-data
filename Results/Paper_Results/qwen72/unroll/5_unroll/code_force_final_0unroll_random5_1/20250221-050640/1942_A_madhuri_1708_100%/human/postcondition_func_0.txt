The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3). For each subsequent line, it processes two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints a sequence of `k` integers, each equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified by the function.
