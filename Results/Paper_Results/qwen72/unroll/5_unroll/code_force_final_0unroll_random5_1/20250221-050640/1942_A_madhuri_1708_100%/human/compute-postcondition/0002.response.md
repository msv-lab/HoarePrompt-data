The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including an integer `t` that represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`.

Given this information, the function `func` is expected to return different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the prompt. Assuming the function is designed to handle these test cases and return some form of result for each, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
