Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Handling of \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \)**:
   - The program prints `-1` for any case where \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \). This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for such cases. For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.

2. **Handling of \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \) for \( k = 1 \). This is correct because the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (itself).

3. **Handling of \( n = k \)**:
   - The program prints an array of \( k \) elements, each equal to \( k \). This is correct because the array `[k, k, ..., k]` (with \( n \) elements) is sorted in all \( n \) cyclic shifts.

However, the program fails to handle cases where \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \) correctly. For such cases, a valid solution can be constructed by creating an array with a specific pattern that ensures exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you can use the following approach:
- If \( n = k \), output an array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1, 1, ..., 1]`).
- If \( k = 1 \), output a strictly increasing sequence (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`).
- If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \), construct an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order, and the remaining \( n - k \) elements are all equal to the \( k \)-th element. This ensures that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            print(*[1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k >= 2:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(k)] + [k for j in range(n - k)])
        else:
            print('-1')

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
