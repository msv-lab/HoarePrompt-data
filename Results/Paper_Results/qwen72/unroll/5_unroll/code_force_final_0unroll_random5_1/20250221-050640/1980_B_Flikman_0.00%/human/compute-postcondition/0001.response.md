The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial state is not relevant since it will be overwritten by the loop.

Given this, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the conditions for `t` are already met. However, for clarity, we can restate the necessary conditions for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is not relevant before the loop starts**
