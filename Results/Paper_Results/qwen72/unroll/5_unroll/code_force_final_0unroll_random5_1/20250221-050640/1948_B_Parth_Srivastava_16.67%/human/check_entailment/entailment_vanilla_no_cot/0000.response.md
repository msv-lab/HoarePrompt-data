Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**:
   - The program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them back into the array. However, it does not handle the case where the digits of a number need to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the order of the array. Instead, it simply appends the digits to the end of the list `c`, which is incorrect.

2. **Logical Errors in Conditions**:
   - The conditions for splitting the digits and appending them to `c` are not comprehensive. For example, the program checks if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x` before appending the digits, but this does not ensure that the array will be sorted after the operation.
   - The program does not handle the case where the digits of a number need to be inserted in the middle of the array to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the array `c` is sorted by comparing it to `sorted(c)`. This is a valid check, but it is performed after the incorrect digit insertion logic, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them in the correct position to maintain the sorted order.
2. Check if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_array(a):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] >= 10:
            digits = split_number(a[i])
            a.pop(i)
            a[i:i] = digits
    
    return a == sorted(a)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append('YES' if can_sort_array(a) else 'NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `split_number`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns a list of its digits.

2. **Function `can_sort_array`**:
   - This function iterates through the array and splits any number greater than or equal to 10 into its digits.
   - The digits are inserted back into the array at the correct position to maintain the order.
   - After all possible splits, the function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calls the `can_sort_array` function for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operations.
