### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is done efficiently using a loop and the `get` method to update the counts.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - This is correct because if there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 out of them is given by the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3}\).

4. **Calculating Mixed Combinations**:
   - The program also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
   - Here, `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.
   - This is correct because if there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 2 out of them is \(\binom{cnt}{2}\), and for each of these pairs, there are `total_sum` ways to choose the third stick from the remaining sticks.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of valid combinations.

6. **Triangle Inequality**:
   - The program implicitly handles the triangle inequality by only considering combinations where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
   - For sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if there are at least two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, or three sticks of the same length. This is because the lengths are powers of 2, and the sum of any two smaller powers of 2 is always less than the next higher power of 2.
   - However, the program does not explicitly check the triangle inequality for the mixed combinations. It assumes that if there are two sticks of the same length and one of a different length, they can form a triangle. This assumption is correct for the given problem constraints because the lengths are powers of 2, and the sum of two smaller powers of 2 is always greater than the next smaller power of 2.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length, which is \(O(n)\) for each test case.
   - The combination calculations are also efficient, as they are done in constant time for each count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement. The implicit handling of the triangle inequality is valid for the given problem constraints.

Final: **True**
