The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `low + 1` must be less than `high`, which means `1 < n`.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1. `st` is an empty set.**
