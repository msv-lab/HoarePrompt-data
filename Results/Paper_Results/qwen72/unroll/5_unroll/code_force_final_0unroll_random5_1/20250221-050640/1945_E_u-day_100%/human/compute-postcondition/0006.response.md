Output State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`. `st` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes an empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `pos`, `n`, `k`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the initial state remains valid, with the addition of `st` being an empty set.
