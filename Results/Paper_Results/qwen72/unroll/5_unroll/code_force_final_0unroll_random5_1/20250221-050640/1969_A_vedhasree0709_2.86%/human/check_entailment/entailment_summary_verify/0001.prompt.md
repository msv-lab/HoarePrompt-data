You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` of length `n`. It checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+1) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come.
   - Each friend \( i \) will come if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of invitations sent.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list \( l \) of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list \( l \) to check for a specific condition: if \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \).
   - If this condition is met, it prints 2 and sets a flag \( j \) to 1, breaking out of the loop.
   - If the condition is never met, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - The condition \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \) checks if there is a pair of friends \( (i, i+1) \) such that \( i \)'s best friend is \( i+2 \) and \( i+1 \)'s best friend is \( i+1 \).
   - This condition is not general enough to solve the problem. It only checks for a very specific pattern and does not consider other valid pairs or cycles in the best friend relationships.

4. **General Solution Approach:**
   - The problem can be solved by finding the smallest cycle in the best friend relationships. A cycle is a sequence of friends where each friend's best friend is the next friend in the sequence, and the last friend's best friend is the first friend.
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, Monocarp only needs to send 2 invitations.
   - If there is no cycle of length 2, Monocarp needs to send at least 3 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program does not correctly identify cycles in the best friend relationships.
   - It only checks for a very specific pattern and will fail to find the correct minimum number of invitations in many cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider other valid pairs or cycles in the best friend relationships.
