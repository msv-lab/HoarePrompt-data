t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of friends; the second line contains a list of integers p of length n, where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct.
