The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each containing two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers `n` and `m`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not described in the output section. Given the constraints, the function likely processes the lists `a_i` and `b_i` in some way and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and the integers in the lists are between `1` and `10^9`. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
