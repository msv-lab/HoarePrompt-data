The only variable in the loop head is the anonymous variable `_`, which is used to iterate over a range. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, the value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This value is used to determine the number of test cases, and it is the value that will be passed to `range(int(input()))`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `int(input())` must be at least 1. Since `t` is the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `int(input())` must be `t` which is at least 1.**
