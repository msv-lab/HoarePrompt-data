You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a` and `c` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `a` equal by either increasing or decreasing elements in `a` using elements from `c`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are already equal, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and if the single element in both arrays is equal. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero. This is a valid special case check.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `c` in descending order. This is a key step in the algorithm to maximize the total difference `D`.

4. **Single Element Handling:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference between this element and the elements in `c` (either the maximum or minimum element in `c`). This is correct because for a single element, the maximum difference is achieved by choosing the most extreme value from `c`.

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the sorted arrays `a` and `c`.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the difference with the corresponding elements in `c` (one from the start and one from the end) and chooses the maximum of these differences.
   - The pointer `i` is incremented if the difference with the start element is smaller, and the pointer `j` is incremented if the difference with the end element is larger.
   - The total difference `ans` is accumulated by adding the maximum difference at each step.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order helps in maximizing the difference between corresponding elements. This is because the largest elements in `c` will be paired with the smallest elements in `a`, and vice versa, which maximizes the absolute differences.

- **Pointer Logic:**
  - The logic of using two pointers to choose the maximum difference at each step is correct. By comparing the differences with the start and end elements of `c`, the program ensures that it always selects the pair that maximizes the difference.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the special case where all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal.
  - It also handles the case where `a` has only one element by choosing the most extreme value from `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps. It correctly handles all edge cases and uses an efficient algorithm to maximize the total difference `D`.

### Correctness:
**True**
