Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The loop has processed all test cases and printed the required output for each test case. The lists a and c are sorted (a in ascending order and c in descending order) for each test case, and the indices i and j are updated accordingly during the loop execution. The variable ans is the accumulated maximum absolute difference for each test case and is reset to 0 for the next test case.**
