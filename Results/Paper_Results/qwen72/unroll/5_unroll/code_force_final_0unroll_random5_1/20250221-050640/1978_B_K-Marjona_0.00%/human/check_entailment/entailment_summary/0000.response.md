Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program correctly prints `a * n`. This is because if the modified price `b` is not higher than the usual price `a`, there is no benefit in selling any buns at the modified price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation**: The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the correct approach because:
   - `k` should not exceed `n` (the number of buns).
   - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would drop below the usual price `a`, which would not be optimal.

4. **Profit Calculation**: The profit calculation for the case where `b > a` is:
   - For the first `k` buns, the profit is the sum of the modified prices: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
   - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the profit is the usual price: `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`.

5. **Formula Explanation**: The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`. This is the correct way to compute the total profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - When `n` is very large and `b` is very large, the program correctly calculates the profit.
   - When `b` is equal to `a`, the program correctly prints `a * n`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct profit for each test case, as verified by the example outputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
