The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we can describe the general functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.**
