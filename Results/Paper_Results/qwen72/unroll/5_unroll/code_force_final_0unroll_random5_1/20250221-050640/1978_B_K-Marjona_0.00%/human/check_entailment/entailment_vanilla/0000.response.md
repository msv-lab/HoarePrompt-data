### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would be less or equal to `a`.
   - If `b > a`, Bob should consider selling the first `k` buns at the modified price to maximize profit. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would result in prices less than `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price plus the prices of the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k // 2\).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, it calculates the profit using the formula \((b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k // 2 + (n - k) \cdot a\) and prints the result.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price using the arithmetic series formula.
   - The program correctly adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
