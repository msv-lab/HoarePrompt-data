The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `inf` and the list `values` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0**
