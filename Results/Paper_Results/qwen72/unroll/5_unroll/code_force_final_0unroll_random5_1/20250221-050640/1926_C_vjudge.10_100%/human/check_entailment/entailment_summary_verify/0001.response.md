### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these results.
   - For each test case, the input \( n \) is an integer between 1 and \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) in an array `values`.
   - This precomputation is done once, and then for each test case, it retrieves the precomputed result in constant time.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - The array `values` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each number \( i \) from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \):
     - The sum of the digits of \( i \) is calculated by converting \( i \) to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
     - The cumulative sum of digit sums is stored in `values[i]` as `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read from input.
   - For each test case, the value \( n \) is read, and the precomputed result `values[n]` is printed.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(2 \cdot 10^5 \cdot \log(2 \cdot 10^5)) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - Each test case is handled in \( O(1) \) time, which is very fast and within the 0.5 seconds limit.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
   - The cumulative sum is stored correctly.
   - The results for each test case are retrieved and printed correctly.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
- It precomputes a list `values` where each element at index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
- For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `value` from the input, and prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Precomputation**:
  - The loop `for i in range(1, inf):` correctly iterates from 1 to 200000.
  - The inner loop `for x in str(i):` correctly converts the integer \( i \) to a string and sums its digits.
  - The cumulative sum is stored in `values[i]` as `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, which is correct.

- **Handling Test Cases**:
  - The loop `for _ in range(t):` correctly handles the number of test cases.
  - The value \( n \) is read and the precomputed result `values[n]` is printed, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient for the given problem and constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
