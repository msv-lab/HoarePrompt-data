### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these results.
   - For each test case, the input \( n \) is an integer between 1 and \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) in an array `values`.
   - This precomputation is done once, and then for each test case, it retrieves the precomputed result in constant time.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - The array `values` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each number \( i \) from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \):
     - The sum of the digits of \( i \) is calculated by converting \( i \) to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
     - The cumulative sum of digit sums is stored in `values[i]` as `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read from input.
   - For each test case, the value \( n \) is read, and the precomputed result `values[n]` is printed.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(2 \cdot 10^5 \cdot \log(2 \cdot 10^5)) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - Each test case is handled in \( O(1) \) time, which is very fast and within the 0.5 seconds limit.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
   - The cumulative sum is stored correctly.
   - The results for each test case are retrieved and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient for the given problem and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
