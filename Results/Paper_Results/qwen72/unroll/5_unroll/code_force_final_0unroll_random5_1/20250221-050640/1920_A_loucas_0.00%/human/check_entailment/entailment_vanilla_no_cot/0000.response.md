Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. Specifically, the program only checks for the first valid integer `k` that meets the constraints and prints it, instead of counting all such integers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        big = []
        less = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        
        # Find the minimum value k must be greater than or equal to
        min_k = max(big)
        
        # Find the maximum value k must be less than or equal to
        max_k = min(less)
        
        # Count the number of valid k values
        num = max_k - min_k + 1 - len([x for x in no if min_k <= x <= max_k])
        
        print(num)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the constraints for each test case.
2. **Constraints Collection**: The program collects the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1, `less` for constraints of type 2, and `no` for constraints of type 3.
3. **Range Calculation**:
   - `min_k` is set to the maximum value in the `big` list, which is the smallest value `k` can be.
   - `max_k` is set to the minimum value in the `less` list, which is the largest value `k` can be.
4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[min_k, max_k]` using `max_k - min_k + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of integers in the `no` set that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

This corrected version will correctly count and print the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.
