The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number of constraints, categorizes them into three lists (`big`, `less`, `no`), and finds the first integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, less than the minimum value in `less`, and not present in `no`. If no such integer exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The input variables `t` and `n` are not modified by the function.
