Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code snippets (`func_1` and `func_2`) are incomplete and do not cover the full problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The code only includes functions to move entities and to handle player eliminations. It lacks the logic to handle scoring, catching the Quaffle, and moving the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal.

2. **Missing State Management**: The code does not manage the state of the game, such as the positions of the players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, or the scores of the teams.

3. **Handling of Actions**: The code does not handle the actions described in the problem (e.g., catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and scoring goals).

4. **Final Score Output**: The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Event Printing**: The code does not print the events in the required format (e.g., "t RED GOAL", "t BLUE GOAL", "t p ELIMINATED").

Given these missing components, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
