Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). If `d` is 'D', the first integer in `obj` (obj[0]) is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer in `obj` (obj[1]) is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer in `obj` (obj[1]) is incremented by 1. The direction `d` is not 'U' and retains its original value.***
