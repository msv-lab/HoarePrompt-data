### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes lists for the red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), and the bludger (`blud`).
   - It reads the initial state of the field, correctly identifying the positions of goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players.
   - The initial position of the Quaffle is stored in `ball`.
   - The initial positions of the players are stored in the `player` dictionary.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of steps (`T`) and processes each step.
   - For each step, it reads the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - **Catching the Quaffle:**
     - If the action is `C` (catch), the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle:**
     - If the action is `T` (throw), the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to `None` (indicating no player is carrying the Quaffle).
     - It checks if the Quaffle is at a goal position and updates the score accordingly.
     - It correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - **Moving Entities:**
     - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to update the position.
     - If the entity is a player, it calls `func_1` to update the player's position and then `func_2` to check for eliminations.
     - If the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to match the player's new position.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly updates the position of the entity based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - The function ensures that the entity's position is updated correctly for each direction.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger.
   - If a player is in the same position as the Bludger, it is eliminated by setting the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.
   - The function correctly prints the elimination event for each eliminated player in alphabetical order.

5. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the steps, the program correctly prints the final score.

### Issues:
- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger.
  - However, it does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. The problem description states that if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. The program does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct, but it does not handle the specific case of a player being eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. This could lead to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs to be modified to handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, ensuring that the Quaffle remains on the cell where the player was eliminated.
