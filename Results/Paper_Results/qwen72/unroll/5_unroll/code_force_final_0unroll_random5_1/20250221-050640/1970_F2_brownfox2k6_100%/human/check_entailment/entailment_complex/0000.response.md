Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to simulate a simplified version of a Quidditch match, focusing on the scoring and elimination of players by a Bludger. Let's break down the components and their correctness:

1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (N, M) and initializes the positions of goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and players. This part seems to correctly parse the input and store the initial positions.

2. **Handling Actions:**
   - The program processes T actions, where each action is either a movement (U, D, L, R), catching the Quaffle (C), or throwing the Quaffle (T).
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for moving entities (players, Quaffle, Bludger) on the field. It correctly updates the coordinates based on the direction provided.
   - The `func_2` function checks if any player is eliminated by the Bludger. It correctly identifies and eliminates players, and prints the elimination event.

3. **Scoring and Ball Reset:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the ball is at a goal of the opposing team. If so, it increments the score for the appropriate team and prints the scoring event.
   - The Quaffle is then reset to the middle of the field, which is correctly calculated as `[n // 2, m // 2]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the scoring and elimination events as required.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

However, there are a few potential issues and edge cases to consider:

- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger, but it does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem statement, if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger. The current implementation does not account for this.

- **Multiple Entities on the Same Cell:**
  - The program does not handle the case where multiple entities (players, Quaffle, Bludger) can be on the same cell. For example, if a player moves to a cell where the Quaffle is already present, the program should allow the player to catch the Quaffle. Similarly, if a player moves to a cell where the Bludger is present, the player should be eliminated. The current implementation does not explicitly handle these interactions.

- **Scoring in the Wrong Goal:**
  - The program correctly handles scoring in the wrong goal by awarding the point to the opposing team. However, it does not explicitly check if the player is on the same cell as the goal before scoring. This should be ensured to avoid any potential bugs.

Given these considerations, the program is mostly correct but has a few edge cases that are not fully handled. Specifically, the handling of the Quaffle when a player is eliminated while carrying it is missing.

Correctness: **False**
