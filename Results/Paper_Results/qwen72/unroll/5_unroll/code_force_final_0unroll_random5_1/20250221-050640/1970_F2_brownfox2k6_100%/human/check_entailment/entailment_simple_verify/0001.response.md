### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch on a grid with specific rules for moving players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team, and scoring in one's own goal gives a point to the opponent.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include all events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(obj, d)`:**
     - This function correctly updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
     - It modifies the position of the entity in place.
     - The function seems to correctly handle the movement of entities.

   - **Function `func_2(t)`:**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
     - The function sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing the events, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program initializes the field and entities correctly.
   - It reads the initial state of the field and stores the positions of goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and players.
   - The program then processes each action step by step.
   - It correctly handles the movement of the Quaffle and the Bludger using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles the movement of players and checks for eliminations using `func_2`.
   - It correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - It correctly updates the score based on the goal conditions.
   - It prints the appropriate events (goals and eliminations) at the correct times.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code assumes that the input is valid and does not include any error handling for invalid inputs.
   - The code does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, but the problem guarantees that this will not happen.
   - The code correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code, including the main program and the functions, correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem.
   - The code handles all the necessary actions and events, including movement, catching, throwing, scoring, and elimination.
   - The output format is consistent with the problem requirements.
   - Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
