You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The variables `P` and `M` are reset to 0 for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in the string corresponds to an element in an array `a` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` maps to `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of `+` and `-` characters, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string, incrementing `P` for `+` and `M` for `-`.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string.
   - However, the program does not actually calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem.
   - The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.
   - The program simply prints the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which does not correspond to the penalty calculation required by the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `+`, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `1` (as the sum of the subarray `[1]` is `1` and its length is `1`).
   - For the input `-----`, the program outputs `-5`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `5` (as the sum of each subarray `[-1]` is `-1` and its length is `1`).
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `0` (as the sum of each subarray `[1, -1]` is `0` and its length is `2`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem. It only calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the penalty calculation.
