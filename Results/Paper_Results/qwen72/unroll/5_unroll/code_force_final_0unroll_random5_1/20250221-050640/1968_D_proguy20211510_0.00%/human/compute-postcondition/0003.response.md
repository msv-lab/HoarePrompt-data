The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the input value provided to the `range` function. For the loop to execute, the input value must be greater than 0. The input value is expected to be the number of test cases `t`, which is already defined in the state as being between 1 and 10^4. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be at least 1 (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
