The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the maximum value in `a` and the positions `P_B` and `P_S`. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya wins, 'Sasha' if Sasha wins, or 'Draw' if the game is a draw. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the results have been printed.
