Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where a player can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. Instead, the program seems to assume that players will always move to the position specified by the permutation, which is not always the optimal strategy.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
In this case:
- Bodya starts at position 3.
- Sasha starts at position 2.

The permutation is `p = [4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array is `a = [7, 2, 5, 6]`.

The optimal strategy for both players would be:
- Bodya: Stay at position 3 on both turns, scoring 5 + 5 = 10.
- Sasha: Move to position 1 on the first turn, scoring 2 + 7 = 9.

However, the program will incorrectly simulate the game by always moving the players according to the permutation, which would result in:
- Bodya: Moves to position 2 on the first turn, scoring 5 + 2 = 7.
- Sasha: Moves to position 1 on the first turn, scoring 2 + 7 = 9.

Thus, the program will incorrectly determine that Sasha wins, when in fact Bodya should win if both players play optimally.
