Output State: **The function `func` will have processed all test cases and printed the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` will have been updated and used during the loop execution, but their final values will be irrelevant as they are reset for each test case. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the function will have finished executing.**
