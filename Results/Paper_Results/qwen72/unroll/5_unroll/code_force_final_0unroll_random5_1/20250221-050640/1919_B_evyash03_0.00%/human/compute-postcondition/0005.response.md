The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` is equal to the length of `expression`.

The function returns the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration of the expression, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of times the balance went below 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`. It returns the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration of the expression, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns only the number of times the balance went below 0.**
