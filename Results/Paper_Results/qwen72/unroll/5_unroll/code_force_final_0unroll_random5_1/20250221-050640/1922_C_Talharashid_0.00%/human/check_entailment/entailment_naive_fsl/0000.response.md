Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are not uniformly spaced, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the program assumes that the closest city is always the next or previous city in the list, which is not always true. For example, consider the cities located at points [0, 1, 3, 10, 12]. According to the problem, the closest city to city 3 (at point 3) should be city 4 (at point 10), but the program will incorrectly choose city 2 (at point 1) as the closest city, leading to incorrect minimum coin calculations.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum number of coins required for each query. The logic for calculating the minimum coins using `d1` and `d2` dictionaries is flawed, as it does not account for the possibility of traveling to the closest city multiple times or directly to the target city if it is closer.

For example, with the input:
```
1
5
0 1 3 10 12
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```
The program will produce incorrect results for some queries.
