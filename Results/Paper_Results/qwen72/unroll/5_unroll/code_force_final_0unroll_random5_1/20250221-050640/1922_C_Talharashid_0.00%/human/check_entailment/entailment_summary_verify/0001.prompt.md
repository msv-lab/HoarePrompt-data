You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum distance between the two specified cities by considering the distances in both forward and backward directions. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the variables used within the function are no longer in their initial states, but their final states are not explicitly defined.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `lst`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum cost to travel from the start city to any other city in the list.
   - It calculates the minimum cost to travel from the first city to the last city and vice versa. This is done by iterating from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively.
   - For each city, it determines the minimum distance to its adjacent cities and updates the cost accordingly.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the list of cities from the start to the end and from the end to the start, updating the cost in `d1` and `d2` dictionaries.
   - The cost is incremented by 1 if the closest city is the next adjacent city, otherwise, it is incremented by the actual distance.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the start and end cities, adjusts their indices to be 0-based, and calculates the minimum cost to travel between them.
   - It uses the precomputed costs in `d1` and `d2` to determine the minimum cost by comparing the costs of traveling in both directions.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each query.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
  - The program uses a fixed large number `11111111` to initialize `mini`. This is not necessary and can be misleading if the actual distances are larger.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the start city is the first or last city in the list. It should only consider valid adjacent cities.

- **Cost Calculation Logic**:
  - The logic for updating the cost in the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` is incorrect. It should not use `abs` when calculating the difference in costs.
  - The program should store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start and end, respectively, without taking the absolute value.

- **Query Handling**:
  - The program should directly use the precomputed costs in `d1` and `d2` without taking the absolute value of the differences.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
