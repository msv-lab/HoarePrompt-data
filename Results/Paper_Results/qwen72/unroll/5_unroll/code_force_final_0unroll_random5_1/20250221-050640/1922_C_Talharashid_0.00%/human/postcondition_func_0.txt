The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum distance between the two specified cities by considering the distances in both forward and backward directions. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the variables used within the function are no longer in their initial states, but their final states are not explicitly defined.
