The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer representing the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
  - `m`: an integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
  - `queries`: a list of `m` pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries, where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the distance between the closest city to the city at index `x_i` and the city at index `y_i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their coordinates in ascending order, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It returns a list of distances, where each distance is the distance between the closest city to the city at index `x_i` and the city at index `y_i` for each query.**
