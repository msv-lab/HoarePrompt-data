### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It calls the function `func_1(a, n)` to compute the maximum score you can achieve.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - The function creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - **Calculating Maximum Score:**
     - It iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` and increments `max_score` for each integer that appears exactly twice in your hand.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The function returns `max_score`, which is the count of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.

4. **Optimal Play by Nene:**
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - If you have a card with an integer `x` that appears exactly twice in your hand, Nene will not play her card with the same integer `x` until you play both of yours. This is because playing her card with `x` would allow you to score a point.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, as Nene will block you from scoring any additional points for those integers.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice, which is the maximum number of points you can score under optimal play by Nene.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given the constraints and the optimal play by Nene.
