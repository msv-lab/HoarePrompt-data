### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases in a single read. The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`. The subsequent elements are the test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program:
   - Reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - Counts the number of "U" (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - Determines the winner based on the parity of the count of "U" coins:
     - If the count of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win.
     - If the count of "U" coins is even, Bob will win.

3. **Winning Condition**: The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of facing-up coins:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that she is the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that he is the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no facing-up coins, which results in a loss for the player whose turn it is.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which does not affect the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if Alice will win and "NO" if Bob will win, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It processes the input efficiently and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
