To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - Therefore, `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is the length of `arr` and `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, `n` must be at least 2 for the condition to be true.
   - So, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr[i]` is the first element of the list.
   - `arr[i + 1]` is the second element of the list.
   - For the loop to execute, the first element of `arr` must be equal to the second element of `arr`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and the first element of `arr` is equal to the second element of `arr`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1; `j` is equal to `n` - 1; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
