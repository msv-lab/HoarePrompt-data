### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices `a` and `b` for Alice and Bob, respectively, using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices `a` are negated to facilitate the use of a min-heap for Alice's prices.
   - The items are stored in a list `arr` as tuples `[a[i], b[i]]`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on Bob's prices `b[i]` in ascending order. This is done to ensure that Bob can take the least profitable items for himself (i.e., the items with the smallest `b[i]` values).

4. **Heap Operations**:
   - A min-heap `k_arr` is used to keep track of the `k` items that Bob can take for free.
   - The program pushes the last `k` items from `arr` into `k_arr` and removes them from `arr`.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_3` is called to calculate the initial profit `sub_sum` by summing the Alice's prices in `k_arr` and adding the sum of `a[i] + b[i]` for items in `arr` where the sum is non-negative.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining items in `arr`, adjusting the profit by removing the least profitable item from `k_arr` and adding the current item to `k_arr` if it is more profitable.
   - The maximum profit `max_value` is updated if the current profit `sub_sum` is greater.

6. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit `max_value` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Negation of `a`**: The negation of `a` is incorrect. Alice's prices should be used as they are, and the heap should be a max-heap to keep track of the most profitable items for Alice.
- **Heap Operations**: The use of `heapq.heappushpop` is incorrect because `heapq` is a min-heap by default. The program should use a max-heap to keep track of the most profitable items for Alice.
- **Profit Calculation**: The profit calculation in `func_3` is incorrect. The function should calculate the profit based on the correct logic of Alice's and Bob's prices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import heapq
import sys

putin = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(putin())

def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[1]  # Sum of Bob's prices for the items in sec_arr
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[1] - val_b[0] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[1] - val_b[0]  # Sum of Bob's prices minus Alice's prices for items in main_ar
    return sub_summ

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = func_1()
    for x in range(t):
        arr = []
        k_arr = []
        (n, k) = func_2()
        a = list(func_2())
        b = list(func_2())
        max_value = 0
        for i in range(n):
            arr.append([a[i], b[i]])
        arr.sort(key=lambda y: y[1] - y[0], reverse=True)  # Sort by Bob's profit minus Alice's cost
        for k_range in range(k):
            if arr:
                heapq.heappush(k_arr, [-(arr[-1][1] - arr[-1][0]), arr[-1][1]])  # Use a max-heap for Bob's profit minus Alice's cost
                arr.pop()
        if arr:
            sub_sum = func_3(arr, k_arr)
        if sub_sum > max_value:
            max_value = sub_sum
        while arr:
            sub_sum -= k_arr[0][1]  # Remove the least profitable item Bob can take for free
            heapq.heappop(k_arr)
            if arr:
                sub_sum += arr[-1][1] - arr[-1][0]  # Add the current item's profit
                heapq.heappush(k_arr, [-(arr[-1][1] - arr[-1][0]), arr[-1][1]])
                arr.pop()
            if sub_sum > max_value:
                max_value = sub_sum
        print(max_value)
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has several logical and implementation issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.
