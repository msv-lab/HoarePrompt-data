To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and the initial conditions.

### Initial State:
- `main_ar` remains unchanged.
- `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`.
2. For each tuple, it checks if the sum of the first and second elements (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0.
3. If the condition is true, it adds the sum of the first and second elements to `sub_summ`.

### Output State:
- `main_ar` remains unchanged.
- `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
- `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`main_ar` remains unchanged, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.**
