The function `inp()` is used to read input data for the problem, but the specific structure and validation of the input data (such as the number of test cases, the values of n and k, and the lists of integers a_i and b_i) are not defined within the function itself. The input data should follow the format specified in the problem description, with t test cases, each containing integers n and k, followed by two lists of n integers each, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
