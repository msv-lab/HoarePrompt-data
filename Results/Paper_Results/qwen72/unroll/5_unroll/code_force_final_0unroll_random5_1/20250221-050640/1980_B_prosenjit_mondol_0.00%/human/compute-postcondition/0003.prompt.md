You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases)`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes. Each `n` is the number of cubes, `f` is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, `k` is the number of cubes to be removed, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100. Additionally, 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on the input. The value `x` is set to the value of the cube at index `f-1` in the list `a`. The list `a` is then sorted in descending order. The loop checks if the value of the cube at index `k-1` in the sorted list `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `x` and prints 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. After all iterations, the variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (number of cubes), `f` (index of Dmitry's favorite cube), `k` (number of cubes to be removed), and `a` (list of integers representing the values on the cubes). The function returns a list of strings, where each string is "Yes" if it is possible to remove exactly `k` cubes while keeping Dmitry's favorite cube, or "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
