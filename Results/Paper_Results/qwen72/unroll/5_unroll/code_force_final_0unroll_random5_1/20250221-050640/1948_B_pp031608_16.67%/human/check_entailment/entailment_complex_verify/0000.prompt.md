You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to the sorted list `sorted_lst`. If `lst` was already sorted in ascending order, the program returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that it only attempts to split the elements in the array once, and it does so in a sequential manner. This means that if the first element is greater than 10 and needs to be split, but the resulting array still isn't sorted after the split, the program won't attempt to split any other elements that might need it. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]
```
This array is already sorted, so the program will print "Yes" correctly.

However, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 56 45
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 56, 45]
```
This array is not sorted, so the program will attempt to split the next element (56) and insert the digits:
```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 45]
```
This array is still not sorted, and the program will print "No" without attempting to split the 45, which could potentially make the array sorted.

Another issue is that the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single test case. For example:
```
1
3
12 34 56
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 34, 56]
```
After the second split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 56]
```
After the third split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
This array is sorted, but the program will not attempt to split all elements and will likely print "No" prematurely.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
