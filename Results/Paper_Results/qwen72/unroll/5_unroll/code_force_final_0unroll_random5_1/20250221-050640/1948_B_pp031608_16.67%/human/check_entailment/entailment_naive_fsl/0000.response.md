Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that it only attempts to split the elements in the array once, and it does so in a sequential manner. This means that if the first element is greater than 10 and needs to be split, but the resulting array still isn't sorted after the split, the program won't attempt to split any other elements that might need it. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]
```
This array is already sorted, so the program will print "Yes" correctly.

However, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 56 45
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 56, 45]
```
This array is not sorted, so the program will attempt to split the next element (56) and insert the digits:
```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 45]
```
This array is still not sorted, and the program will print "No" without attempting to split the 45, which could potentially make the array sorted.

Another issue is that the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single test case. For example:
```
1
3
12 34 56
```
After the first split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 34, 56]
```
After the second split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 56]
```
After the third split, the array becomes:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
This array is sorted, but the program will not attempt to split all elements and will likely print "No" prematurely.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
