### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if a given array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if it can be sorted by applying the operation.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous element can be sorted by splitting the previous element if it is greater than 10.
   - If the array can be sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than the previous element.
   - If the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - However, the program only performs this operation once per iteration, which is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be fully sorted if multiple elements need to be split.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not check if the array can be sorted after each split operation, which means it might miss opportunities to sort the array correctly.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of splitting elements that are not adjacent to the current element being checked.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - After splitting 12, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
     - The program correctly prints 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
     - The array cannot be sorted by splitting any element.
     - The program correctly prints 'No'.
   - **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
     - The array is already sorted.
     - The program correctly prints 'Yes'.

However, consider a more complex test case:
   - **Test Case 4**: `[12, 34, 56, 78]`
     - The array can be sorted by splitting 34 into `[3, 4]`, resulting in `[12, 3, 4, 56, 78]`.
     - The program might not correctly handle this case because it only performs one split operation per iteration.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
