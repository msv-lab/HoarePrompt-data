The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, because the range for `i` is from 1 to `n - 1`, which means the loop will run for `i` values from 1 to `n - 2`.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, but it will start at 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`list` is a list of integers of length n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1**
