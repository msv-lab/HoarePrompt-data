### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation: for an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)), the operation is:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - The goal is to check if all elements can be reduced to zero.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works as intended.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to apply the operations to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it performs the operation while \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed as follows:
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
   - This is incorrect because it multiplies the decrement by `list[i-1]`, which is not what the problem description specifies. The correct operation should be:
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 \)
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 \)
   - The check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is also problematic. It prints "no" and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is not a valid condition for the problem. The operation should only be performed when all three elements are positive, and the function should continue to check the entire array after performing the operations.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the loop in `func_2` is intended to perform the operation on the middle elements of the list.
   - However, the operation is incorrectly implemented, leading to potential negative values in the array.
   - The check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can cause the function to return prematurely without checking the entire array.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should only perform the operation when \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - After performing the operation, it should check if the array can be made zero using `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description, and it can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed. Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Final: **False**
