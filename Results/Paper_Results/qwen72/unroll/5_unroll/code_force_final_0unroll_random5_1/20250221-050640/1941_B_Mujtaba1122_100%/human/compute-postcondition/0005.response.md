Based on the initial state provided:

1. The list is modified such that for each index \( i \) (where \( 1 \leq i < n - 1 \)):
   - If `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` were greater than 0, then:
     - `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]` are reduced to 0.
     - `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]`.
   - If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state.
2. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

Given the precondition, the list is in a state where no index \( i \) (where \( 1 \leq i < n - 1 \)) has `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the state of the list or any other variables, because it is a simple string literal.

Output: **NO**
