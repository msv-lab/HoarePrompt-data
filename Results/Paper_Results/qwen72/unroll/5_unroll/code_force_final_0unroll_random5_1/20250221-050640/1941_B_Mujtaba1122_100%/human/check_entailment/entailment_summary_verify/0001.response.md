### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations are:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - These operations can only be applied to indices \( i \) where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to apply the operations to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - The operation is performed as follows:
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
   - This implementation is incorrect because it multiplies the decrement by `list[i-1]`, which is not what the problem description specifies.
   - The correct operation should be:
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 \)
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 \)
   - The current implementation can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.
   - Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed since the operation should only be performed when all three elements are positive.

4. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`.
   - The incorrect operation can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed.
   - The unnecessary check `if list[i-1] != 0:` can cause the function to terminate prematurely, even if the operation could still be applied correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description, and it can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed. Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
