You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that for each index `i` (1 <= i < n - 1), if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]` are reduced to 0, and `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]`. If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not 0, the function prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state. If the loop completes without encountering this condition, the function calls `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Rudolf can choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and perform the operation:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using these operations.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to apply the operations to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it performs the operation while \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed as follows:
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
   - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns.
   - After attempting to apply the operations, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The operation in `func_2` is incorrect. The correct operation should be:
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 \)
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 \)
   - The current implementation multiplies the decrement by `list[i-1]`, which is not what the problem description specifies.
   - This incorrect operation can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.
   - Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is not necessary and can be removed since the operation should only be performed when all three elements are positive.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should only perform the operation when \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - After performing the operation, it should check if the array can be made zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description, and it can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed. Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed.
