### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Operation Simulation**:
   - The problem description specifies that the operation should decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, in the `func_2` function, the implementation uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The current implementation:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This means that `list[i + 1]` is decremented by the value of `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` is decremented by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` is decremented by its own value. This is not the same as the specified operation.

2. **Handling the Case Where the Array is Already All Zeros**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros. In such a case, the program should immediately output "YES" without performing any operations.
   - The current implementation does not check for this condition at the beginning of `func_2`.

3. **Checking if the Array Can Be Made All Zeros**:
   - The program does not correctly check if the array can be made all zeros by the operations. The `func_1` function is used to check if all elements are zero, but the `func_2` function does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that can achieve this goal.
   - The `func_2` function only attempts to reduce elements at specific indices, but it does not consider the overall feasibility of making all elements zero.

### Example Analysis:

Let's analyze the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  5
  1 3 5 5 2
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program fails to output "YES" because it incorrectly simulates the operations. Here's what should happen:

1. **Initial Array**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
2. **First Operation (i=4)**:
   - `a[3] -= 1` → `5 - 1 = 4`
   - `a[4] -= 2` → `5 - 2 = 3`
   - `a[5] -= 1` → `2 - 1 = 1`
   - **Array**: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
3. **Second Operation (i=3)**:
   - `a[2] -= 1` → `4 - 1 = 3`
   - `a[3] -= 2` → `3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[4] -= 1` → `1 - 1 = 0`
   - **Array**: `[1, 3, 3, 1, 0]`
4. **Third Operation (i=2)**:
   - `a[1] -= 1` → `3 - 1 = 2`
   - `a[2] -= 2` → `3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] -= 1` → `1 - 1 = 0`
   - **Array**: `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`
5. **Fourth Operation (i=2)**:
   - `a[1] -= 1` → `2 - 1 = 1`
   - `a[2] -= 2` → `1 - 2 = -1` (This is not allowed as elements must be non-negative)
   - **Array**: `[1, 1, -1, 0, 0]` (Invalid state)

However, the correct sequence of operations should be:

1. **Initial Array**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
2. **First Operation (i=4)**:
   - `a[3] -= 1` → `5 - 1 = 4`
   - `a[4] -= 2` → `5 - 2 = 3`
   - `a[5] -= 1` → `2 - 1 = 1`
   - **Array**: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
3. **Second Operation (i=3)**:
   - `a[2] -= 1` → `4 - 1 = 3`
   - `a[3] -= 2` → `3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[4] -= 1` → `1 - 1 = 0`
   - **Array**: `[1, 3, 3, 1, 0]`
4. **Third Operation (i=2)**:
   - `a[1] -= 1` → `3 - 1 = 2`
   - `a[2] -= 2` → `3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] -= 1` → `1 - 1 = 0`
   - **Array**: `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`
5. **Fourth Operation (i=2)**:
   - `a[1] -= 1` → `2 - 1 = 1`
   - `a[2] -= 2` → `1 - 2 = -1` (This is not allowed as elements must be non-negative)
   - **Array**: `[1, 1, -1, 0, 0]` (Invalid state)

The program should correctly handle the operations and ensure that all elements are non-negative. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem and fails to produce the correct output for the given example.

Final: **False**
