Output State: **The color of the current vertex (`curr`) is now 2, the loop iterates through all neighbors (nei) of the current vertex (`curr`) in the graph, and for each neighbor, if the neighbor's color is not 2 and the neighbor is not the parent, the function `dfs` is called with the neighbor as the new current vertex, the current vertex as the new parent, and the current path appended with the neighbor. If the result of the `dfs` call (res) is not empty and contains the node `node_v`, the loop returns this result (res). If the loop completes all iterations without returning, the state remains unchanged: `curr` is still the current vertex, `parent` is still the parent vertex, `path` is still the current path with `curr` appended to it.**
