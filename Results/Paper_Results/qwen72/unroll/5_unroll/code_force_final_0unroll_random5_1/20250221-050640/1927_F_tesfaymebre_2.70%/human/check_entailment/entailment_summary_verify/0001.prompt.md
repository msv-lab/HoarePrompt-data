You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_1` to get a non-negative integer `test_cases` representing the number of test cases. Then, it iterates `test_cases` times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases processed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses functions to read input efficiently. `func_1` reads an integer, `func_2` reads a string, `func_3` reads multiple integers, and `func_4` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input for the number of test cases, the graph size, and the edges.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex is mapped to a list of its neighbors. This is a common and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph. The DSU is used to find and union sets, and it also keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each component.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle Path:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual path of the cycle. It uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited). If a node is revisited while it is being visited, a cycle is detected, and the path is returned.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cycle Detection in DSU:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the DSU when a cycle is detected. The line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` should not be called if `parent_u == parent_v` because it would incorrectly union the sets and potentially overwrite the minimum edge weight.

2. **DFS Path Return:**
   - The `dfs` function should return the path starting from the first occurrence of the cycle and ending at the current node. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and may return an incomplete or incorrect path.

3. **Cycle Path Construction:**
   - The `dfs` function should ensure that the path is constructed correctly and that it includes all nodes in the cycle. The current implementation may not do this correctly.

### Corrected Program:

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has issues in cycle detection and path construction. The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly find and print the simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
