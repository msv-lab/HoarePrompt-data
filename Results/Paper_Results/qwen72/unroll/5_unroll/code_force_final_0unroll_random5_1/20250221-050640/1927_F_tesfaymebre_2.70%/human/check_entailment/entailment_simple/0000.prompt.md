Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

However, the function relies on the existence of a `func_3()` function that returns pairs of integers (n, m) and triples of integers (u, v, w) representing the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the edges with their weights, respectively. The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, and `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is the weight of the edge between vertices u and v. The `DSU` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` for managing disjoint sets and tracking the minimum edge weight in each set.

If the result of the `dfs` call (res) is not empty and contains the node `node_v`, the loop returns this result (res). If the loop completes all iterations without returning, the state remains unchanged: curr is still the current vertex, parent is still the parent vertex, path is still the current path with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex (curr) is still 1.
