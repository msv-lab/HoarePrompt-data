Output State: **`n` and `m` retain their initial values, `graph` is updated to reflect the connected components after the loop execution, `edges` remains sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` has the nodes unionized based on the edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation, `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that were last unionized with the minimum edge weight, `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.**

The code initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
