### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Graph Construction:**
   - The function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3`.
   - It then reads each edge and constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list `edges` containing tuples of the form `(weight, u, v)`.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step in the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` nodes to handle 1-based indexing.
   - The `min_edge` array is used to keep track of the minimum edge weight for each component in the DSU.

3. **Union-Find with Edge Weight Tracking:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to unionize nodes.
   - If two nodes are already in the same component, it updates the minimum edge weight for that component.
   - The last edge that causes a union operation with the minimum edge weight is tracked (`node_u` and `node_v`).

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle Detection:**
   - The function `dfs` is used to find a cycle starting from `node_u` and `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node during the DFS traversal:
     - `0` for unvisited nodes.
     - `1` for nodes currently in the recursion stack.
     - `2` for visited nodes.
   - The function returns the path if a cycle is detected (i.e., if `node_v` is found in the path).

5. **Output:**
   - The function `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the cycle.
   - It also prints the nodes in the cycle.

6. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of test cases using `func_1`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_6` to process the graph and print the results.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Cycle Detection Logic:**
  - The cycle detection logic in `func_6` and `dfs` is not entirely correct. The function `dfs` should be designed to find a cycle that includes the edge with the minimum weight, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.
  - The condition `if colors[curr] == 1` is used to detect a cycle, but it does not ensure that the cycle includes the edge with the minimum weight.
  - The function `dfs` should be modified to ensure that it starts from the edge with the minimum weight and finds a cycle that includes this edge.

- **Edge Sorting:**
  - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is correct for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle. However, the logic for detecting and printing the cycle needs to be more robust.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly find and print a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The cycle detection logic in `dfs` needs to be improved to ensure that it starts from the edge with the minimum weight and finds a cycle that includes this edge.

Correctness: **False**
