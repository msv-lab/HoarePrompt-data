Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_1` to get a non-negative integer `test_cases` representing the number of test cases. Then, it iterates `test_cases` times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases processed. **
