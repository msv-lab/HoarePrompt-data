To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`.

1. **`num`**: This variable will be assigned the values from `numbers[1:]` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `num` does not need to be explicitly defined, as it will be set by the loop.

2. **`numbers`**: The loop will iterate over the slice `numbers[1:]`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements. This is because `numbers[1:]` will start from the second element of the list, and if there is no second element, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer represents a multiplier \( k_i \) such that \( 2 \le k_i \le 20 \).
- `result` is equal to the first integer in the `numbers` list.

We need to ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements for the loop to execute. The state of `num` will be the second element of `numbers` at the start of the loop.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers where each integer represents a multiplier \( k_i \) such that \( 2 \le k_i \le 20 \) and must have at least 2 elements, `result` is equal to the first integer in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second integer in the `numbers` list**
