The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned this integer value, which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
