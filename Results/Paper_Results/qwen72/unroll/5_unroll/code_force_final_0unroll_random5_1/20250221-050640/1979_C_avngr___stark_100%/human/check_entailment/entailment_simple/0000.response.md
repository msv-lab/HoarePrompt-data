### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, you receive \( k_i \times x_i \) coins, where \( x_i \) is the amount bet on outcome \( i \).
   - The total amount bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a function `func_2` to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers \( k_i \). This is done by iteratively computing the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list using the `func_1` function.
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets \( x_i \) are proportional to the multipliers \( k_i \) in a way that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The bets \( x_i \) are calculated as \( \text{LCM} // k_i \).

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`:** This function computes the LCM of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). This is correct.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`:** This function computes the LCM of a list of integers. It iterates through the list and uses `func_1` to compute the LCM. The final result is the LCM of all the multipliers \( k_i \). This is also correct.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then calculates the bets \( x_i \) as \( \text{LCM} // k_i \).
   - It checks if the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid and are printed. If not, it prints \(-1\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, the LCM will be \( k_i \). In this case, the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) will be \( n \times 1 \), which is equal to \( n \). Since \( n \) is not strictly less than \( k_i \) (which is \( k_i \)), the program correctly prints \(-1\).
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be a larger number, and the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) will be less than the LCM, ensuring a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for the given problem. It handles edge cases and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
