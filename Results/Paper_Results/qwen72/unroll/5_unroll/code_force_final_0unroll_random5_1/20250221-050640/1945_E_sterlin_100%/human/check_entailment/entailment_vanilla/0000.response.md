Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before applying binary search.
   - The binary search algorithm is used to find the position `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on Permutation**:
   - Binary search works efficiently on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we are applying it to a permutation, which is not sorted.
   - The goal is to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search will find `x` correctly.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The provided program does not contain the actual logic for rearranging the permutation or performing the binary search.
   - The program only contains a set of functions for reading input, which are `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a single integer, which is used to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads two integers, which are used to read `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads a list of integers, which is used to read the permutation `p` for each test case.

5. **Output**:
   - The program does not contain any logic to output the number of swaps or the indices of the swaps.
   - The functions `func_4` and `func_5` are not used in the program, and they do not contribute to the solution.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
