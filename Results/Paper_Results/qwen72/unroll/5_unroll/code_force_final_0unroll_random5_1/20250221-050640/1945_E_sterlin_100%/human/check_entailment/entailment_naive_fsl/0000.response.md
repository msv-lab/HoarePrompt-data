Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires a solution that performs binary search on a permutation after allowing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. However, the provided program only contains a series of input functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and does not include any logic for performing binary search, handling permutations, or performing swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
