The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element of an input string, split by spaces, into an integer. The input string is read from the standard input (e.g., user input or a redirected file). After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned iterator, which can be used to access the converted integers.
