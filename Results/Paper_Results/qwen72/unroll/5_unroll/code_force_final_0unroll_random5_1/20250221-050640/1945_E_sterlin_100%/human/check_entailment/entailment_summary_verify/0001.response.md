Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm is typically used on sorted arrays, but in this case, we need to ensure that the permutation can be rearranged to allow the binary search to find `x` correctly.

2. **Binary Search on Permutation**:
   - The key challenge is to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
   - The provided program does not contain any logic for rearranging the permutation or performing the binary search.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program only contains a set of functions for reading input, which are `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - These functions are used to read the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a single integer, which is used to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads two integers, which are used to read `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads a list of integers, which is used to read the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - `func_4` and `func_5` are not used in the provided program and do not contribute to the solution.

5. **Output**:
   - The program does not contain any logic to output the number of swaps or the indices of the swaps.
   - The functions `func_4` and `func_5` are not utilized, and their presence does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is indeed incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search.
   - Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
