### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - The element at `p[mid]` is checked against `x` to adjust `left` or `right`.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - An array `seen` is used to track which elements have been "seen" during the binary search.
   - After the binary search, if `p[left] == x`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` array, one swap is performed to move `x` to the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` array but not at `p[left]`, two swaps are performed to correct the position of `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The number of swaps `k` is printed.
   - If `k` is 1, the indices for the single swap are printed.
   - If `k` is 2, the indices for the two swaps are printed.

### Analysis:
- The binary search logic is correct for a sorted array, but the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted.
- The program attempts to rearrange the permutation using up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds `x`.
- The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is designed to handle the unsorted nature of the permutation.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `1 2 3 4 5 6`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The permutation is already sorted, and `x` is found at the correct position.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 5`, `3 1 6 5 2 4`
  - Output: `1`, `3 4`
  - Reason: Swapping `p[3]` and `p[4]` (1-based indexing) makes the permutation partially sorted enough for the binary search to find `x`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 1`, `3 5 4 2 1`
  - Output: `2`, `2 4`, `1 5`
  - Reason: Two swaps are needed to rearrange the permutation to a state where the binary search can find `x`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `4 3 1 5 2 6`
  - Output: `2`, `4 5`, `2 4`
  - Reason: Two swaps are needed to rearrange the permutation to a state where the binary search can find `x`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 2`, `3 2 1`
  - Output: `1`, `1 3`
  - Reason: Swapping `p[1]` and `p[3]` (1-based indexing) makes the permutation partially sorted enough for the binary search to find `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search can find the target element `x` in the permutation. The logic for determining the swaps and the binary search itself are implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
