The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` must be between 1 and 2·10^4, as specified in the initial state. The other information in the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference for the left side and '1' indicates a preference for the right side. The total number of test cases `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
