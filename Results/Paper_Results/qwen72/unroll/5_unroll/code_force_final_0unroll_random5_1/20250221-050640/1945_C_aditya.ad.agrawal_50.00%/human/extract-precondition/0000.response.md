Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference for the left side and '1' indicates a preference for the right side. The function should be designed to handle these inputs and produce the correct output for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
