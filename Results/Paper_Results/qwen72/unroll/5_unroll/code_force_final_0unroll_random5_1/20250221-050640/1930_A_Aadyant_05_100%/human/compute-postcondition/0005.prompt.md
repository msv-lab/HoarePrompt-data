Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `final` list will contain `t` integers, each representing the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list of 2n integers for each test case. The variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be in their final states after the last iteration of the loop, with `num` being equal to `int(n) - 1`, `s` being the sum of the elements at even indices of the last test case, `list2` being the sorted list of the last test case, and `list1` being the list of strings from the last input split.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
