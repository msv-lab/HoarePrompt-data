Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing 2n integers.
