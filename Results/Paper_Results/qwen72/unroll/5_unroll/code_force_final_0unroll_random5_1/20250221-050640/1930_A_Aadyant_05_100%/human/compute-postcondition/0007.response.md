The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a_list`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. `a_list` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `a_list`. The exact return value for each test case is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each inner list of 2n integers and produces a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a_list` where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases in `a_list`.**
