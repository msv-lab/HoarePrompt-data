Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, otherwise it has printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not retained after the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.**
