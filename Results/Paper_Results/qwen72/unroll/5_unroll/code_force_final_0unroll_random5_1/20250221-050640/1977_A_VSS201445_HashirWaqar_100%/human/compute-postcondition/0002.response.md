The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the function signature should include these parameters, the function would look like this:
```
def func(t, n, m):
```
Given this, the function accepts three parameters:
- `t`: The number of test cases, a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n`: A non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `m`: A non-negative integer such that 1 <= m <= 100.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `n` and `m` are within the valid range (1 <= n, m <= 100), the function returns a result for each test case.
- Case_2: If `n` or `m` are out of the valid range, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n`, and `m` (both non-negative integers within the range 1 to 100). For each test case, if `n` and `m` are within the valid range, it returns a result. If `n` or `m` are out of the valid range, it returns an error message indicating invalid input.**
