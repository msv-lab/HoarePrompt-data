Output State: **`n` remains the same, `arr` remains the same, `prefix` is now a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index, starting with 0, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0].** 

The variable `pre` is initialized as a list of 32 sublists, each containing the values [0, 0]. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, and `prefix` still holds the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index, starting with 0.
