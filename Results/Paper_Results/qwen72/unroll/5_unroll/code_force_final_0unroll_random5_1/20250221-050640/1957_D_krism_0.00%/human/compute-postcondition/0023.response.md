Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` where each element at index `i` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0. The function also maintains two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) in the prefix XOR values. After processing, the function calculates a final integer `ans` based on these counts and prints `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, `prefix` contains the cumulative XOR values, `pre` contains the updated counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position, and `suf` has all counts set to 0. **
