To determine what will be printed by the `print(arr, prefix)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains the same. This implies that `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `arr` remains the same. This means `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index, starting with 0.

2. **Understanding `prefix`:**
   - The first element of `prefix` is 0.
   - For each subsequent index `i` in `prefix`, the value is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to index `i`.

Let's assume `arr` is a list of integers, for example, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **Calculating `prefix`:**
   - `prefix[0] = 0`
   - `prefix[1] = 0 ^ arr[0] = 0 ^ 1 = 1`
   - `prefix[2] = prefix[1] ^ arr[1] = 1 ^ 2 = 3`
   - `prefix[3] = prefix[2] ^ arr[2] = 3 ^ 3 = 0`
   - `prefix[4] = prefix[3] ^ arr[3] = 0 ^ 4 = 4`
   - `prefix[5] = prefix[4] ^ arr[4] = 4 ^ 5 = 1`

So, for `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the `prefix` list would be `[0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(arr, prefix)` statement will print the list `arr` and the list `prefix`.

Given the initial state and the example list `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be:
Output: **[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1]**

If the exact values of `arr` are not provided, the output will be described in terms of the given information:
Output: **[arr], [0, arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]] (where `arr` is the list of integers and `prefix` is the list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index, starting with 0)**
