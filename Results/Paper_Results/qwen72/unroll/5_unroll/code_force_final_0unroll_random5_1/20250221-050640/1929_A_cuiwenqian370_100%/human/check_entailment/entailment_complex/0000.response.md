Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The elements of the array can be rearranged in any way to maximize this beauty.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, this approach does not maximize the beauty. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in a way that maximizes the positive differences and minimizes the negative differences. This is typically done by alternating the largest and smallest elements in the array.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not alternate elements, so it does not necessarily produce the maximum beauty.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The input handling and test case processing are correct and follow the problem's constraints.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, resulting in a beauty of \((4-1) + (3-2) = 3 + 1 = 4\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. It calculates the sum of absolute differences in a sorted array, which is not the optimal approach.

Correctness: **False**
