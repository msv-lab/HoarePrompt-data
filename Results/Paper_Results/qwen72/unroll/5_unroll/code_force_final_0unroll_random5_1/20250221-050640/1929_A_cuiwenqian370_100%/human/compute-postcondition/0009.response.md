The function `func_2` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function reads or processes input in a specific format: a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

The function processes these test cases and returns the results for each test case. The exact nature of the processing and the results are not specified in the constraints, but it is clear that the function must handle the input in the described format and produce some output based on the test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where the first element is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, and each test case is an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns the results of processing these test cases.**
