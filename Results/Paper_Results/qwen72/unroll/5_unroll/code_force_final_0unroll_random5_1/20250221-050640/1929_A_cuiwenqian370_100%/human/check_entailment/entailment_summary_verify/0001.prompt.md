You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes a list of test cases, and prints the results of each test case to the console. The input is a list of strings where the first element is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function applies `func_1` to each test case array and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `results` to the console. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged after the function concludes, and the `results` list is the final state of the function, containing the processed results.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to maximize this beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem requires the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value, which means we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

3. **Optimal Approach:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest elements at the beginning and the largest elements at the end.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

4. **Function 1 Correction:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` should not use `abs` when calculating the beauty.
   - The correct calculation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(array):
         array.sort()
         beauty = 0
         for i in range(1, len(array)):
             beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
         return beauty
     ```

5. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(array)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result.

6. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2()` is correct. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the length \(n\) and the array elements.

7. **Output:**
   - The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
- The current implementation of `func_1(array)` is incorrect because it uses `abs` in the beauty calculation, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).
- The input handling and test case processing in `func_2()` are correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
