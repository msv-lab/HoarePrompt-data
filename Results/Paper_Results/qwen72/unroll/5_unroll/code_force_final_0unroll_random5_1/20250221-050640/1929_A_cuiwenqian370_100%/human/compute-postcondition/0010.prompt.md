You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and data is a list of strings where the first element is t, followed by the input for t test cases. Each test case input consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t`, followed by the input for `t` test cases. Each test case input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The `data` list is updated to contain the split input values. `index` is 1 + t * (1 + n), where `n` is the number of integers in each test case. `results` is a list of length `t` containing the results of `func_1` applied to each test case array.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list remains unchanged, and all elements in `results` have been printed to the console. The variables `t`, `data`, and `index` remain the same as in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a list of test cases, where the first element is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, and each test case is an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns the results of processing these test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
