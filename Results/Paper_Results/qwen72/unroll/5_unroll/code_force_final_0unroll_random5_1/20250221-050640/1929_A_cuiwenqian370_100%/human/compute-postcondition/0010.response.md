Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes a list of test cases, and prints the results of each test case to the console. The input is a list of strings where the first element is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function applies `func_1` to each test case array and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `results` to the console. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged after the function concludes, and the `results` list is the final state of the function, containing the processed results. **
