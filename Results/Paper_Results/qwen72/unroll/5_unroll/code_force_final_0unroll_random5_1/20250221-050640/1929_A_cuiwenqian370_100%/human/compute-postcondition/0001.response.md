Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t`, followed by the input for `t` test cases. Each test case input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The `input` variable is now a reference to the `read` method of the `sys.stdin` object. The `data` list is updated to contain the split input values.**

Explanation:
- The `data` list is updated to contain the split input values, which means `data` now holds the individual elements from the input as strings.
- The value of `t` remains the same and is still the first element in the `data` list.
- The structure of `data` remains as described in the initial state, but now each element is a string.
- The `input` variable is still a reference to the `read` method of the `sys.stdin` object.
