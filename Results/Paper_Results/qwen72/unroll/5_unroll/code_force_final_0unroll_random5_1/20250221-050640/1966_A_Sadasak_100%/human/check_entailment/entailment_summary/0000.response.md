Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Case Check**: If `k` is greater than `n`, it prints `n` because it is impossible to perform any operation (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation).

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`, but caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is done to avoid unnecessary large values since any frequency greater than `k` can be reduced to `k` by performing the operation multiple times.

4. **Final Output**:
   - If any card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is because you can perform the operation once to exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of reducing the number of cards further by performing multiple operations.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further. Specifically, it should continue to perform operations until no more can be done, and the minimum number of cards left should be calculated based on the remaining frequencies.

Correctness: **False**
