### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because it is impossible to perform any operations when `k` is greater than the number of cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list `nums` and caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is done to ensure that the program only considers the maximum number of cards that can be used in an exchange operation.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The program checks if any number in the frequency table has a frequency of exactly `k`.
   - If such a number exists, the program prints `k - 1` because you can perform the exchange operation and be left with `k - 1` cards.
   - If no number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `n` because it assumes that no operations can be performed.

However, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. Specifically, the program should consider the following:

- **Optimal Exchanges**: The goal is to minimize the number of cards left. If a number appears `k` times, you can exchange it for `k - 1` cards. If a number appears more than `k` times, you can repeatedly exchange it until the remaining frequency is less than `k`.
- **Remaining Cards**: After performing all possible exchanges, the remaining number of cards should be the sum of the frequencies of all numbers that are less than `k`.

The current logic only checks if any number has a frequency of exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left. For example, in the test case `10 4` with all cards having the same number, the correct answer should be 2 (after two exchanges), but the program will print 3.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple exchanges can be performed to minimize the number of cards left. It only checks for a single exchange and prints `k - 1` if a number has a frequency of exactly `k`, which is not the optimal solution.
