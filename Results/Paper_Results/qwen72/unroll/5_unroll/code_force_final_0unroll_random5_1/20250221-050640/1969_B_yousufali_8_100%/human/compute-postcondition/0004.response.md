Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where `t` must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The function then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by the loop. **
