Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks (input by the user), `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The initial state remains the same for `n`, `a`, `t`, and `ans`. The variable `cnt` is now an empty dictionary.
