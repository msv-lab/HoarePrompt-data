### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because the problem statement allows `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` for all `1 \le i \le n`. However, it is important to verify if this choice works for all test cases.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates each subsequent element of `a` as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This ensures that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i` because:
     - `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`
     - `a[i] \bmod a[i - 1] = (a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]) \bmod a[i - 1] = x[i - 1]`
   - This calculation is correct and satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x` of length `n-1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `a` for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should work for all valid inputs, including the edge case where `n = 2`. In this case, `a` would be `[500, 500 + x[0]]`, which still satisfies the condition `x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a list `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. The choice of initializing `a[0]` to 500 is valid and ensures that the subsequent elements are calculated correctly.
