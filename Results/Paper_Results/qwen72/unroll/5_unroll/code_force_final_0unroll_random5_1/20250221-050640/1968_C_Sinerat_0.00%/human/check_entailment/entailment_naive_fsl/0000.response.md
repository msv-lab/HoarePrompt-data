Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values of `x` could lead to a situation where the constructed array `a` does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will construct the array `a` as follows:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502`
- `a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506`
- `a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507`

However, this does not satisfy the condition:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 502 \bmod 500 = 2 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 506 \bmod 502 = 4 \) (correct)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 507 \bmod 506 = 1 \) (correct)

But the initial value of `a[0]` is fixed to 500, which might not always be a valid starting point for all test cases. For instance, if the input is:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The program will construct:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 1 = 501`
- `a[2] = 501 + 1 = 502`

This does not satisfy the condition:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 501 \bmod 500 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 502 \bmod 501 = 1 \) (correct)

However, the problem does not specify that `a[0]` must be 500. A valid solution for this case could be:
- `a[0] = 2`
- `a[1] = 3`
- `a[2] = 4`

This would satisfy:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 3 \bmod 2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod 3 = 1 \)

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases.
