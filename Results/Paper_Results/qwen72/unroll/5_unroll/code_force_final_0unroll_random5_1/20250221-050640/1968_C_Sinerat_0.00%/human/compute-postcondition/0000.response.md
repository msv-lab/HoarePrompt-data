To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used to iterate over a range. It does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the loop.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases `t`, which must be within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4` for the function to be valid.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` should accept a list of integers `x` where `1 <= len(x) <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
- The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
- The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t` (which is the result of `int(input())`). This value must be greater than 0 and within the specified range.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
