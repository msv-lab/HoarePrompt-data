### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `x` of `n-1` integers.

2. **Array `a` Construction:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` and it ensures that the subsequent elements can be constructed to satisfy the conditions.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `1 <= i < n`), the value is set to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i - 1] = x[i - 1]` because `a[i - 1]` is a multiple of itself, and adding `x[i - 1]` ensures the remainder is exactly `x[i - 1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed array `a` for each test case, which is the required output.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, `a[0]` is 500 and `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`, which satisfies the condition `a[1] % a[0] = x[0]`.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are respected: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. The logic is sound and the constraints are respected.

### Correctness:
**True**
