### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a major issue with the program. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which is a crucial part of the problem description. Let's break down the issues and the function summary to validate this:

1. **Function Summary for `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of a player. It takes the current position `a` and a movement direction `b` and returns the new position.
   - The function correctly unpacks `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`.
   - The function returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which is correct for moving a player.

2. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team.
   - However, it does not consider the team of the player who is scoring. This means that if a red player scores in a red goal, the program will incorrectly increment the red team's score, and similarly for the blue team.

3. **Example Input:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3 5
     .. .. R0 .. ..
     RG .. .Q .. BG
     .. .. B0 .. ..
     5
     R0 D
     R0 C .Q
     R0 L
     R0 L
     R0 T
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     4 BLUE GOAL
     FINAL SCORE: 0 1
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     4 RED GOAL
     FINAL SCORE: 1 0
     ```
   - This is incorrect because the red player scored in their own goal, and the blue team should have won the point.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To fix this, the program should check the team of the player who is scoring and the team of the goal. If they are the same, the other team should get the point.
   - The correct logic would be:
     ```python
     if mo[1] == 'T':
         player_team = mo[0][0]
         if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
             if player_team == 'R':
                 pointsb += 1
                 print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
             else:
                 pointsr += 1
                 print(i, 'RED GOAL')
         if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
             if player_team == 'B':
                 pointsr += 1
                 print(i, 'RED GOAL')
             else:
                 pointsb += 1
                 print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, leading to incorrect scoring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
