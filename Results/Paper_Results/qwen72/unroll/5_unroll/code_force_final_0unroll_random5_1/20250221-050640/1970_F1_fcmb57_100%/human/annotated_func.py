#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd. The function also implicitly assumes that the input will be followed by a grid of a x b pairs of characters, and a series of actions for the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program raises a TypeError because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, no value is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function raises a `TypeError` and does not return any value.
