### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Data Structures:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field, the players, the goals, and the movements.
   - The `players` dictionary stores the positions of the players.
   - The `goals` dictionary stores the positions of the goals for each team.
   - The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions to their respective coordinate changes.

2. **Reading the Field:**
   - The program reads the field and correctly populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - It skips empty cells and the Quaffle's initial position, which is not needed for the initial setup.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (U, D, L, R), it correctly updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - For throwing actions (T), it checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if the player is at a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team.
   - However, it does not consider the team of the player when scoring. This is a critical flaw because if a player scores in their own goal, the other team should win the point.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the player's position based on the movement direction.
   - The function correctly unpacks the current position and the movement direction, and returns the new position.

6. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.
   - The provided example correctly demonstrates this issue:
     ```
     3 5
     .. .. R0 .. ..
     RG .. .Q .. BG
     .. .. B0 .. ..
     5
     R0 D
     R0 C .Q
     R0 L
     R0 L
     R0 T
     ```
     - The expected output is:
       ```
       4 BLUE GOAL
       FINAL SCORE: 0 1
       ```
     - The program will output:
       ```
       4 RED GOAL
       FINAL SCORE: 1 0
       ```
     - This is incorrect because the red player scored in their own goal, and the blue team should have won the point.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which is a critical part of the problem description.

Final: **False**
