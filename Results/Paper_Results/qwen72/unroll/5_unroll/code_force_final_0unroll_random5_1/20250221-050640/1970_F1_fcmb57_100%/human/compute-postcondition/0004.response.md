Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function raises a `TypeError` and does not return any value. **
