Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the program only checks if the player is at a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team without considering the team of the player. This can lead to incorrect scoring when a player scores in their own goal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```
The expected output is:
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
4 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0
```
This is incorrect because the red player scored in their own goal, and the blue team should have won the point.
