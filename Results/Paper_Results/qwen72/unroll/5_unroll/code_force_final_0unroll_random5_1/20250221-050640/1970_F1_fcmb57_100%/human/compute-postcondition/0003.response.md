Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the dimensions N and M of a field, with the constraints 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b being odd. The function is intended to process a grid of a x b pairs of characters and a series of actions for a game, but it raises a TypeError because it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which is not possible since `b` is an integer. Therefore, the function does not return any value.**
