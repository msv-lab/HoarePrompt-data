Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between each element and the last element in the list, which does not address the requirement of making all elements equal by pouring water from any container to any container with a higher index.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers. Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the target amount of water in each container should be the average of the total water. The key is to ensure that we can achieve this average in each container by only pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

Here is a correct approach:

1. Calculate the average amount of water each container should have.
2. Iterate through the containers and keep a running total of the water.
3. If at any point the running total is less than the average multiplied by the number of containers processed so far, it is impossible to achieve the desired distribution because water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(nums)
        target_water = total_water // n
        
        running_total = 0
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            running_total += nums[i]
            if running_total < (i + 1) * target_water:
                possible = False
                break
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly checks if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by only pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.
