### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers, each with a certain amount of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from any container to any container with a higher index. This means we can only move water to the right, not to the left.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm should check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only pouring water to the right.
   - If the last container (index `n-1`) already has the target amount of water, then it is impossible to pour water into it from any other container, and we need to check if the remaining containers can be balanced.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - The program then calculates the difference between each container's water and the last container's water.
   - It sums these differences and checks if the sum is zero.
   - If the sum is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the last container's water amount is the target amount for all containers.
   - The correct target amount should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the last container's water amount is not the target amount.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the target amount of water for each container and does not properly check if it is possible to balance the containers by pouring water to the right.

### Correctness:
**False**
