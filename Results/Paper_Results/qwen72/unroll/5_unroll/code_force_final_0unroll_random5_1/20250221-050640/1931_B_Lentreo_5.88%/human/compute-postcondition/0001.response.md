The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted since it is not used in the loop body. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and `_` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
