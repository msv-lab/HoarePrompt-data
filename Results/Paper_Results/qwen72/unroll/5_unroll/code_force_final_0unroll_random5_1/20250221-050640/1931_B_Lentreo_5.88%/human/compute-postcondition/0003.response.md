The function `func` is described with certain parameters and constraints but the function signature provided does not include these parameters. Assuming the function should accept these parameters, the correct function signature would be:
```
def func(t, n, a):
```

Given the parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. However, based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes the list `a` in some way related to the sum of its elements and the number of elements `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`; and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of the list `a` and the constraints provided, but the specific output is not defined in the given information.**
