### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `b`.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The function iterates through the list `b` from index `0` to `n-3` (i.e., `a-2`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)
   - The goal of these operations is to reduce the elements of the array such that the elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` are adjusted based on the value at index `i`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the last two elements of the list `b` are zero.
   - If both `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are zero, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Variable Name:**
  - The variable `a` is used to store the number of elements in the array, but it should be `n` to match the problem description.
  - This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.

- **Logic Flaw:**
  - The logic for checking if the array can be made zero is flawed. The operations are applied in a way that does not account for the possibility of negative values being introduced in `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` during the loop.
  - Specifically, the operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` can make `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` negative, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.
  - The final check only looks at the last two elements, but it should ensure that all elements are zero after the operations.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not properly handle the possibility of negative values being introduced during the operations, and it does not check all elements of the array to ensure they are zero.

### Correctness: **False**
