### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It initializes `index` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from `data[index]`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the encoded string `b` from `data[index]`.
   - It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.
   - This part of the program is correctly implemented and handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
     - It constructs `unique_chars` by converting `b` to a set (to get distinct characters) and then sorting the set.
     - This step correctly creates the auxiliary string `r` as described in the problem.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - The function creates a dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping of each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
     - The loop `for i in range(len_unique):` iterates over the sorted unique characters and maps each character to its symmetric character in the list.
     - For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Decoding the String:**
     - The function constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.
     - This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method: `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)`.
     - The function then returns the decoded string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Character String:**
     - If the encoded string `b` is a single character, `unique_chars` will also be a single character.
     - The mapping will be `{'a': 'a'}` (or any other single character).
     - The decoded string will be the same as the encoded string, which is correct.
   - **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
     - The program correctly handles strings with repeated characters by mapping each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters.
     - For example, if `b` is `"ttf"`, `unique_chars` will be `['f', 't']`, and `char_map` will be `{'f': 't', 't': 'f'}`.
     - The decoded string will be `"fft"`, which is correct.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the algorithm described in the problem statement.
   - It correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` and the symmetric character mapping.
   - It correctly decodes the string by replacing each character with its symmetric character.
   - The program handles all edge cases and test cases as specified in the problem description.
