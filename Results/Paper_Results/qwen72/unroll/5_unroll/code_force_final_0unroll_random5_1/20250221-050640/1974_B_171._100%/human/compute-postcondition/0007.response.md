Output State: **The program returns the string `decoded`, which is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its reverse in the list. The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.**
