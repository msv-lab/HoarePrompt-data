### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b` from the subsequent elements of `data`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `encoded` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map` and returns the decoded string.

3. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the encoded string.
   - **Symmetric Mapping:**
     - The mapping is created such that the first character in the sorted list maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on. This is consistent with the problem description.
   - **Decoding:**
     - The program correctly decodes the string by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart using the `char_map` dictionary.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - **Single Character Strings:**
       - If the encoded string has only one unique character, the `char_map` will map that character to itself, which is correct.
     - **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
       - The program handles repeated characters correctly by mapping each occurrence to its symmetric counterpart.
     - **Empty Input:**
       - The problem guarantees that the input will have at least one test case and each test case will have a valid string, so the program does not need to handle empty input.

4. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and processing each one individually.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description and handles all edge cases as expected.

### Final:
**True**
