Output State: **`decoded` is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse in the list. `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by joining the characters from `encoded` after replacing each character with its corresponding value in `char_map`. The dictionary `char_map` maps each character in `unique_chars` to its reverse in the list. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` are not modified by this code.
