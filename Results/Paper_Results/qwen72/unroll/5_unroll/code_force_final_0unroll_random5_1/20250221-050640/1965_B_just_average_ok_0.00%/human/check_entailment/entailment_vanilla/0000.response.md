### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` containing the first 24 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^23]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because it can represent any number in the range `[1, 2^24 - 1]` using subsets (binary representation).

3. **Modifying the Sequence:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (which is a non-negative integer because `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
     - `k + 1` (to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence).
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence and to help form other sums).
   - It removes `nums[idx]` from the sequence to prevent forming `k`.

4. **Ensuring No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
   - By removing `nums[idx]` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
   - The removed element `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 that is part of the binary representation of `k`. Removing it breaks the possibility of forming `k` using the remaining elements.

5. **Ensuring All Other Sums in `[1, n]` Can Be Formed:**
   - The remaining elements in `nums` can still form any sum in the range `[1, n]` except `k`.
   - The added elements `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming sums that are greater than `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums` and the sequence itself.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements.
- It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing a key element and adding new elements.
- It also ensures that all other sums in the range `[1, n]` can be formed by the remaining elements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
