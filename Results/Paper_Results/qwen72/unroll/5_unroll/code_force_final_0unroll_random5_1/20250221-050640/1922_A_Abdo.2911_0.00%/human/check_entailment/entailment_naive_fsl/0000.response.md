Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to correctly handle cases where `a` and `b` differ at a position, and `c` matches one of them at that position. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
abc
abd
abe
```

In this case, the program will generate the template `['a', 'B', 'C']`. However, the string `c` matches the template at the first position (`a` == `a`), which should not be allowed. The program incorrectly prints `YES` for this case, while the correct output should be `NO`.
