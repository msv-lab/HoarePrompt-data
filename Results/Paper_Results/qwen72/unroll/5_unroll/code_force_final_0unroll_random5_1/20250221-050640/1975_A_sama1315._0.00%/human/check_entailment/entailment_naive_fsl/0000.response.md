Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array can be split into two parts, swapped, and then become sorted. For example, consider the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`. According to the problem description, this array can be sorted by performing the operations described. However, `func_1` will return "No" because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if there exists a split point where the array can be divided into two parts, and after swapping these parts, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The current implementation does not do this, making it incorrect.
