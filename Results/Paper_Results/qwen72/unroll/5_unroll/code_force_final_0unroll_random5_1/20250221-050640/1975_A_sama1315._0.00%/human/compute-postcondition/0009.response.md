The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input, expecting a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the input array.

Functionality: **The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It processes each test case and returns the result based on the input array.**
