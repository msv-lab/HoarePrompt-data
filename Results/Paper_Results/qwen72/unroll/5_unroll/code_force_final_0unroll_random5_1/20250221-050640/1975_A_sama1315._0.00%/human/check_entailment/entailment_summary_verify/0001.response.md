### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The array can be split at any index, and the two resulting parts can be swapped any number of times.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if any element is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order. It only checks the current order of the array.

3. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly splits the input data and converts it to the appropriate format.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function `func_2` is correctly implemented to handle the input and output format, but it relies on `func_1` which is flawed.

4. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The main issue is with `func_1(arr)`. It only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be split into `x = arr[:i]` and `y = arr[i:]`.
   - After swapping, the array should be `y + x`.
   - The array `y + x` should be non-decreasing.
   - Additionally, the last element of `y` should be less than or equal to the first element of `x` to ensure the array remains non-decreasing after the swap.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to modify `func_1(arr)` to check for the possibility of sorting by splitting and swapping.
   - The correct function should:
     - Identify the first point where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
     - Check if the array can be split at this point and if the resulting arrays, when swapped, form a non-decreasing array.

### Correct Function 1:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the first point where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be sorted by splitting at this point
            x = arr[:i + 1]
            y = arr[i + 1:]
            if all(y[j] <= y[j + 1] for j in range(len(y) - 1)) and all(x[j] <= x[j + 1] for j in range(len(x) - 1)) and y[-1] <= x[0]:
                return 'Yes'
            break  # No need to check further if the first split point is found
    
    # Check if the array can be sorted by splitting at the last point
    x = arr[:-1]
    y = arr[-1:]
    if all(x[j] <= x[j + 1] for j in range(len(x) - 1)) and y[0] >= x[-1]:
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because `func_1(arr)` does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
