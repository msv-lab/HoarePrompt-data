To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `index` is defined as `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where:
  - `n` is the length of the array for each test case.
  - `t` is some value that remains the same as in the initial state.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array in the test cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: 
   - `results` is a list where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to an array in the test cases.
   - The exact values in `results` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the arrays in the test cases.

2. **`print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each result from `func_1` will be printed on a new line.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the arrays and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the given information:

- The `print` statement will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.
- Each element in `results` is the result of applying `func_1` to an array in the test cases.

Output: **Each result of `func_1` applied to the arrays in the test cases, printed on a new line.**
