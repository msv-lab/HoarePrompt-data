### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The array can be split at any index, and the two resulting parts can be swapped any number of times.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if any element is greater than the next element.
   - **Key Issue:** This function does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

3. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly splits the input data and converts it to the appropriate format.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness:** Function 2 is correctly implemented for reading and processing the input, but it relies on `func_1(arr)` which is incorrect.

4. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The main issue is with `func_1(arr)`. It only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point `i` such that the array can be split into `x = arr[:i]` and `y = arr[i:]`.
   - After swapping, the array should be `y + x`.
   - The array `y + x` should be non-decreasing.
   - Additionally, the last element of `y` should be less than or equal to the first element of `x` to ensure the array remains non-decreasing after the swap.

5. **Proposed Correct Function:**
   - We need to modify `func_1(arr)` to check for the possibility of sorting by splitting and swapping.
   - The correct approach would involve finding a split point `i` such that the array can be split into `x` and `y`, and then checking if `y + x` is non-decreasing.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1(arr)` does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
