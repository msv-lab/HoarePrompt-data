The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided context, it is expected to process input in a specific format that includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function is expected to return a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
