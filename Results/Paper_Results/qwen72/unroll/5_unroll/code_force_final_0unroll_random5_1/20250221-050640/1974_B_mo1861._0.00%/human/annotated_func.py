    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character of the alphabet ('z') and moving backwards. The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the first character in this sorted order is mapped to the last available letter in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on, until all unique characters are mapped.

    #The program returns the string `s` which contains the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. In `s`, each character from `b` is replaced with a corresponding character from the end of the alphabet, maintaining the original order of characters in `b`. The mapping is based on the sorted unique characters in `b`, with the smallest character in `b` being mapped to the last letter of the alphabet ('z'), the second smallest to the second last ('y'), and so on. The length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.
