Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Character Mapping**:
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
   - It first finds the set of distinct characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted set. For example, if the sorted set of distinct characters is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, then `'a'` maps to `'d'`, `'b'` maps to `'c'`, and so on.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `s` to store the decoded result.
   - It iterates over each character in the encoded string `b` and appends the corresponding character from `char_map` to `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the decoded string `s` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.
   - The program should also handle the maximum length of the string as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly follows the decoding process described in the problem. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of `b` and then performs the symmetric replacement.

However, there is a small issue in the character mapping logic:
- The line `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It should map the character to its symmetric character in the sorted set of distinct characters, not based on the length of the entire string `b`.

The correct line should be:
```python
char_map[c] = sorted_chars[-i - 1]
```
where `sorted_chars` is the sorted list of distinct characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    sorted_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {c: sorted_chars[-i - 1] for i, c in enumerate(sorted_chars)}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

Given this correction, the program should now correctly decode the string.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect character mapping logic)  
Correctness: **True** (after the correction)
