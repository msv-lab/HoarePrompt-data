You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character of the alphabet ('z') and moving backwards. The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the first character in this sorted order is mapped to the last available letter in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on, until all unique characters are mapped. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` itself is not modified.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string containing the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` which contains the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character from `char_map`, maintaining the original order of characters in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` which contains the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
