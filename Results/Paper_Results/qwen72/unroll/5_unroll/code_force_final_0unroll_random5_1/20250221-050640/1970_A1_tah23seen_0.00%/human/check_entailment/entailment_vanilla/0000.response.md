### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.
   - This matches the problem's requirement of reading a balanced parentheses sequence and printing its balanced shuffle.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the sequence at each position.
   - It starts with `d[0] = 0`, which is the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance:
     - If the character is '(', it increments the balance.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance.
   - This correctly calculates the balance of the sequence at each position.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - After calculating the balances, the program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`.
   - This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the shuffle operation.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the balance values (`x[1]`), and in case of ties, by the positions in decreasing order.
   - This is achieved using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - This correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Issues:
- **Sorting Key**:
  - The sorting key used in the program is `key=lambda x: x[1]`, which only sorts by the balance value.
  - To correctly break ties in decreasing order of position, the key should be `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Sorting Key**: The key `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])` ensures that the dictionary is sorted by balance values in increasing order, and in case of ties, by positions in decreasing order.
- **Index Adjustment**: When appending characters to `ans`, we use `s[i - 1]` instead of `s[i]` because the positions in the dictionary are 1-based, while string indexing in Python is 0-based.

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the tie-breaking in the sorting step, which is essential for the balanced shuffle operation. The corrected program, however, is correct.
