Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). The variable `t` is now an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).**
