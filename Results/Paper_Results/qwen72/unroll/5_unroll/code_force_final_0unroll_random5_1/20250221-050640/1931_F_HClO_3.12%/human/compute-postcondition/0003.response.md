The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but processes input data that includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of chat participants and `k` represents the number of participants who posted screenshots. The function also processes `k` lines of input for each test case, each containing `n` integers `a_{ij}` (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all `a_{ij}` are different), representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`, who is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The function returns the result of processing these inputs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. It also processes `k` lines of input for each test case, each containing `n` integers representing the order of participants shown to the author of the screenshot. The function returns the result of processing these inputs for each test case.**
