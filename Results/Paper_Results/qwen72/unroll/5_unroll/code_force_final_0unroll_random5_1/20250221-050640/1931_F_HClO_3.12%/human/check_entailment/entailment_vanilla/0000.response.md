Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - It handles the case where `m == 1` by directly printing "yes" and continuing to the next test case, as a single screenshot is always consistent with itself.

2. **Initial Comparisons**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the user IDs `a1` and `a2` and the lists of other participants `l1` and `l2`.
   - It creates two filtered lists `l11` and `l22` by removing `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists of other participants are not the same after removing the user IDs, the screenshots cannot be consistent with each other.

3. **Finding the Insertion Point**:
   - The program initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first position where they differ.
   - If the differing elements are `a2` and `a1` respectively, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the current index and breaks the loop.
   - If only one of the differing elements is found, it sets the corresponding index and increments the position pointer (`p1` or `p2`).
   - If both indices are found, it breaks the loop.

4. **Constructing the Consistent List**:
   - If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, it inserts `a2` into `l2` at position `idx1` and uses `l2` as the consistent list.
   - If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, it inserts `a1` into `l1` at position `idx2` and uses `l1` as the consistent list.
   - If `idx1` equals `idx2`, it reads the third screenshot and uses the position of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` to decide which list to use.

5. **Verifying Remaining Screenshots**:
   - The program reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in a list `val`.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the list of other participants (after removing the user ID) matches the consistent list.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes".

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m == 2` by directly comparing the two screenshots and deciding the consistent list.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n == 1` and `m == 1` by printing "yes".

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently processes the input within the given constraints, ensuring that the total number of operations does not exceed the limits.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots.

Correctness: **True**
