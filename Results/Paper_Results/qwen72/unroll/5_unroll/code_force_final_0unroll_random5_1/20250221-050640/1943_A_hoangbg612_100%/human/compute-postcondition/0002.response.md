Output State: **The loop will print the value of `cur` for each test case, which represents the second smallest unique element in the sorted list `N` if there are at least two unique elements. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it will print the largest unique element in the list. The variables `S`, `N`, `M`, and `cnt` will be reset for each iteration of the loop.**
