The only objects in the loop head are the variables `char` and `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` and `letters` are empty lists, but they are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive, `char` is the first character of `password`**
