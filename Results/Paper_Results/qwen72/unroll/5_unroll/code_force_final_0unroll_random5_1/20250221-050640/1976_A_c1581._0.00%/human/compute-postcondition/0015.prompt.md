You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password in the same order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password in the same order they appear.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in `password`.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in `password`. Additionally, `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the same order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in `password`. Additionally, `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'NO' in two cases and 'YES' in one case, based on some internal logic that is not specified.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
