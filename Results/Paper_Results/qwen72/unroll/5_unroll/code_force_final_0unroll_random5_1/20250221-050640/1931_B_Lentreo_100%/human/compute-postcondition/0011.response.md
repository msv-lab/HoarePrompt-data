Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It checks whether it is possible to make all elements in the list equal to the mean of the list by only adding or subtracting the same value from each element. If at any point during the check, the cumulative deviation from the mean becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the cumulative deviation remains non-negative throughout the check, the function returns 'YES'. The function does not modify the input list `nums`. **
