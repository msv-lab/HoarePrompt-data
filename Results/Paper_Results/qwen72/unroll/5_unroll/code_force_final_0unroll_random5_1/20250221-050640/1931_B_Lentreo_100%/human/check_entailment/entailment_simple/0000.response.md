### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function Call and Initial State:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list `nums`.
   - Before the function call, the program ensures that the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have, which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.

4. **Iterating Through the Containers:**
   - The program iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to balance the water amounts using the given operation (pouring from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index). This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than can be compensated by the remaining containers.

5. **Final Check and Return:**
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program returns 'YES'.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the program returns 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and ensures that the sum of water amounts is divisible by the number of containers.
- The logic inside `func_1` is sound. It checks if it is possible to balance the water amounts by ensuring that the cumulative difference never becomes negative.
- The program correctly identifies cases where it is possible to balance the water amounts and cases where it is not.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
