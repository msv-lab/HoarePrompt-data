You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container after the operations will be the mean of the initial amounts.
   - The mean can be calculated as `mean = total // n`, where `total` is the sum of all `a_i`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - We need to check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only pouring from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - The key idea is to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the goal because we cannot pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
     - It calculates the mean amount of water.
     - It initializes a variable `curr` to track the cumulative difference.
     - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the key idea of tracking the cumulative difference.
   - The function will return 'NO' if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, which is the correct behavior.
   - The function will return 'YES' if the cumulative difference never becomes negative, which is also correct.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
