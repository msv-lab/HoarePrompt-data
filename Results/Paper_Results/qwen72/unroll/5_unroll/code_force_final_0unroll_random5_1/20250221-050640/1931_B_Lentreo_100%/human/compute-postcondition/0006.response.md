Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is equal to the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is equal to `total // n`, `curr` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `curr` to 0, while the other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding the sum of the integers in `nums` being divisible by the length of the list and the calculation of `mean` are still valid.
