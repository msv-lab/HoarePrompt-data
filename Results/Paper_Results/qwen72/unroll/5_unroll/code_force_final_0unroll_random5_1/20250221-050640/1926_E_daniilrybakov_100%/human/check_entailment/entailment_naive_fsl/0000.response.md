Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by iterating through the layers of cards (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.) and calculates the position of the k-th card laid down. The logic for determining the layer and the position within the layer is sound and handles the edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. The program correctly outputs the k-th card for the given examples and should work for other valid inputs within the specified range.
