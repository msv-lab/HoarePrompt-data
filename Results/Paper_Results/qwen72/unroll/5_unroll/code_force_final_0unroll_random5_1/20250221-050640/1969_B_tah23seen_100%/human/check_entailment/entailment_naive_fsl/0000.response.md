Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted, the cost should be 0. However, the function `func_1` always calculates a cost, even if the string is already sorted. For example, if the input string is "0000", the function will return 0, which is correct. But if the input string is "1111", the function will return 4, which is incorrect because the string is already sorted and the cost should be 0.
