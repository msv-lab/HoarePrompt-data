Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The approach taken in `func_1` is to calculate the cost based on the number of '0's that appear after '1's in the string. This is because to sort the string, any '0' that appears after a '1' must be moved to the left of the '1'. The cost for moving a '0' is calculated as the length of the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's encountered before it.

Let's break down the logic in `func_1`:
- `cost` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.
- `one` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered so far.
- The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because the substring to be shifted includes the '0' and all the '1's before it, making the length of the substring `one + 1`.

This approach is correct because:
- Each '0' that appears after a '1' must be moved to the left of all the '1's encountered before it.
- The cost for each such move is correctly calculated as the length of the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.

The program also correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
- It prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
