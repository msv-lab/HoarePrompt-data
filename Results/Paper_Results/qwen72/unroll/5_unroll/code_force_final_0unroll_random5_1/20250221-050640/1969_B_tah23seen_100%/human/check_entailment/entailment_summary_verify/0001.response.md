### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the chosen substring.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
   - The output for each test case is the minimum total cost to sort the string.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - If a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.
   - This approach is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after a '1' needs to be moved past all the '1's before it to sort the string.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the transitions from '1' to '0' and calculates the cost of moving each '0' past all the '1's before it.
   - The cost is calculated as `one + 1` because the substring includes the '0' and all preceding '1's, and the length of this substring is `one + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost will be zero, which is correct.
   - If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the cost will also be zero, which is correct.
   - For strings like "101011", the algorithm correctly identifies the transitions and calculates the cost.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For "10", the cost is 2 (one operation: "10" -> "01").
   - For "0000", the cost is 0 (no operations needed).
   - For "11000", the cost is 9 (three operations: "11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011").
   - For "101011", the cost is 5 (one operation: "101011" -> "011011" and another: "011011" -> "011101").
   - For "01101001", the cost is 11 (multiple operations to sort the string).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic and the cost calculation are correct for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
