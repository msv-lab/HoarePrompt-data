Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly, specifically mentioning that for an input string like "1111", the function returns 4, which is incorrect. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of how the function `func_1` works.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `one` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment `one` by 1.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.

3. **Return the cost**:
   - The function returns the total `cost`.

### Analysis of the Function for Sorted Strings

- **Case "0000"**:
  - The string is already sorted.
  - The function will not encounter any '0' after a '1', so `cost` remains 0.
  - The function returns 0, which is correct.

- **Case "1111"**:
  - The string is already sorted.
  - The function will encounter four '1's, incrementing `one` to 4.
  - The function will not encounter any '0' after a '1', so `cost` remains 0.
  - The function returns 0, which is correct.

### Analysis of the Function for Unsorted Strings

- **Case "10"**:
  - The string is not sorted.
  - The function will encounter one '1', incrementing `one` to 1.
  - The function will then encounter one '0' after a '1', adding `1 + 1` to `cost`.
  - The function returns 2, which is correct.

- **Case "11000"**:
  - The string is not sorted.
  - The function will encounter two '1's, incrementing `one` to 2.
  - The function will then encounter three '0's after a '1', adding `2 + 1` to `cost` for each '0'.
  - The function returns 9, which is correct.

- **Case "101011"**:
  - The string is not sorted.
  - The function will encounter one '1', incrementing `one` to 1.
  - The function will then encounter one '0' after a '1', adding `1 + 1` to `cost`.
  - The function will encounter another '1', incrementing `one` to 2.
  - The function will then encounter another '0' after a '1', adding `2 + 1` to `cost`.
  - The function will encounter two more '1's, incrementing `one` to 4.
  - The function will not encounter any more '0's after a '1'.
  - The function returns 5, which is correct.

- **Case "01101001"**:
  - The string is not sorted.
  - The function will encounter one '0', incrementing `one` to 0.
  - The function will encounter two '1's, incrementing `one` to 2.
  - The function will then encounter one '0' after a '1', adding `2 + 1` to `cost`.
  - The function will encounter another '1', incrementing `one` to 3.
  - The function will then encounter two more '0's after a '1', adding `3 + 1` to `cost` for each '0'.
  - The function will encounter another '1', incrementing `one` to 4.
  - The function will not encounter any more '0's after a '1'.
  - The function returns 11, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. It does not add any cost for '0's that appear before any '1' or for '1's that appear consecutively. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

Final: **True**
