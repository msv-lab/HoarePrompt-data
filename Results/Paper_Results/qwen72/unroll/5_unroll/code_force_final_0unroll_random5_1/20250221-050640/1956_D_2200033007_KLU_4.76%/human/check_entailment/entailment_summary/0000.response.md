Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The program does not actually process the array `a` or calculate the MEX for any subarray. Instead, it prints a hardcoded output based on the length of the array `a`. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Handling of Input**: The program reads the array `a` as a list of strings and does not convert these strings to integers. This means that the array `a` is not in the correct format for further processing.

2. **Hardcoded Output**: The function `func_1` only prints "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of the array is 2, and "13 0" otherwise. This does not solve the problem for all possible inputs. For example, for an array of length 4, the program will output "13 0" regardless of the actual values in the array, which is incorrect.

3. **Lack of Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to find the MEX of any subarray or to perform the operations described in the problem. It simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is not a valid solution.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation only prints a fixed sum and number of operations without any actual operations.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
