### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incomplete and does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and converts the string of numbers into a list of strings. However, it does not convert these strings into integers, which is necessary for performing the required operations.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a`.
   - The function only has hardcoded responses for arrays of length 2 and for all other lengths, it prints `13 0`.
   - This means that for any array length other than 2, the function will always output `13 0`, which is incorrect for most inputs.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array using the MEX operation.
   - The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform any operations to maximize the sum.
   - The program does not handle the general case of any array length between 1 and 18.

4. **Example Cases**:
   - For the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`. The program will output `13 0`, which is incorrect.
   - For the input `[0, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `4 1` with the operation `1 2`.
   - For the input `[1, 3, 9]`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is correct, but this is a coincidence and not a result of the correct logic.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases and does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for arrays of lengths other than 2.

Final: **False**
