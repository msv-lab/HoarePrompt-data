Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The program only has a hardcoded response for arrays of length 2 and 3, and it does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for other lengths of arrays. For example, for an input array of length 4, such as `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program will output `13 0`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential inputs.
