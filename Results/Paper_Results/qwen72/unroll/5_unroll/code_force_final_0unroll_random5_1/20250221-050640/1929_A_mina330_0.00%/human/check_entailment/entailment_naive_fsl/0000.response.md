Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the beauty is flawed. The program only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array, but it should consider the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be 3, as the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4] and the beauty is calculated as:
```
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
```
However, the given program will output 2, because it only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4 (but it only sums the first half, so it outputs 2)
```
This is incorrect, and thus the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
