You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: ntest is an input integer, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and kq is the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list a, repeated for the first half of the list, for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `ntest` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list, repeated for the first half of the list. This sum, `kq`, is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ntest` is the number of test cases processed, `n` is the last read number of elements, `a` is the last sorted list of integers, and `kq` is the last calculated sum of differences for the current test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the beauty is flawed. The program only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array, but it should consider the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be 3, as the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4] and the beauty is calculated as:
```
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
```
However, the given program will output 2, because it only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4 (but it only sums the first half, so it outputs 2)
```
This is incorrect, and thus the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
