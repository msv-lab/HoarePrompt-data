### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first or second row, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and reach the end).
       - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (the robot can no longer stay in the first row).
       - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and continue moving right).

   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the end of the second row).

4. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly handles the movement of the robot based on the arrows in the grid.
- It ensures that the robot can only move to the next column or down to the second row if the arrows allow it.
- The program correctly checks if the robot can reach the last cell of the second row `(2, n)`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is even, as specified in the problem constraints.
- It correctly processes the arrows and ensures that the robot does not move outside the grid.

### Issues Found:
- **Incorrect Handling of Second Row Movement**:
  - The function `func_1` has a logical issue in the second row movement. Specifically, the line `if reachable_second_row:` is not correctly implemented. The variable `reachable_second_row` is set to `False` initially and only becomes `True` if the robot can move down from the first row. However, once `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`, the function does not correctly handle the robot's movement along the second row.
  - The correct logic should be to check if the robot can move along the second row once it has moved down from the first row. The current implementation only checks the last column of the second row, which is insufficient.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot should be able to move along the second row once it has moved down from the first row. This requires a more detailed check of the second row's arrows after the robot has moved down.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the robot's movement along the second row once it has moved down from the first row.
- The program needs to be corrected to properly evaluate the robot's movement along the second row.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
                elif row2[j] == '>' and j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Final:
**False**
