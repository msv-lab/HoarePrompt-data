### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first or second row, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and reach the end).
       - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (the robot can no longer stay in the first row).
       - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and continue moving right).

   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the end of the second row).

4. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly handles the movement of the robot based on the arrows in the grid.
- It ensures that the robot can only move to the next column or down to the second row if the arrows allow it.
- The program correctly checks if the robot can reach the last cell of the second row `(2, n)`.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic that needs to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Handling of Second Row Reachability**:
  - The program sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` only when the robot is in the last column of the first row and the arrow points to the right. This is incorrect because the robot can move down to the second row from any column where the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right.
  - The program should set `reachable_second_row` to `True` whenever the robot is in a column where `row1[j] == '>'` and `row2[j] == '>'`, regardless of whether it is the last column.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot can move down to the second row from any column where `row1[j] == '>'` and `row2[j] == '>'`.
- The robot can continue moving right in the second row as long as `row2[j] == '>'`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because it does not account for the robot being able to move down to the second row from any column where both arrows point to the right.
- The program as written will fail to correctly identify some cases where the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = row2[j] == '>'
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
                elif j == n - 1:
                    break
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    
    return results
```

### Final:
**False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issue in handling the second row reachability. The corrected code should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
