Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the robot according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Movement Logic**: The robot should move left, right, up, or down first, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The current implementation does not correctly simulate this sequence of movements.

2. **State Management**: The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are not correctly managed to reflect the robot's position and the possibility of moving between rows.

3. **Termination Condition**: The program does not correctly check if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    current_row = 1
    current_col = 0

    # Simulate the robot's movement
    while current_col < n - 1:
        if current_row == 1:
            if row1[current_col] == '>':
                current_col += 1
            elif row2[current_col] == '>':
                current_row = 2
                current_col += 1
            else:
                break
        else:  # current_row == 2
            if row2[current_col] == '>':
                current_col += 1
            elif row1[current_col] == '>':
                current_row = 1
                current_col += 1
            else:
                break

    # Check if the robot has reached the end of the second row
    return current_row == 2 and current_col == n - 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        result = can_reach_end(n, row1, row2)
        print('YES' if result else 'NO')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The robot starts at position (1, 0) (i.e., the first row, first column).
2. **Movement Simulation**: The while loop simulates the robot's movement until it either reaches the end of the grid or gets stuck.
3. **Row and Column Updates**: Depending on the current row and the direction of the arrow, the robot's position is updated accordingly.
4. **Termination Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the robot is in the last column of the second row, which is the target cell (2, n).

This corrected version should accurately determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.
