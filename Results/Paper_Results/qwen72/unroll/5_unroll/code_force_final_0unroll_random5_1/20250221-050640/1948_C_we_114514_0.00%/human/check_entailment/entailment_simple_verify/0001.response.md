### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and each test case's `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in the list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and reach the end).
       - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (the robot can no longer stay in the first row).
       - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and continue moving right).

   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the end of the second row).

4. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly handles the movement of the robot based on the arrows in the grid.
- It ensures that the robot can only move to the next column or down to the second row if the arrows allow it.
- The program correctly checks if the robot can reach the last cell of the second row `(2, n)`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is even, as specified in the problem constraints.
- It correctly processes the arrows and ensures that the robot does not move outside the grid.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Issue**: The logic for setting `reachable_second_row` in the first row check is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` is redundant and incorrect because it does not account for the robot's movement after reaching the last column of the first row.
- **Correction**: The condition should be removed, and the logic should focus on whether the robot can move down to the second row and continue moving right.

- **Issue**: The logic for setting `reachable_second_row` in the second row check is also incorrect. The condition `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` is redundant and does not correctly handle the robot's movement.
- **Correction**: The condition should be removed, and the logic should focus on whether the robot can continue moving right in the second row.

### Corrected Code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the logic for setting `reachable_second_row` was flawed.
- The corrected code ensures that the robot's movement is correctly tracked and that it can only move to the next column or down to the second row if the arrows allow it.
- The corrected code correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

Final: **False**
