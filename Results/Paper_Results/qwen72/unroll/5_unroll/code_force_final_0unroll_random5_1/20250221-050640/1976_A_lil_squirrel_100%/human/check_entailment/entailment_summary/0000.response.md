Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified for a strong password. Here's a breakdown of how it meets each condition:

1. **Password Composition**: The program assumes that the input password already consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, as the problem description states that Monocarp has already implemented this condition.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program checks if any letter is followed by a digit. This is done by iterating through the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program collects all digits in the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: Similarly, the program collects all letters in the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it returns 'NO'.

If all these conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'. The program also correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and meets all the conditions for a strong password.

Correctness: **True**
