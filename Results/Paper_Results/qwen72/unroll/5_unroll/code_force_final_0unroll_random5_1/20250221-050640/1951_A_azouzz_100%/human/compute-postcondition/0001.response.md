The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used within the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
