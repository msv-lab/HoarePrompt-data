The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing two sublists, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a new list where the entire `arr` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the elements of the sublists are not altered, but the order of the sublists is reversed. The sublist that was originally second (b) now comes first, followed by the sublist that was originally first (a). Both sublists remain sorted in their non-decreasing order.
