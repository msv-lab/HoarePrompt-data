### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed. It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b` until both indices `i` and `j` are less than `n`.

4. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`. If this condition is true, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.

5. **Replacement and Counting**: When a problem is too difficult:
   - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
   - It then inserts the expected difficulty `b[j]` at the current position `i` and shifts the remaining elements to the right.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented to reflect the new problem proposed.
   - The index `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.

6. **Validating the Loop**: If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is not less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`, the program simply increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next pair of difficulties.

7. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed to make `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

8. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness of the Main Logic**: The main logic of the program is to ensure that for each `i`, `a[i] <= b[i]` by proposing new problems and replacing the most difficult one. This is done by checking if `b[j] < a[i]` and performing the necessary operations to correct the array `a`.

- **Efficiency**: The program is not the most efficient, as it repeatedly sorts the array `a` by inserting and popping elements. However, for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), this approach is acceptable and will not cause performance issues.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the arrays `a` and `b` are already in the correct order or when all elements in `a` are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as described. It ensures that the number of new problems proposed is minimized and that the final array `a` satisfies the condition `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

### Correctness:
**True**
