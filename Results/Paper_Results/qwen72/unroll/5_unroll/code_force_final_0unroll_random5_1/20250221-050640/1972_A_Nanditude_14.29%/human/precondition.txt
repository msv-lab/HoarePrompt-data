The function `priorityQueue` does not match the problem description provided. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `b` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and 1 <= len(a) == len(b) <= 100, with 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= b[i] <= 10^9 for all valid i.
