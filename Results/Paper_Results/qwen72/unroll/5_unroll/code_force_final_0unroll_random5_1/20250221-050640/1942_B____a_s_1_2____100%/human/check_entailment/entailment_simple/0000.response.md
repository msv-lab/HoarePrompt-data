Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly constructs a permutation `p` from the array `a` such that for each `i`, the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - It initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of an array of length `n` (since the MEX of a permutation of `0` to `n-1` is always `n` initially).

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The key part to verify is whether the constructed `p` satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` is calculated correctly by the program because it starts from `n` and updates to the smallest value in `p` as it progresses backward.
   - The program ensures that `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`, which is the correct value to satisfy the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as the MEX of a single-element permutation is always `1` if the element is `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX can be updated to smaller values as the loop progresses.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a` in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
