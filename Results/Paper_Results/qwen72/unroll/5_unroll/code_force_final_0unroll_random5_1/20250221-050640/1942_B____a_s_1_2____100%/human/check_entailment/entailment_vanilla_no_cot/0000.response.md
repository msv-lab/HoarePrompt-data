Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. The program follows the logic of constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` by working backwards from the last element to the first. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - `a` is read as a list of integers.

2. **Constructing the Permutation `p`**:
   - `p` is initialized as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation `p` (since the permutation contains integers from `0` to `n-1`).

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing `p` for each test case, the program prints the elements of `p`.

The logic of the program ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied for each element of `a`:
- `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- By setting `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program ensures that `p[i]` is the correct value to satisfy the MEX condition for the current prefix of `p`.

Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given data, the program will always produce a valid output. The backward construction method is a valid approach to solve this problem, and the program correctly implements this method.
