Reasoning:  
The program aims to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given relationship: \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The key to solving this problem is understanding how to compute the MEX and use it to derive the permutation `p`.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` as a list of -1s, which will be filled with the correct values.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for MEX in the permutation.
3. **Backward Loop**: The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first. This is a crucial step because the MEX of the entire permutation is known to be `n` (since all integers from 0 to n-1 are used), and as we move backward, the MEX of the prefix of `p` can only decrease or stay the same.
4. **Permutation Update**: For each index `i`, the program sets \( p_i = \texttt{mex} - a_i \). This step is based on the given relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Rearranging this, we get \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \). Since `mex` is the current MEX of the prefix, this calculation is correct.
5. **MEX Update**: The MEX is then updated to the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly computed `p[i]`. This ensures that the MEX is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to the current index.
6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program follows the correct logic and handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. The backward loop ensures that the MEX is correctly updated, and the permutation `p` is constructed such that the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds for all `i`.

Given the execution summary, the program reads the input correctly, processes it as described, and prints the results. The variables `t` and `n` are used appropriately, and the list `a` is read and processed without modification.

Correctness: **True**
