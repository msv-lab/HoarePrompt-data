Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the position (1-indexed) where the string can be split such that the left part has at least half of its length as '0's and the right part has at least half of its length as '1's. If no such split is possible, it prints the position that minimizes the difference from the ideal split. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the final values of the variables used in the last test case. **
