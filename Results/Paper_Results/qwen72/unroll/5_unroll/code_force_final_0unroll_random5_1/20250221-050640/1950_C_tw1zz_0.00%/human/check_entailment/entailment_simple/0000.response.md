Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Redundancy in Conditions**: The program has a separate condition for each hour from 01 to 23, which is unnecessarily verbose. This can be simplified using arithmetic operations.
2. **Handling of 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM**: The program incorrectly treats "12" as AM. According to the 12-hour clock, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 PM", and "00:00" should be "12:00 AM".
3. **Variable `m1` is Unused**: The variable `m1` is initialized but never used in the program. The minutes `m` are directly used in the output.
4. **Inefficient Code Structure**: The program can be made more efficient by using a single condition to handle the conversion of hours and determining AM/PM.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
        
        h = int(h)
        
        if h >= 12:
            time = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h1 = str(h - 12).zfill(2)
            else:
                h1 = '12'
        else:
            time = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h1 = '12'
            else:
                h1 = str(h).zfill(2)
        
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Hour Conversion**: The hour `h` is converted to an integer to facilitate arithmetic operations.
- **AM/PM Determination**: If `h` is 12 or greater, it is PM. If `h` is 0, it is 12 AM. Otherwise, it is AM.
- **Hour Adjustment**: For PM, if `h` is greater than 12, subtract 12 to get the 12-hour format. For AM, if `h` is 0, set it to 12. Otherwise, keep the hour as is.
- **Leading Zeros**: Use `str(h).zfill(2)` to ensure the hour is always two digits.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
