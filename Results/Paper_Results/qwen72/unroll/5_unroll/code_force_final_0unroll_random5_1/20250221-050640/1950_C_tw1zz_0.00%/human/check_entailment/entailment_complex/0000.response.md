Reasoning:

The program is designed to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The function `func` reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it splits the input string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the corresponding 12-hour format and AM/PM notation.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundant `if-elif` Statements**: The program has separate `if-elif` branches for each hour from 01 to 12 and from 13 to 23. This is not efficient and can be simplified using arithmetic operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight (00:00)**: The program incorrectly converts `00:00` to `12:00 PM`. According to the 12-hour clock, `00:00` should be `12:00 AM`.

3. **Unnecessary Variables**: The variable `m1` is initialized but never used. It can be removed to clean up the code.

Here is a more efficient and correct version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h = int(h)
        
        if h >= 12:
            time = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h1 = str(h - 12).zfill(2)
            else:
                h1 = '12'
        else:
            time = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h1 = '12'
            else:
                h1 = str(h).zfill(2)
        
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Redundant `if-elif` Statements**:
   - The original program uses a large number of `if-elif` statements to handle each hour individually. This can be simplified by converting the hour to an integer and using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format and AM/PM notation.
   - For example, if the hour is 13 or more, it should be converted to PM and the hour should be reduced by 12. If the hour is 0, it should be converted to 12 AM. For all other hours, the hour should remain the same for AM.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight (00:00)**:
   - The original program converts `00:00` to `12:00 PM`, which is incorrect. Midnight in 12-hour format is `12:00 AM`.

3. **Unnecessary Variables**:
   - The variable `m1` is initialized but never used. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
