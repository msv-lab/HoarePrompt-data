Precondition: **The function should take a string s as input, where s is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) with hh ranging from 00 to 23 and mm ranging from 00 to 59. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).**

However, the provided function definition is missing the input parameters. It should be:
```python
def func(t, times):
```
This way, the function can accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of times `times` in 24-hour format.
