You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: Output State: The function will take the input string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and convert it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each test case, it will print the converted time. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, and the final state of these variables will depend on the last input time processed. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After the loop finishes, the state of `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will reflect the last time conversion performed. The initial state of `s` and `t` will remain unchanged. 
    #
    #For example, if the input is:
    #```
    #3
    #01:15
    #13:30
    #23:45
    #```
    #The output will be:
    #```
    #01:15 AM
    #01:30 PM
    #11:45 PM
    #```
    #And the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `h1` = '11'
    #- `m1` = '45'
    #- `time` = 'PM'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is 12 correctly for PM. According to the problem description, 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly sets the time to 12:00 AM for the input "12:00". This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.
