Reasoning:  
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem specifies that the first line of input contains the number of test cases, `t`. The program should read this value and then loop `t` times to process each test case. However, the program reads `N` as the number of test cases, which is incorrect. It should be `t`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program initializes `soma` (sum) to 0 at the beginning and then accumulates the sum of the digits for all test cases in a single variable. This is incorrect because the sum should be calculated separately for each test case and printed individually.

3. **Range of Summation**: The inner loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `range(n)`), but the problem requires summing the digits from `1` to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, the range should be `range(1, n+1)`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the sum `soma` only once, after processing all test cases. Instead, it should print the sum for each test case after processing it.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())  # Read the value of n for the current test case
    soma = 0  # Initialize the sum for the current test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)  # Sum the digits of each number
    print(soma)  # Print the sum for the current test case
```

And the function `func_1` remains the same:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))  # Return the sum of the digits of n
```

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
