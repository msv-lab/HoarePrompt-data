Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `N`, and then iterates `N` times to read each test case value `n`.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: Inside the loop, for each `n`, the program iterates from `0` to `n-1` and calculates the sum of the digits of each number using the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` correctly converts the number to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these integers.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The sum of the digit sums is accumulated in the variable `soma`.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the total sum `soma`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Initialization of `soma`**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the sum from previous test cases will be carried over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

- **Range of the Inner Loop**: The inner loop should iterate from `1` to `n` (inclusive) because the problem states that the numbers from `1` to `n` are written on the board. The current loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.

- **Output for Each Test Case**: The program should print the sum for each test case individually, not the accumulated sum after all test cases.

To correct these issues, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Initialize soma for each test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the sum for the current test case
```

Given the current state of the program, it is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
