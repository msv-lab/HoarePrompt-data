Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `N` but does not process each test case individually. Instead, it accumulates the sum of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed separately.

2. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but the main loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) rather than from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) to match the problem description.

3. The program does not handle the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case efficiently. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n * t), which can be very slow for large values of `n` and `t`.

To correct the program, it should be modified to handle each test case separately and to iterate from 1 to `n` for each test case. Additionally, an optimized approach should be considered to meet the time limit requirements.
