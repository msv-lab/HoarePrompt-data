Reasoning:

The problem involves determining if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following key points:
1. **Initial Configuration**: If the entire grid is already the same color, the answer is clearly "YES".
2. **Color Transition**: If there is a way to transition all squares to a single color, it must be possible to do so by selecting appropriate subrectangles.
3. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle edge cases where the grid is small (e.g., \(1 \times 1\)) or where the grid has a specific pattern that makes it impossible to achieve a uniform color.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in the list `a`.

2. **Extracting First and Last Rows**:
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each row.
   - `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each row.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row are both uniform (i.e., all characters are the same) but different from each other.
   - If this condition is met, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the first and last rows are uniform but different.
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different from each other.
   - If this condition is met, it prints "NO" for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Uniform Rows and Columns**:
  - If the first row and the last row are both uniform but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the operation can only change the color of subrectangles, and the first and last rows would remain different.
  - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason.

- **General Case**:
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation can be used to gradually change the color of the grid, starting from any two squares of the same color and expanding the subrectangle.

### Edge Cases:
- **1x1 Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case because the grid will always be uniform.
- **Uniform Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case by printing "YES" since the grid is already the same color.
- **Non-Uniform Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case by checking the conditions and printing "YES" if the conditions are not met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
