The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `grid` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
