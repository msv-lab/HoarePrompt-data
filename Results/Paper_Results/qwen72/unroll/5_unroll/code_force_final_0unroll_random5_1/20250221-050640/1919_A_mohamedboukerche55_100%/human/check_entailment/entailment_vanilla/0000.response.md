Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description and the rules of the game.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The key insight in the problem is that the game is essentially a parity game. The player who starts with the wallet that has an odd number of coins will always win if both players play optimally.
   - This is because:
     - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, then both players will always have an even number of coins after each move.
     - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, then the player who starts with the odd number of coins will always be able to force the other player into a losing position.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the modulo operation is efficient and works for large numbers.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases in the problem description match the expected output based on the parity logic:
     - For `1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `1 4`, the sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `5 3`, the sum is 8 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `4 5`, the sum is 9 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `11 9`, the sum is 20 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `83 91`, the sum is 174 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `1032 9307`, the sum is 10339 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `839204 7281`, the sum is 846485 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `1000000000 1000000000`, the sum is 2000000000 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `53110 2024`, the sum is 55134 (even), so Bob wins.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
