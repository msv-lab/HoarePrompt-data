### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from a single line of input.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet and optionally swapping wallets.
   - The key observation is that the game will always end when the total number of coins (a + b) is odd. This is because:
     - If the total number of coins is odd, the player whose turn it is will always be able to make a move (either swap or remove a coin) until the total number of coins becomes even.
     - If the total number of coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves the total number of coins odd, and the opponent will then be able to win.
   - Therefore, the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the total number of coins is odd, and the player who starts the game will lose if the total number of coins is even.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints "Bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are both 1 (as shown in the example), and where `a` and `b` are large values (up to \(10^9\)).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient as it only performs a single modulo operation and a print statement for each test case, which is \(O(1)\) per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
