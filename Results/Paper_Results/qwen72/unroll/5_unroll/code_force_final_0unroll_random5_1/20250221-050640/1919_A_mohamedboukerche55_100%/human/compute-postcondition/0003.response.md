The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two integers `a` and `b` where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function's output is not specified, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Since the exact output is not provided, I will assume a common scenario where the function returns a result for each test case. For example, it might return the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case.
