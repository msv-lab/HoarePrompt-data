You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description and the rules of the game.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The key insight in the problem is that the game is essentially a parity game. The player who starts with the wallet that has an odd number of coins will always win if both players play optimally.
   - This is because:
     - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, then both players will always have an even number of coins after each move.
     - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, then the player who starts with the odd number of coins will always be able to force the other player into a losing position.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the modulo operation is efficient and works for large numbers.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases in the problem description match the expected output based on the parity logic:
     - For `1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `1 4`, the sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `5 3`, the sum is 8 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `4 5`, the sum is 9 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `11 9`, the sum is 20 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `83 91`, the sum is 174 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `1032 9307`, the sum is 10339 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `839204 7281`, the sum is 846485 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `1000000000 1000000000`, the sum is 2000000000 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `53110 2024`, the sum is 55134 (even), so Bob wins.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
