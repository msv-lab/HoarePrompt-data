Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `N` is an input integer. `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. `prod` is 1.**

The variable `prod` has been initialized to 1, and all other variables (`t`, `N`, `vals`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
