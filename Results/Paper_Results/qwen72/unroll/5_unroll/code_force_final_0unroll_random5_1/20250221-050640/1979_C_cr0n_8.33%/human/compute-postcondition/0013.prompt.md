You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and k is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`. The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`. `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`. The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Additionally, `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print the elements of the list `vprod` as strings, separated by spaces.
    #    - Based on the initial state, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
    #    - The exact values of `vprod` depend on the values in `vals`, but the format of the output will be the elements of `vprod` as strings, separated by spaces.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
