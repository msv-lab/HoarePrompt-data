Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. According to the problem description, if all multipliers are the same, it is impossible to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not check for this condition and will output a solution even when it should return \(-1\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
The program will output:
```
24000 24000 24000 24000 24000
```
However, the correct output should be \(-1\) because it is impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome. The total bet in this case is \(24000 \times 5 = 120000\), and the amount received back for any winning outcome is \(5 \times 24000 = 120000\), which is not strictly greater than the total bet.
