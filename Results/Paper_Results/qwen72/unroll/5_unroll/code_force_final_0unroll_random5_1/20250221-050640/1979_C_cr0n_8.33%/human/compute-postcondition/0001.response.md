Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `N` is an input integer. `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.**

Explanation:
- The code `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `vals` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
