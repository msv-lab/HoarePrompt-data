### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `ones` and `sum` Arrays:**
   - The `ones` array is used to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` array up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1 up to each index.
   - These arrays are initialized correctly with an extra element (index 0) to handle the prefix sum logic more easily.

2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query, the function checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray is a single element, and it cannot be good because there is no other element to satisfy the condition `a_i ≠ b_i`. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, the function calculates:
     - `onesInRange`: the number of 1s in the subarray.
     - `sumInRange`: the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray and 1.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition is derived from the requirement that the sum of the elements in `b` must equal the sum of the elements in `a`, and each element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `a` and greater than 0.
     - `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each 1 in `a` needs to be replaced by a number greater than 1 in `b` to ensure `a_i ≠ b_i`.
     - `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements in the subarray that are not 1s. Each of these elements can be replaced by a number that is 1 less than the original element to ensure `a_i ≠ b_i` and `b_i > 0`.
     - The total sum of the differences must be less than or equal to `sumInRange` to ensure that the sum of `b` can match the sum of `a`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element by printing 'NO'.
   - The function also correctly handles the general case where the subarray has multiple elements by using the prefix sum arrays to efficiently calculate the required values.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The use of prefix sum arrays ensures that the queries are processed efficiently, and the conditions for a good subarray are correctly checked.
