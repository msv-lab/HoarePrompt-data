Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses a sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays in `a` for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of the first `m` elements in `a`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The initial number of matches between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b` is calculated using the `sum` function, which iterates over the elements in `window_freq` and adds the minimum frequency of each element in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window to move through the array `a` from the first `m` elements to the end.
   - For each position, it updates the `window_freq` and `matches` by:
     - Decreasing the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window.
     - Removing the element from `window_freq` if its frequency becomes zero.
     - Increasing the frequency of the element that is sliding into the window.
     - Updating the `matches` count based on the new frequencies.

5. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The program increments `good_subarrays` whenever the number of matches is at least `k`.

6. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to see if the last window is good and updates `good_subarrays` accordingly.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic for counting good subarrays, making it a valid solution to the problem.
