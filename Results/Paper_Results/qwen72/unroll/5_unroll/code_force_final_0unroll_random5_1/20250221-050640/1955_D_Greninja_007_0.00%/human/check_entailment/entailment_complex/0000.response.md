### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a counter `b_freq` to store the frequency of each element in the list `b`.
   - It also initializes a counter `window_freq` to store the frequency of the first `m` elements in the list `a`.
   - The variable `matches` is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in `window_freq` and `b_freq`. This correctly counts the number of matching elements between the initial window of `a` and `b`.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the list `a` from the second element to the end.
   - For each position `i` in the range `n - m`, it checks if the current `matches` count is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `good_subarrays`.
   - It then updates the `window_freq` counter by removing the element `a[i]` from the current window and adding the element `a[i + m]` to the window.
   - The `matches` count is updated accordingly to reflect the changes in the window.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the function performs a final check to see if the last window (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) is a good subarray. If `matches` is still greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `good_subarrays`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total count of good subarrays.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Initialization:**
  - The initial `window_freq` is correctly set to the first `m` elements of `a`.
  - The initial `matches` count is correctly calculated.

- **Correct Sliding Window Logic:**
  - The sliding window logic correctly updates `window_freq` and `matches` for each new position.
  - The `matches` count is adjusted by subtracting the contribution of the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the contribution of the element that is sliding into the window.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check ensures that the last window is also considered, which is necessary because the loop only runs up to `n - m - 1`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where `n` is equal to `m` and where `k` is 1 or `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b`. The logic and state transitions are correct throughout the function.

### Correctness:
**True**
