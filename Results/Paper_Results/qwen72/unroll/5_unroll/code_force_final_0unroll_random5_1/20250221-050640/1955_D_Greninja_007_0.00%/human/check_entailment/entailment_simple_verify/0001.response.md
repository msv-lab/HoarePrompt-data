Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`. This is done using `map(int, input().split(' '))`, which is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Frequency Counters**: The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in both arrays `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements). This is a good approach because it allows efficient counting and comparison of elements. The initial frequency counter `b_freq` is created for `b`, and `window_freq` is created for the first `m` elements of `a`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**: The initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and `b` is calculated using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. This correctly counts the minimum number of common elements between the two frequency counters. The expression `sum((min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq))` ensures that only elements present in both `a` and `b` are considered, and the minimum frequency is used to count matches.

4. **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the second element to the `(n-m+1)`-th element. For each new position of the window:
   - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`). The program correctly decreases the count of `a[i]` in `window_freq` and removes it if the count reaches zero.
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`). The program correctly increases the count of `a[i + m]` in `window_freq`.
   - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly. The program correctly subtracts the match count for the element sliding out and adds the match count for the element sliding in.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program performs one last check to see if the final window is good. This is necessary because the loop only checks up to the second-to-last window. The final check ensures that the last window is also evaluated.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case. The output is correct and matches the expected format.

The logic and implementation of the program are correct and efficiently handle the problem constraints. The use of the `Counter` class and the sliding window technique ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.

Final: **True**
