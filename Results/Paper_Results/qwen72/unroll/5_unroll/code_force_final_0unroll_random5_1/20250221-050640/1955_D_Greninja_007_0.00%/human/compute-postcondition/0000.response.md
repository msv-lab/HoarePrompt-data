Output State: **a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, and 1 <= k <= m. Each element in a and b is an integer such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6, good_subarrays is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `good_subarrays`, which is now initialized to 0.
