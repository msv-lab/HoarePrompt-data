The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It calculates the number of ways to pick three sticks from each test case such that the lengths of the sticks can form a triangle, and prints these counts to the console. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies and prints a list `results` containing the counts for each test case. After the function concludes, the `results` list remains unchanged, and each element in the list has been printed to the console.
