You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1

    #State: The loop modifies the values of `l`, `r`, and `sunks` based on the operations performed within the loop. The final values of `l` and `r` will be such that the loop condition `l <= r` is no longer true, or the value of `k` has been reduced to 0, or the remaining elements in the list `a` cannot be processed further according to the given conditions. The value of `sunks` will be the total number of operations performed where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was fully or partially consumed. The list `a` will be modified, with some elements potentially reduced to 0 or removed from the range `[l, r]`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of operations performed where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was fully or partially consumed. This value is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the total number of operations where either the leftmost or rightmost element of the list `a` was fully or partially consumed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of operations performed where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was fully or partially consumed. This value is stored in the variable `sunks`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
