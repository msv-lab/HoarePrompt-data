### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` is zero, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means only one ship is left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the left ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the right ship `a[r]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the left ship, the left ship is fully sunk, and the durability of the right ship is reduced by the durability of the left ship.
     - If the right ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk.
     - The pointers `l` and `r` are adjusted accordingly, and the loop continues.
   - If the durability of the right ship `a[r]` is less than the left ship `a[l]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the right ship, the right ship is fully sunk, and the durability of the left ship is reduced by the durability of the right ship.
     - If the left ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk.
     - The pointers `l` and `r` are adjusted accordingly, and the loop continues.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is zero, meaning no attacks are made.
   - It also handles cases where only one ship is left and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk, which is stored in `sunks`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the attacks in the specified order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and correctly updates the durabilities and counts the number of ships sunk. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic where the program might not correctly handle the case when `k` is not sufficient to fully sink a ship but is enough to reduce its durability. Specifically, the conditions `if k >= a[l] * 2` and `if k >= a[r] * 2` might not always be accurate for the final attacks.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the final attacks correctly when `k` is not sufficient to fully sink a ship but is enough to reduce its durability. This can lead to incorrect counts of sunk ships in some test cases.
