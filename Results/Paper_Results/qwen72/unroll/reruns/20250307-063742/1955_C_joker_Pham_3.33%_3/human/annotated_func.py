    #State: The loop modifies the values of `l`, `r`, and `sunks` based on the operations performed within the loop. The final values of `l` and `r` will be such that the loop condition `l <= r` is no longer true, or the value of `k` has been reduced to 0, or the remaining elements in the list `a` cannot be processed further according to the given conditions. The value of `sunks` will be the total number of operations performed where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was fully or partially consumed. The list `a` will be modified, with some elements potentially reduced to 0 or removed from the range `[l, r]`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of operations performed where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was fully or partially consumed. This value is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total number of operations performed where either the leftmost (`a[l]`) or rightmost (`a[r]`) element of the list `a` was fully or partially consumed. The function modifies the list `a` and the value of `k` during its execution. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some elements reduced to 0, and the value of `k` will be reduced based on the operations performed. The function stops when `k` reaches 0, the list `a` is fully processed, or no further operations can be performed according to the given conditions.
