### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r`, meaning there are still ships to attack.
   - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left. The function checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it breaks the loop without incrementing `sunks`.

4. **Attack Logic:**
   - The function checks if the durability of the leftmost ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the durability of the rightmost ship `a[r]`.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, it calculates the number of attacks needed to reduce `a[l]` to 0 and updates `k` and `a[r]` accordingly.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, it calculates the number of attacks needed to reduce `a[r]` to 0 and updates `k` and `a[l]` accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the remaining attacks are exactly enough to sink one of the ships.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning no attacks are made.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one ship left and the remaining attacks are enough to sink it.

6. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the attacks in the correct order (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.) and updates the durabilities and the number of attacks accordingly. The function also handles edge cases and ensures that the loop terminates when there are no more ships to attack or when the number of attacks is exhausted.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling the attacks. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the case where the remaining attacks are not enough to fully sink a ship but are enough to reduce its durability. This can lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The function checks if `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` to determine if it can fully sink a ship and possibly the next ship. However, this logic is flawed because it assumes that the Kraken will always attack both the first and last ships in pairs, which is not always the case.
- The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, and the function should handle each attack separately rather than in pairs.

### Corrected Logic:
- The function should handle each attack individually, reducing the durability of the first or last ship by 1 each time.
- It should then check if the ship has sunk and update the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))

def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r and k > 0:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                k -= a[r]
            break
        if k >= a[l]:
            k -= a[l]
            l += 1
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[l] -= k
            k = 0
        if k > 0 and k >= a[r]:
            k -= a[r]
            r -= 1
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[r] -= k
            k = 0
    return sunks
```

This corrected program ensures that each attack is handled individually, and the durabilities and pointers are updated correctly.
