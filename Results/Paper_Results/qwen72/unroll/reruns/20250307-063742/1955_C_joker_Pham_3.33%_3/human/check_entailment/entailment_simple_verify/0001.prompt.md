You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
     - The second line contains `n` integers, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (durability of each ship).

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks.

3. **Attack Pattern:**
   - The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, then the first again, and so on.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.
   - The process continues until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `n`, `k`, and `a` as inputs and returns the number of ships sunk. Let's break down the logic inside `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 to count the number of ships sunk.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, there are several conditions to handle different scenarios:
     - **If `k` is 0:**
       - The loop breaks because no more attacks can be made.
     - **If `l` is equal to `r`:**
       - This means there is only one ship left.
       - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the last ship, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks.
       - Otherwise, the loop breaks because the ship cannot be sunk with the remaining attacks.
     - **If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`:**
       - The first ship is attacked first.
       - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, the first ship is sunk, and the last ship's durability is reduced by `a[l]`.
       - If the last ship's durability becomes 0, it also sinks.
       - The loop continues with the next ships.
       - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
       - Otherwise, the loop breaks because the first ship cannot be sunk with the remaining attacks.
     - **If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`:**
       - The last ship is attacked first.
       - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, the last ship is sunk, and the first ship's durability is reduced by `a[r]`.
       - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it also sinks.
       - The loop continues with the next ships.
       - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`, the last ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
       - Otherwise, the loop breaks because the last ship cannot be sunk with the remaining attacks.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Redundant `if k == 0` checks:**
   - The check `if k == 0` is repeated multiple times within the loop. This is redundant and can be simplified.
   - The loop should break as soon as `k` becomes 0.

2. **Handling of single ship:**
   - The condition `if l == r` correctly handles the case where only one ship is left.
   - However, the logic can be simplified to avoid breaking the loop prematurely.

3. **Attack Pattern:**
   - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - The logic for reducing the durability and checking if a ship sinks is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where `k` is very large and all ships are sunk.
   - The program should also handle cases where `k` is small and no ships are sunk.

### Simplified and Corrected Logic:
The program can be simplified to avoid redundant checks and ensure the loop continues until all attacks are made or all ships are sunk.

### Correctness:
The given program is correct in its logic and handles the problem as described. However, it can be optimized for clarity and efficiency.

Correctness: **True**
