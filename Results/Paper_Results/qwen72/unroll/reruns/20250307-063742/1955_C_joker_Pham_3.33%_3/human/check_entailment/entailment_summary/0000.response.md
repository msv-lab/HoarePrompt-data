### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining how many ships are sunk after the Kraken attacks them a certain number of times. The Kraken attacks the ships in an alternating pattern, starting with the first ship, then the last, and so on, until it has attacked `k` times or all ships have sunk.

Let's break down the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks because no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it will sink, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks because there are no more attacks to be made.

3. **Attacking the Ships**:
   - If `a[l]` (the durability of the leftmost ship) is less than or equal to `a[r]` (the durability of the rightmost ship):
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, the Kraken can attack the leftmost ship twice (once from the front and once from the back) and reduce the durability of the rightmost ship by `a[l]`. The leftmost ship will sink, and `l` is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the leftmost ship twice, and the remaining attack will sink the leftmost ship. The loop breaks.
     - If `k` is less than `2 * a[l] - 1`, the Kraken cannot complete the attacks, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, the Kraken can attack the rightmost ship twice (once from the back and once from the front) and reduce the durability of the leftmost ship by `a[r]`. The rightmost ship will sink, and `r` is decremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the rightmost ship twice, and the remaining attack will sink the rightmost ship. The loop breaks.
     - If `k` is less than `2 * a[r] - 1`, the Kraken cannot complete the attacks, and the loop breaks.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the total number of ships that have sunk (`sunks`).

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the alternating attacks by the Kraken.
  - It correctly reduces the durability of the ships and counts the number of ships that sink.
  - The program also correctly handles the edge case where `l` equals `r` (only one ship left).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is less than the total number of attacks needed to sink any ship.
  - It correctly handles cases where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The operations inside the loop are straightforward and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the alternating attacks, the reduction of durability, and the counting of sunk ships as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
