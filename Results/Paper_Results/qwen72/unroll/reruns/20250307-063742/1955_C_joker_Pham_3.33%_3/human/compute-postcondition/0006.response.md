Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total number of operations performed where either the leftmost (`a[l]`) or rightmost (`a[r]`) element of the list `a` was fully or partially consumed. The function modifies the list `a` and the value of `k` during its execution. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some elements reduced to 0, and the value of `k` will be reduced based on the operations performed. The function stops when `k` reaches 0, the list `a` is fully processed, or no further operations can be performed according to the given conditions. **
