The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `k` is a positive integer representing a threshold value, where 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns the total number of operations performed where either the leftmost element `a[l]` or the rightmost element `a[r]` of the list `a` was fully or partially consumed. This total number of operations is stored in the variable `sunks`.
