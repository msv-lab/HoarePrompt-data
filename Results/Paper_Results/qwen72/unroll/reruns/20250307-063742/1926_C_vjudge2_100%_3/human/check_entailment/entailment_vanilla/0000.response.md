Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced by the sum of its digits.
- The task is to find the sum of these new numbers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - It initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of the digits of \( i \) using the function `func_1(i)`.
   - It adds this sum to the running total `sum` and appends the running total to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - The function returns the sum of the digits.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Precomputation:**
  - The precomputation loop correctly calculates the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to 200,000.
  - The list `A` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each index.
  - This allows for efficient retrieval of the sum for any \( n \) within the range during the test cases.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - It uses a while loop to handle each digit, which is a standard and correct approach.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`.
  - This ensures that the answer is given in constant time \( O(1) \) for each test case, which is efficient and meets the time limit requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. It precomputes the necessary sums efficiently and retrieves the results in constant time for each test case, ensuring it can handle the maximum number of test cases within the given time limit.

Correctness: **True**
