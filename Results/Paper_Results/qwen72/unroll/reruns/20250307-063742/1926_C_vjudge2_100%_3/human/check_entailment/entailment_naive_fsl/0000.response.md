Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in a list `A`. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum for the given `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that the program can handle the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the heavy computation is done only once and the results are reused for each test case. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number, and the main loop correctly prints the sum for each test case. All edge cases, including the smallest and largest possible values of `n`, are handled correctly.
