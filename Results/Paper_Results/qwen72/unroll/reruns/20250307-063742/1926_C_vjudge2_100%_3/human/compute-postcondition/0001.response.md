The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `a`, but `a` is not used in the loop condition, so we only need to consider `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is 0. Since `num` is already within a range that ensures it is not equal to 0, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
