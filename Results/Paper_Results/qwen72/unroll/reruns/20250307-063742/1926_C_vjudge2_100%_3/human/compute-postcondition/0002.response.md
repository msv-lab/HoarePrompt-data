Output State: **`a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `num` is not 0. In each iteration, the last digit of `num` (i.e., `num % 10`) is added to `a`, and then `num` is divided by 10 (using integer division, `int(num / 10)`), effectively removing the last digit. This process repeats until `num` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates. The final value of `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the initial value of `num`.
