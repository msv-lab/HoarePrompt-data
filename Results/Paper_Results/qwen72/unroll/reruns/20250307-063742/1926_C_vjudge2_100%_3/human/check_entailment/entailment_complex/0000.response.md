Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000 (inclusive), calling `func_1` for each integer `i` to compute the sum of its digits.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the updated `sum` is appended to the list `A`.
   - This precomputation step ensures that `A[n-1]` will contain the sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly add the last digit of `num` to `a` and then remove the last digit by performing integer division by 10.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The function returns `a`, which is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.

3. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `A[n-1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Correctness of the Precomputation**:
   - The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200000.
   - This ensures that for any `n` in the range 1 to 200000, the program can quickly retrieve the correct sum from the list `A`.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(N) time, where N is 200000.
   - Each test case runs in O(1) time because it simply retrieves a precomputed value from the list `A`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200000 correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
