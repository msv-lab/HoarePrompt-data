You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Annotated Code: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. It calculates the sum of the digits of `num` and returns this sum. After the function concludes, `num` is 0 and the returned value is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced by the sum of its digits.
- The task is to find the sum of these new numbers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - It initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of the digits of \( i \) using the function `func_1(i)`.
   - It adds this sum to the running total `sum` and appends the running total to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - The function returns the sum of the digits.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Precomputation:**
  - The precomputation loop correctly calculates the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to 200,000.
  - The list `A` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each index.
  - This allows for efficient retrieval of the sum for any \( n \) within the range during the test cases.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - It uses a while loop to handle each digit, which is a standard and correct approach.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`.
  - This ensures that the answer is given in constant time \( O(1) \) for each test case, which is efficient and meets the time limit requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. It precomputes the necessary sums efficiently and retrieves the results in constant time for each test case, ensuring it can handle the maximum number of test cases within the given time limit.
