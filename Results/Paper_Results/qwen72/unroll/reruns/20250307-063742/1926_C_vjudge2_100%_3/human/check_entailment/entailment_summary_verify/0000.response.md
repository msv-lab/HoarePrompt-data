### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the sum of the digits of a given integer `num`.
   - The function iterates through each digit of `num` by repeatedly taking the modulus 10 (`num % 10`) to get the last digit and then integer dividing by 10 (`int(num / 10)`) to remove the last digit.
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0, and the sum of the digits is returned.
   - The function summary is accurate: it correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, which returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in the list `A`.
   - The list `A` is constructed such that `A[i-1]` contains the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - This precomputation ensures that for any given `n` in the range 1 to 200,000, the program can quickly retrieve the result from `A` without recomputing the sum of digit sums for each test case.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, retrieves the precomputed sum from `A` using `A[n-1]`, and prints it.
   - This approach is efficient and adheres to the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the heavy computation is done only once during the precomputation phase.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible value of `n` (1) correctly. For `n=1`, the sum of the digit sums is 1, and `A[0]` is 1.
   - The program also handles the largest possible value of `n` (200,000) correctly. The precomputation ensures that `A[199999]` contains the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case.
   - It prints the correct sum for each test case as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality and efficiently handles the constraints. The precomputation ensures that the program can quickly provide the correct sum for each test case within the time limit.

Final: **True**
