Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**: The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in the list `A`. This is efficient and allows for quick lookups during the test cases.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the value of `n` and printing the precomputed sum from the list `A`.

4. **Output**: The output for each test case is the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n`, which is correctly stored in `A[n - 1]`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, this approach is efficient and correct. The precomputation step ensures that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
