Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the sums of digits of numbers from 1 to n. It precomputes these sums up to the maximum possible value of n (200,000) and stores them in a list `A`. For each test case, it then simply retrieves the precomputed sum for the given n.

1. **Precomputation Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, 200001):` iterates from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each integer `i`, it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of its digits.
   - It adds this sum to the running total `sum`.
   - It appends the running total to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer `num`.
   - It initializes `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly add the last digit of `num` to `a` and then remove the last digit by integer division.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - Finally, it returns `a`, which is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.

3. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The loop `for t in range(int(input())):` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` using `A[n - 1]`.

The program is efficient because it precomputes the sums in O(n) time and then retrieves the results in O(1) time for each test case. The precomputation is done once and reused for all test cases, which is suitable given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

However, there is a minor issue in the comment within the `func_1` function. The comment states "The program returns 0." which is incorrect. The function `func_1` correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

Given the problem description and the execution states, the program is correct in its logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
