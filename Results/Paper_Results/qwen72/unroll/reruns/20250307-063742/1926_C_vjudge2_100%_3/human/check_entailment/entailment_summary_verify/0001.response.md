### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It iterates over each integer \( i \) from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each \( i \), it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - It adds this sum to the running total `sum` and appends the running total to the list `A`.
   - This precomputation ensures that the sum of the digit sums for any \( n \) within the range 1 to 200,000 is available in constant time \( O(1) \) during the test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`.
   - This ensures that the answer is given in constant time \( O(1) \) for each test case, which is efficient and meets the time limit requirement of 0.5 seconds per test.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and efficiently retrieves the results for each test case. It meets the problem requirements and the time limit constraints.

Final: **True**
