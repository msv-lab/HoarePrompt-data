Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correctly structured to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how each function contributes to the solution:

1. **func_1(a)**: This function calculates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. It is used to verify the correctness of the recovered array by comparing its subarray sums with the input subarray sums.

2. **func_2(cts)**: This function identifies the missing subarray sum by using a list `odds` to track unique sums. If a sum appears an odd number of times, it is added to `odds`. If it appears an even number of times, it is removed from `odds`. The remaining sum in `odds` is the missing subarray sum.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using the list of unique sums (`odds`). It works by placing the sums in the middle of the array and then filling outwards, ensuring the array remains a palindrome.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function is used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`). It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until it finds the first mismatch, which is the missing subarray sum.

The overall logic of the program is to:
- Generate all subarray sums for a potential solution.
- Identify the missing subarray sum.
- Use the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the palindrome array.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program seems to be correctly designed to handle the input and produce a valid palindrome array.
