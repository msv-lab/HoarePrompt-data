### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the list of subarray sums `subarraySums`.

2. **Sorting and Identifying Odd Elements:**
   - The `subarraySums` list is sorted, which is a necessary step to identify the missing subarray sum.
   - The `func_2` function is used to identify elements that appear an odd number of times in the sorted list. This is done by removing consecutive duplicates and keeping the elements that do not have a matching pair.

3. **Determining the Missing Sum:**
   - The program checks if the number of odd elements is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. If so, it further categorizes the odd elements into `oddvals` and `evenvals` and determines the missing sum based on the presence of both even and odd values.
   - If the number of odd elements is not greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it directly calculates the missing sum using the `func_4` function, which finds the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`.

4. **Reconstructing the Palindrome:**
   - The missing sum is appended to the list of odd elements and the list is sorted again.
   - The `func_3` function is used to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd elements. This function populates the array `a` by distributing the values in `odds` symmetrically.

5. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1` generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This function is used to generate the expected subarray sums for the reconstructed array `a`.

6. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2` identifies elements that appear an odd number of times in the list of subarray sums. This is crucial for determining the missing sum.

7. **Function 3:**
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd elements. It ensures that the array is symmetric by placing the values in the middle and then distributing the remaining values symmetrically.

8. **Function 4:**
   - `func_4` is used to find the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`. This function is used to determine the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the correct logic for reconstructing the palindrome array based on the given subarray sums. It correctly handles the identification of the missing sum and the reconstruction of the array. The functions are used appropriately, and the program should produce a valid palindrome array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
