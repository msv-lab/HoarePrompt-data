### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the sums of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindrome array `a`.
   - The goal is to recover the palindrome array `a` from these sums.
   - The input guarantees that there is at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function generates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays of a given list `a` and returns them sorted. It helps in generating the complete set of subarray sums for a given array.
   - **func_2**: This function identifies the elements in the list `cts` that appear an odd number of times. It is used to find the unique elements that are not part of a pair in the list of subarray sums.
   - **func_3**: This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the list `odds`. It places the elements in the middle of the array and ensures the array is symmetric.
   - **func_4**: This function finds the first mismatch between two lists `bigList` and `smallList` by removing matching elements from the end of both lists. It is used to identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the list of subarray sums `subarraySums`.
   - It sorts the `subarraySums` to facilitate the identification of the missing sum.
   - **Step 1**: It uses `func_2` to find the elements that appear an odd number of times in `subarraySums`.
   - **Step 2**: It determines the missing sum based on the number of odd elements:
     - If the number of odd elements is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it further categorizes them into odd and even values and determines the missing sum.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a temporary array `b` using `func_3` and calculates its subarray sums using `func_1`. It then uses `func_4` to find the missing sum.
   - **Step 3**: It appends the missing sum to the list of odd elements and reprocesses it using `func_2` to ensure it is correctly identified.
   - **Step 4**: It constructs the final palindrome array `a` using `func_3` and prints it.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of subarray sums with the sorted list of subarray sums of a temporary array.
   - The construction of the palindrome array `a` is done by ensuring that the elements are symmetrically placed.
   - The use of `func_2` and `func_3` ensures that the final array `a` is a palindrome and matches the given subarray sums.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the logic required to solve the problem. It identifies the missing subarray sum and constructs a valid palindrome array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
