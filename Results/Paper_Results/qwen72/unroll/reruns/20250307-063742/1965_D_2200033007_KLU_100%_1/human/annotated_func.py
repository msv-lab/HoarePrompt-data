    #The program returns the sorted list `cts` which contains the cumulative sums of all sublists of `a` starting from each index `i` to the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of sublists of `a`, where each sublist starts from an index `i` in `a` and extends to the end of the list. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

The elements in `odds` are in the order they appear in `cts` after removing all pairs of consecutive duplicates.

    #The program returns the list `a` of length `n` with elements populated based on the values in `odds`. The last value in `odds` is `prev`, and `idx` is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are populated based on the values in `odds`. The function ensures that the sum of the elements at odd indices in the subarrays of `a` matches the values in `odds`. After the function concludes, `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is -1.

    #The program returns the last element of `bigList` after all matching elements from the end of both `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing matching elements from the end of each list until either `smallList` is empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
