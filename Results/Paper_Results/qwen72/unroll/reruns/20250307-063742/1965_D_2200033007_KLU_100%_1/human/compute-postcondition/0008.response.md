Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are populated based on the values in `odds`. The function ensures that the sum of the elements at odd indices in the subarrays of `a` matches the values in `odds`. After the function concludes, `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is -1. **
