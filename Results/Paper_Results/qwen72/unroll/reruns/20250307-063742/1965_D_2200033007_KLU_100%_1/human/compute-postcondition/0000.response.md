To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **`len(smallList) > 0`**: This condition checks if `smallList` is not empty. If `smallList` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `smallList` must contain at least one element.
2. **`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**: This condition checks if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. For the loop to execute, these two elements must be equal.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure:
- `smallList` is not empty.
- The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it is possible for `smallList` to be empty if it is a subsequence of `bigList` that contains no elements. However, for the loop to execute, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, `smallList` is not empty, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
