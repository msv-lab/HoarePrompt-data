The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds` and `n`. `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a hidden palindrome array, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, representing the size of the array `a`. The function returns a list `a` of length `n` with elements populated based on the values in `odds`. The last value in `odds` is used as `prev`, and `idx` is set to -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `a` of length `n` with elements populated based on the values in `odds`.**
