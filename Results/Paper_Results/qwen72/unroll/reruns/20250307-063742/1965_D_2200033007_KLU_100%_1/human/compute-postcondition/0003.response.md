The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList` and `smallList`. Both `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, and `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after all matching elements from the end of both `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. It returns the last element of `bigList` after removing all matching elements from the end of both lists.**
