You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of sublists of `a`, where each sublist starts from an index `i` in `a` and extends to the end of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are populated based on the values in `odds`. The function ensures that the sum of the elements at odd indices in the subarrays of `a` matches the values in `odds`. After the function concludes, `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is -1.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList` after all matching elements from the end of both `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing matching elements from the end of each list until either `smallList` is empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function computes the sums of all subarrays of the array `a`.
   - It iterates over each starting index `i` and each ending index `j` (where `j >= i`), computes the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j`, and appends it to the list `cts`.
   - After computing all subarray sums, it sorts the list `cts`.
   - This function is correct for generating and sorting all subarray sums.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the missing subarray sum by using the fact that in a palindrome, each subarray sum (except the middle element if `n` is odd) should appear an even number of times.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and maintains a list `odds` that keeps track of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a sum appears twice consecutively, it removes the last element from `odds` (since it has been seen an even number of times).
   - This function is correct for identifying the missing subarray sum, which will be the only element left in `odds`.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the `odds` list, starting from the middle of the array `a` and moving outward.
   - For each sum `x` in `odds`, it assigns the value `(x - prev) // 2` to the current index and its symmetric index in `a`.
   - If `n` is odd and `idx` is the middle index, it directly assigns `x` to `a[idx]`.
   - This function is correct for reconstructing the palindrome array `a`.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is not directly used in the main logic of the problem, but it seems to be a utility function for finding the first element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`.
   - It iterates from the end of both lists, removing the last elements if they are equal.
   - It returns the last element of `bigList` after the loop.
   - This function is not necessary for the given problem, as the missing sum is already identified by `func_2`.

### Overall Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum using `func_2`.
- It then correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using `func_3`.
- The utility function `func_4` is not used in the main logic, so its correctness is irrelevant to the problem.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the program is correct and will produce the desired output for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
