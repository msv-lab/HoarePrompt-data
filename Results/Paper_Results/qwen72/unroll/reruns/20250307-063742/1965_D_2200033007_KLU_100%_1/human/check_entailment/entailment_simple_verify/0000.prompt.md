You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input list of subarray sums does not contain the sum of a subarray that includes the middle element of the palindrome. For example, consider the input where `n = 5` and the subarray sums are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1`. The missing sum in this case is `4` for the subarray `[2, 2]`. However, the program will incorrectly reconstruct the array as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which does not satisfy the condition that the missing sum is `4`.

Let's break down the issue:
1. **func_1**: This function correctly generates all subarray sums for a given array `a`.
2. **func_2**: This function correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times, which should help in identifying the missing sum.
3. **func_3**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd sums. However, it assumes that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is the first odd sum encountered, which may not always be the case.
4. **func_4**: This function is not used in the reconstruction process and seems to be unrelated to the problem.

The issue lies in **func_3**. The program does not correctly handle the reconstruction when the missing sum is for a subarray that includes the middle element of the palindrome. This can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated in the example above.
