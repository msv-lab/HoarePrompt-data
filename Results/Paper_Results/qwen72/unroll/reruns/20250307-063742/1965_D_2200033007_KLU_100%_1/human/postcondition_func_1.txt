The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing the elements from `cts` that do not have a matching preceding element in `cts` (i.e., elements that appear an odd number of times in `cts`). The elements in `odds` are in the order they appear in `cts` after removing all pairs of consecutive duplicates.
