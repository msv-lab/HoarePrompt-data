### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a hidden palindrome array `a` of size `n` given all but one of its subarray sums.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n + 1 - i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a)`:**
     - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`.
     - It iterates through each possible subarray starting from each index `i` to the end of the array and calculates the sum.
     - The resulting list `cts` is sorted and returned.
     - This function is correct for generating and sorting subarray sums.

   - **`func_2(cts)`:**
     - This function identifies the elements in `cts` that appear an odd number of times.
     - It uses a stack-like approach to remove consecutive duplicates and keep the unique elements.
     - The resulting list `odds` contains the sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - This function is correct for identifying the odd-appearing sums.

   - **`func_3(odds, n)`:**
     - This function constructs the palindrome array `a` based on the `odds` list.
     - It populates the array `a` by distributing the values in `odds` symmetrically.
     - The function ensures that the sum of the elements at odd indices in the subarrays of `a` matches the values in `odds`.
     - This function is correct for constructing the palindrome array.

   - **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`:**
     - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the `bigList` (all subarray sums) and `smallList` (given subarray sums).
     - It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until a mismatch is found.
     - The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process.
     - This function is correct for identifying the missing subarray sum.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is to:
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, read the size `n` and the subarray sums `subarraySums`.
     - Sort `subarraySums` and identify the odd-appearing sums using `func_2`.
     - Determine the missing subarray sum using `func_4` and the logic provided.
     - Construct the palindrome array `a` using `func_3` and the identified sums.
     - Print the constructed array `a`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `n` and the number of test cases.
   - The logic for handling odd and even lengths of `odds` is correctly implemented to ensure the palindrome property is maintained.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are implemented correctly and work together to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
