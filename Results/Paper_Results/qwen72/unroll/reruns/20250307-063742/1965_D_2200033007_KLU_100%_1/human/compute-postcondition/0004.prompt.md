You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, and smallList is a subsequence of bigList.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList and smallList are modified such that all the matching elements from the end of both lists are removed. The loop stops when either smallList is empty or the last elements of bigList and smallList no longer match.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList` after all matching elements from the end of both `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. It returns the last element of `bigList` after removing all matching elements from the end of both lists.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of `bigList` after all matching elements from the end of both `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
