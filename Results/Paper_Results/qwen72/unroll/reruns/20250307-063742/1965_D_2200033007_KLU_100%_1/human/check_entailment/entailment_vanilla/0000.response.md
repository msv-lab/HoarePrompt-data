### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function computes the sums of all subarrays of the array `a`.
   - It iterates over each starting index `i` and each ending index `j` (where `j >= i`), computes the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j`, and appends it to the list `cts`.
   - After computing all subarray sums, it sorts the list `cts`.
   - This function is correct for generating and sorting all subarray sums.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the missing subarray sum by using the fact that in a palindrome, each subarray sum (except the middle element if `n` is odd) should appear an even number of times.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and maintains a list `odds` that keeps track of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a sum appears twice consecutively, it removes the last element from `odds` (since it has been seen an even number of times).
   - This function is correct for identifying the missing subarray sum, which will be the only element left in `odds`.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the `odds` list, starting from the middle of the array `a` and moving outward.
   - For each sum `x` in `odds`, it assigns the value `(x - prev) // 2` to the current index and its symmetric index in `a`.
   - If `n` is odd and `idx` is the middle index, it directly assigns `x` to `a[idx]`.
   - This function is correct for reconstructing the palindrome array `a`.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is not directly used in the main logic of the problem, but it seems to be a utility function for finding the first element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`.
   - It iterates from the end of both lists, removing the last elements if they are equal.
   - It returns the last element of `bigList` after the loop.
   - This function is not necessary for the given problem, as the missing sum is already identified by `func_2`.

### Overall Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum using `func_2`.
- It then correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using `func_3`.
- The utility function `func_4` is not used in the main logic, so its correctness is irrelevant to the problem.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the program is correct and will produce the desired output for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
