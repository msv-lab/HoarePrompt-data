Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input list of subarray sums does not contain the sum of a subarray that includes the middle element of the palindrome. For example, consider the input where `n = 5` and the subarray sums are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1`. The missing sum in this case is `4` for the subarray `[2, 2]`. However, the program will incorrectly reconstruct the array as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which does not satisfy the condition that the missing sum is `4`.

Let's break down the issue:
1. **func_1**: This function correctly generates all subarray sums for a given array `a`.
2. **func_2**: This function correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times, which should help in identifying the missing sum.
3. **func_3**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd sums. However, it assumes that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is the first odd sum encountered, which may not always be the case.
4. **func_4**: This function is not used in the reconstruction process and seems to be unrelated to the problem.

The issue lies in **func_3**. The program does not correctly handle the reconstruction when the missing sum is for a subarray that includes the middle element of the palindrome. This can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated in the example above.
