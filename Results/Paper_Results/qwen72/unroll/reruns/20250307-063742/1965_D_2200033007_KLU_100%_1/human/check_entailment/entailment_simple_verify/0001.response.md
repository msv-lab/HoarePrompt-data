### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function correctly computes and returns the sorted list of all subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - The nested loops ensure that all subarrays are considered, and the cumulative sum is correctly computed and appended to `cts`.
   - The final sorting step ensures that the list of subarray sums is in ascending order.
   - **Correct**.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function is designed to identify the sums that appear an odd number of times in the list `cts`.
   - The logic of pushing and popping elements from `odds` ensures that only sums that appear an odd number of times remain in the list.
   - However, the function does not directly identify the missing sum. Instead, it identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times, which is a step towards finding the missing sum.
   - **Correct** for its intended purpose.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`).
   - The logic of assigning values to the middle and symmetric indices is correct for constructing a palindrome.
   - The function correctly handles both even and odd lengths of `n`.
   - **Correct**.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the sorted list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - The function iterates from the end of both lists, removing matching elements, and returns the last element of `bigList` that does not match with `smallList`.
   - This approach is valid for finding the missing sum, but it is not the most efficient or straightforward way to do so, especially given that `func_2` already identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Correct** but not necessary for the main logic.

### Main Logic Analysis:
- The main logic of the program is to identify the missing subarray sum and then reconstruct the palindrome array.
- The program correctly uses `func_2` to identify the sums that appear an odd number of times.
- The logic for determining the missing sum is a bit convoluted:
  - If the length of `odds` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it attempts to determine the missing sum by separating the sums into odd and even values and then choosing the first element from one of these lists.
  - If the length of `odds` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it reconstructs a smaller palindrome array and uses `func_4` to find the missing sum.
- The program then appends the missing sum to `odds`, sorts it, and calls `func_2` again to ensure the missing sum is correctly identified.
- Finally, it reconstructs the palindrome array using `func_3`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- The main issue is the complexity and redundancy in determining the missing sum. The program could be simplified by directly using the result from `func_2` to find the missing sum.
- The separation of sums into odd and even values and the use of `func_4` are unnecessary and can be removed.

### Simplified Main Logic:
- Use `func_2` to identify the sums that appear an odd number of times.
- The missing sum will be the only element in `odds` that does not have a pair.
- Append the missing sum to `odds`, sort it, and call `func_2` again to ensure the missing sum is correctly identified.
- Reconstruct the palindrome array using `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is mostly correct, but it could be improved by simplifying the logic for determining the missing sum. The program is correct in its current form, but it is not as efficient or straightforward as it could be.

Final: **True**
