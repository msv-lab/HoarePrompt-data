Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum score by repeatedly selecting two numbers from a list of 2n numbers and adding the minimum of the two to the score. The key insight is that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest numbers together. This ensures that the smaller numbers are added to the score as many times as possible, while the larger numbers are minimized in their contribution to the score.

The program sorts the list of numbers and then sums the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This approach works because after sorting, the smallest numbers will be at the beginning of the list. By summing the elements at even indices, you are effectively summing the smaller number from each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list.

For example:
- In the first test case, the sorted list is `[2, 3]`. The element at index 0 is `2`, which is the minimum of the pair `(2, 3)`, and the score is `2`.
- In the second test case, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The elements at indices 0 and 2 are `1` and `1`, which are the minimums of the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, and the score is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- In the third test case, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The elements at indices 0, 2, and 4 are `1`, `1`, and `1`, which are the minimums of the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`, and the score is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
