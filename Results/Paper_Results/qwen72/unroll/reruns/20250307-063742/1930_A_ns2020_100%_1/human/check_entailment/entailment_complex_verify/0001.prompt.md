You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and `A` is the last sorted list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers (each between `1` and `10^7`). The function sorts the list and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being `0`, `n` being the last input integer, and `A` being the last sorted list of `2n` integers. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves selecting pairs of integers from a list of 2n integers and adding the minimum of each pair to a score.
   - The goal is to maximize the score after performing this operation n times.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided solution sorts the list of integers.
   - It then sums up every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list.
   - The idea behind this approach is that by sorting the list, the smallest elements will be paired together, ensuring that the minimum value of each pair is as large as possible.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sorting the List:**
     - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together. This is crucial because the minimum value of each pair should be maximized to achieve the highest score.
   - **Summing Every Second Element:**
     - After sorting, the list is divided into pairs of consecutive elements. The first element of each pair (i.e., every second element starting from the first) is the minimum of that pair.
     - By summing these elements, we are effectively summing the minimum values of all pairs, which is the desired outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Test Case:**
     - The program correctly handles a single test case by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The program uses a while loop to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate.
   - **Small and Large n:**
     - The program works for both small and large values of n within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the number of integers for each test case correctly.
   - It reads the list of integers and processes them as required.
   - The output is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs, which is the correct result for each test case.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list and sums the minimum values of each pair, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
