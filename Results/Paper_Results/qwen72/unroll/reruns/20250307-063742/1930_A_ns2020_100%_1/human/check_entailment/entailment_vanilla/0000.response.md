### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves selecting pairs of integers from a list of 2n integers and adding the minimum of each pair to a score.
   - The goal is to maximize the score after performing this operation n times.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided solution sorts the list of integers.
   - It then sums up every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list.
   - The idea behind this approach is that by sorting the list, the smallest elements will be paired together, ensuring that the minimum value of each pair is as large as possible.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sorting the List:**
     - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together. This is crucial because the minimum value of each pair should be maximized to achieve the highest score.
   - **Summing Every Second Element:**
     - After sorting, the list is divided into pairs of consecutive elements. The first element of each pair (i.e., every second element starting from the first) is the minimum of that pair.
     - By summing these elements, we are effectively summing the minimum values of all pairs, which is the desired outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Test Case:**
     - The program correctly handles a single test case by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The program uses a while loop to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate.
   - **Small and Large n:**
     - The program works for both small and large values of n within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the number of integers for each test case correctly.
   - It reads the list of integers and processes them as required.
   - The output is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs, which is the correct result for each test case.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list and sums the minimum values of each pair, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

Correctness: **True**
