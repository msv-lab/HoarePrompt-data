The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers (each between `1` and `10^7`). The function sorts the list and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being `0`, `n` being the last input integer, and `A` being the last sorted list of `2n` integers. The function does not return any value.
