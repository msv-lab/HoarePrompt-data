The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers, where each integer `a_i` has a value between 1 and 10^7. The function returns a result based on these inputs.
