Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Summing Minimums**: The program calculates the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A[::2]`. This is correct because in a sorted list, the minimum of each pair will always be at an even index when considering pairs from the start.
4. **Output**: It prints the sum, which is the maximum score achievable for that test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly processes multiple test cases.
- It handles the case where `n` is 1.
- It handles the case where all integers are the same.
- It handles the case where the integers are distinct and sorted in any order.

Since the program works correctly for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
