Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score by performing the specified move exactly \( n \) times on a list of \( 2n \) integers. The key insight is that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number and take the minimum of the pair. This is because the minimum value in each pair will be added to the score, and by pairing the smallest numbers together, you ensure that the larger numbers are not wasted.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and a list of \( 2n \) integers.
3. It sorts the list \( A \).
4. It prints the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list.

The sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list is equivalent to summing the smallest \( n \) elements of the list. This is because the sorted list will have the smallest elements at the beginning, and taking every second element (starting from the first) will give you the smallest \( n \) elements. This approach ensures that you are always taking the minimum of each pair, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
