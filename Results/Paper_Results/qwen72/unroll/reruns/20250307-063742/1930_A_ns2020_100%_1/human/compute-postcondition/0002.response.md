Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and `A` is the last sorted list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` starts with an initial value and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The variable `n` is updated in each iteration to a new input integer, and after the loop finishes, `n` will hold the last input value provided.
- The list `A` is updated in each iteration to a new list of 2n integers, which is then sorted. After the loop finishes, `A` will hold the last sorted list of 2n integers provided in the input.
