Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
4. **Summing the Minimum Values**: It then sums up every second element starting from the first element (i.e., the elements at even indices in the sorted list). This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be one of the first `n` elements.

The logic of summing the first `n` elements of the sorted list is correct because:
- When the list is sorted, the smallest `n` elements will be the ones that are always chosen as the minimum in each pair.
- By summing these `n` elements, you ensure that you are adding the smallest possible values to your score, which maximizes the total score.

Thus, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.
