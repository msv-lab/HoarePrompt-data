### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - The array `a` is then sorted.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - For an odd-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`, which is the middle index.
   - For an even-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`, which is the first of the two middle indices.

3. **Operation Counting**:
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations needed to increase the median.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element from `mdx` to the end of the array, if the element is equal to the median element `a[mdx]`, it increments `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `res` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Increasing Median**:
  - The program does not correctly implement the logic to increase the median. It only counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median element.
  - To increase the median, the program should focus on the element at the median index and the elements immediately following it (if the array length is even). It should count the number of operations needed to make the median element greater than its current value.
  - The current logic does not account for the actual operations needed to increase the median, which involves incrementing the median element or the elements that contribute to the median.

### Correct Implementation:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
  - Identify the median element.
  - Determine the smallest element greater than the median element.
  - Count the number of operations needed to make the median element equal to this smallest element greater than the median.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
