The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5**
