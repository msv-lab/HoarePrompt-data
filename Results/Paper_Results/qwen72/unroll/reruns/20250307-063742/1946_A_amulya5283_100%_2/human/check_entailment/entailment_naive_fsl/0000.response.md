Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. Specifically, the logic in the loop:
```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
    if a[mdx] == a[i]:
        res += 1
```
is incorrect. This loop increments `res` for every element in the array that is equal to the current median, but it should instead calculate the number of operations needed to increase the median to the next distinct value in the sorted array.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 3 4
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, and the median is `3`. To increase the median, we need to make the second `3` (at index `3` in the sorted array) greater than `3`. The correct number of operations needed is `1` (increment the second `3` to `4`). However, the given program will output `2` because it incorrectly counts the number of elements equal to the median, rather than the number of operations needed to increase the median.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
