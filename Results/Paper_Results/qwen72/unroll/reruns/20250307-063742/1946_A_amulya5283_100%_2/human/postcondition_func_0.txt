The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a list, followed by `n` integers which it sorts. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of elements in the sorted list that are equal to the median element from the median position to the end of the list and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer, `a` being the last sorted list of integers, and `res` being the last calculated count.
