### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - The array `a` is then sorted.

2. **Special Case for Single Element**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 1. This is correct because the median of a single-element array is the element itself, and to increase it, you need exactly one operation.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array:
     - For odd `n`, `n // 2` gives the middle index, and `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` is `n // 2`.
     - For even `n`, `n // 2` gives the first of the two middle indices, and `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` is `n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Counting Operations**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element `a[i]` from `mdx` to `n-1`, if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, it increments `res` by 1.
   - This logic is incorrect because it counts the number of elements equal to the median, rather than the number of operations required to increase the median.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - To increase the median, you need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and determine how many operations are required to make the median equal to this number.
   - The correct approach would be to find the next distinct number greater than the current median and calculate the difference between this number and the current median. The number of operations required would be the sum of these differences for all elements from the median position to the end of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach involves finding the next distinct number greater than the median and calculating the operations needed to make the median equal to this number.
