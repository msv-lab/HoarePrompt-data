Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This formula correctly determines the median index for both even and odd lengths of the array:
     - For odd `n`, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`, which is the middle index.
     - For even `n`, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`, which is the first of the two middle indices.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The program initializes `res` to 0.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element `a[i]` from `mdx` to `n-1`, if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, it increments `res`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `res` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array is necessary to find the median, and the program does this correctly.
- **Median Index Calculation**: The calculation of the median index is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array.
- **Operation Counting**: The program counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median. However, this logic is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not to count the number of elements equal to the median.

### Correct Logic:
- To increase the median, we need to increase the value of the element at the median index `mdx` to the next distinct value in the sorted array.
- If the array has distinct elements, we need to find the smallest element greater than `a[mdx]` and calculate the difference.
- If the array has repeated elements, we need to ensure that the median is increased to the next distinct value.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Array: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Sorted: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Median index: `1` (value `2`)
  - Next distinct value: `8`
  - Operations needed: `1` (increase `2` to `3`)

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Array: `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`
  - Sorted: `[4, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - Median index: `2` (value `5`)
  - Next distinct value: `6` (since we need to increase the median)
  - Operations needed: `3` (increase `5` to `6`)

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            next_distinct_value = a[mdx] + 1
            while next_distinct_value in a[mdx+1:]:
                next_distinct_value += 1
            res = next_distinct_value - a[mdx]
            print(res)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It only counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is not the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
