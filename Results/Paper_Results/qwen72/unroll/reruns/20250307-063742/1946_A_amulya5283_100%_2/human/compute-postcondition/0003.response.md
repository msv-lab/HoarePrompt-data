The function `func` is intended to accept a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as inputs, along with the number of test cases `t`. However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters. Given the constraints, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `a` and its length `n`. The integers in the list `a` are within the range 1 to 10^9, and the length `n` is a positive integer up to 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer up to 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.

The function's output is not specified in the problem description, but based on the context, it is likely that the function returns some result for each test case, possibly related to the list `a` and its length `n`.

Functionality: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers `a` and its length `n`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
