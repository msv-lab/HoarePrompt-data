#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should take a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as inputs. The input `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of integers sorted, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median element from the median position to the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a list, followed by `n` integers which it sorts. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of elements in the sorted list that are equal to the median element from the median position to the end of the list and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer, `a` being the last sorted list of integers, and `res` being the last calculated count.
