Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should take a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as inputs. The input `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
