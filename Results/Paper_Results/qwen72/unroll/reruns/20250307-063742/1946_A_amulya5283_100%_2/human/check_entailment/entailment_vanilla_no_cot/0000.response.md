Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of elements that are equal to the median, but it does not actually calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Here are the issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The program counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is not the correct approach. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not just to count how many elements are equal to it.

2. **Handling the Median Increase**: The program does not consider the next possible value for the median and how many operations are needed to make the current median reach that value.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are the same.

A correct approach would involve:
- Sorting the array.
- Identifying the current median.
- Determining the next possible value for the median that is greater than the current median.
- Calculating the minimum number of operations required to make the current median reach the next possible value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            next_median = current_median + 1
            
            # Find the next possible median value
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] < next_median:
                mdx += 1
            
            # Calculate the number of operations needed
            operations = 0
            for i in range(n // 2, mdx):
                operations += next_median - a[i]
            
            print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Sorts the array.
- Identifies the current median.
- Determines the next possible median value.
- Calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the current median reach the next possible value.
