Output State: **`i` is -1, `ans` is updated such that each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is `ans[j+1] - arr[j]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the variable `i` will be -1 because the loop decrements `i` until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0. The list `ans` will be updated such that each element `ans[j]` (for 0 <= j < n-1) is set to the value of `ans[j+1]` minus the corresponding element `arr[j]`. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged at 1000000000.
