Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the current element in `arr`. The final element of `ans` is always `10 ** 9`. The initial value of `i` is `n - 2` and is decremented to -1 during the execution, but this does not affect the returned list `ans`. **
