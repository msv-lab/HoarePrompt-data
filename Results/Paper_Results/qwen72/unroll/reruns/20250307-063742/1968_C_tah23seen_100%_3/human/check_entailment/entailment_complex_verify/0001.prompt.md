You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is -1, `ans` is updated such that each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is `ans[j+1] - arr[j]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is calculated as `ans[j+1] - arr[j]`. The initial value of `i` is -1, but it does not affect the returned list `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the current element in `arr`. The final element of `ans` is always `10


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `arr` and the integer `n` as input.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of size \( n \) with all elements set to \( 10^9 \).
   - It then iterates from \( i = n-2 \) to \( i = 0 \) and sets \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the resulting array `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initialization of `ans`:**
  - The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to \( 10^9 \). This is a valid starting point because \( 10^9 \) is within the allowed range for \( a_i \).

- **Setting `ans[i]`:**
  - The loop sets \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).
  - This means \( ans[i] = ans[i+1] - x_{i+1} \).
  - For \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) to hold, \( a_i \) must be such that when divided by \( a_{i-1} \), the remainder is \( x_i \).
  - The current implementation sets \( a_i \) to \( a_{i+1} - x_{i+1} \). This ensures that \( a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1} \) because \( a_{i+1} = k \cdot a_i + x_{i+1} \) for some integer \( k \).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 2 \) correctly. In this case, \( ans[0] \) is set to \( 10^9 \) and \( ans[1] \) is set to \( 10^9 - x_2 \), which satisfies \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \).

- **Constraints:**
  - The constraints \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) are satisfied because \( ans[i] \) is always set to a value that is within the range \( 1 \) to \( 10^9 \) (since \( ans[i+1] \) is \( 10^9 \) and \( x_{i+1} \) is at most \( 500 \)).

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: \( n = 4 \), \( x_2, x_3, x_4 = 2, 4, 1 \)
  - Output: \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 = 3, 5, 4, 9 \)
  - Verification:
    - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 3 = 2 \)
    - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod 5 = 4 \)
    - \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 9 \bmod 4 = 1 \)
  - The output is correct.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x_2, x_3 = 1, 1 \)
  - Output: \( a_1, a_2, a_3 = 2, 5, 11 \)
  - Verification:
    - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 2 = 1 \)
    - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 11 \bmod 5 = 1 \)
  - The output is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: \( n = 6 \), \( x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6 = 4, 2, 5, 1, 2 \)
  - Output: \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 = 5, 14, 16, 5, 11, 24 \)
  - Verification:
    - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 14 \bmod 5 = 4 \)
    - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 16 \bmod 14 = 2 \)
    - \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 5 \bmod 16 = 5 \)
    - \( a_5 \bmod a_4 = 11 \bmod 5 = 1 \)
    - \( a_6 \bmod a_5 = 24 \bmod 11 = 2 \)
  - The output is correct.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: \( n = 2 \), \( x_2 = 500 \)
  - Output: \( a_1, a_2 = 501, 500 \)
  - Verification:
    - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 500 \bmod 501 = 500 \)
  - The output is correct.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x_2, x_3 = 1, 5 \)
  - Output: \( a_1, a_2, a_3 = 2, 7, 5 \)
  - Verification:
    - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 7 \bmod 2 = 1 \)
    - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 5 \bmod 7 = 5 \)
  - The output is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \) and ensures that \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \). Therefore, the program is correct.
