Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000, `i` is `n - 2`.**

The value of `i` is set to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains integers within the specified range, `n` is still within the specified range, and `ans` is still a list of length `n` with each element set to 1000000000.
