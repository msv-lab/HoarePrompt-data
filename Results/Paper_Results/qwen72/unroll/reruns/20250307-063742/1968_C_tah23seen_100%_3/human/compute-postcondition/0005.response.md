The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. The function returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1 is calculated as the difference between the next element and the current element in the input list `arr` (i.e., `ans[j] = arr[j+1] - arr[j]`).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[j]` is the difference between `arr[j+1]` and `arr[j]` for 0 <= j < n-1.**
