Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array `a` such that for each `x_i` in the input array, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to initialize the array `ans` with a large value (`10^9`) and then update each element in reverse order to satisfy the condition.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: The array `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all elements. This is a reasonable starting point, but the subsequent updates need to be carefully considered.

2. **Update Logic**: The function updates each element `ans[i]` to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is incorrect because:
   - The operation `a_i % a_{i-1}` should yield `x_i`, but the current update logic does not ensure this.
   - The correct approach should be to set `ans[i]` to a value that, when taken modulo `ans[i + 1]`, results in `arr[i]`.

3. **Correct Update Logic**: To satisfy `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`, you can set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + arr[i]` or any multiple of `a_{i-1}` plus `arr[i]` to ensure that the modulo operation yields `arr[i]`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`, the function should generate an array `a` such that:
     - `a_2 % a_1 = 2`
     - `a_3 % a_2 = 4`
     - `a_4 % a_3 = 1`
   - The current implementation sets `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 10^9 - 1`, `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = (10^9 - 1) - 4`, and `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = ((10^9 - 1) - 4) - 2`. This does not satisfy the modulo conditions.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would be to start with a large value for `a_n` and then set each `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + arr[i]` to ensure the modulo condition is met.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
