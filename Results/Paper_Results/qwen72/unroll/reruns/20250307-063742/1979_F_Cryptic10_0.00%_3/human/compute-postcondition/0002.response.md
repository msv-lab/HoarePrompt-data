The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, which is a set. For the loop to execute, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Given the initial state, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. This means `remaining_vertices` is already non-empty, as it contains at least the integers from 1 to 2.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n, `path` is an empty list**
