Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to n in some order.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered output is written immediately to the output device. This does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
