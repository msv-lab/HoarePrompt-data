Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to n in some order.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
- In each iteration of the loop, the code tries to find a vertex `v` using `func_1(d)` that is still in `remaining_vertices`.
- If such a vertex `v` is found, it is added to the `path` list and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- This process repeats until `remaining_vertices` is empty, meaning all vertices from 1 to n have been added to `path`.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set, and `path` will contain all integers from 1 to n, but the order in which they appear in `path` depends on the behavior of `func_1(d)`.
