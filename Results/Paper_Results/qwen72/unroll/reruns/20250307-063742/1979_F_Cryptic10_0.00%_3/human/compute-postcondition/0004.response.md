Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.
- `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to n in some order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`path` Variable**:
   - `path` is a list that contains all integers from 1 to n in some order. This means `path` could be any permutation of the integers from 1 to n.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, `path` could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, or any other permutation of these numbers.

2. **`map(str, path)`**:
   - The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in the `path` list, converting each integer to a string.
   - For example, if `path = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `map(str, path)` will produce an iterator that yields `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.

3. **`' '.join(map(str, path))`**:
   - The `join` method concatenates all the elements of the iterator produced by `map(str, path)` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
   - Continuing the example, `' '.join(['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])` will result in the string `"1 2 3 4 5"`.

4. **`f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}"`**:
   - The `f` string is a formatted string that includes the string `"!"` followed by a space and then the result of `' '.join(map(str, path))`.
   - For the example `path = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the formatted string will be `"! 1 2 3 4 5"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `"!"` followed by a space and then the elements of the `path` list, each separated by a space. The elements of `path` are all integers from 1 to n in some order.

Output: **! 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the length of the path list and the elements are all integers from 1 to n in some order)**
