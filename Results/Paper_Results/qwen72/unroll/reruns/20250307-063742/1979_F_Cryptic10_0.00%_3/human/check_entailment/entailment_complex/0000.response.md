Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor and receiving the response.
   - It prints a query string in the format `"? d"` and reads the response as two integers `v` and `u`.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph by iteratively querying the interactor and removing vertices.
   - It initializes a list `path` to store the vertices in the order they are found and a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that have not been removed yet.
   - The function uses a while loop to continue until all vertices are removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` in descending order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` with the minimum degree at least `d` and a vertex `u` not connected to `v` (or `0` if no such vertex exists).
   - If `v` is `0`, it continues to the next degree.
   - If `v` is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds `v` to the `path`, removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and breaks out of the loop.
   - This process continues until all vertices are removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic of `func_2` is designed to find the Hamiltonian path by iteratively removing vertices with the minimum degree at least `d` and ensuring that the remaining graph still has a Hamiltonian path.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the limit on the number of queries and the requirement to find a Hamiltonian path.
   - The approach of starting with the highest degree and working downwards ensures that the function can find a vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and a vertex not connected to it, which helps in constructing the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the interactor returns `0 0` by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the graph is reduced to a single vertex, which is added to the path and the loop terminates.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
