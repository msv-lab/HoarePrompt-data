The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. It also accepts a parameter `remaining_vertices`, which is a set of integers representing the vertices in a graph, initially containing all integers from 1 to n. The function returns a set of integers representing the vertices that are still remaining in the graph after some operations are performed.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a set `remaining_vertices` of integers from 1 to n. It returns a set of integers representing the vertices that are still remaining in the graph after some operations.**
