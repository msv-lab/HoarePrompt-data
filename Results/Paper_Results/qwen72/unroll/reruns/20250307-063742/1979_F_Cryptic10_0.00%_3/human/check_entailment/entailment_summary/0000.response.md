### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in this graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query `? d` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \) (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
   - The vertex \( v \) is then removed from the graph, and the process continues until we have a Hamiltonian path.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(d)`:**
     - This function sends a query to the interactor with the degree \( d \).
     - It reads the response, which is a tuple of two integers \( (v, u) \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it means no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) exists, and the function continues.
     - If \( v \) is not 0, it returns the tuple \( (v, u) \).

   - **`func_2(n)`:**
     - This function initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
     - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each \( d \), it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex \( v \) and another vertex \( u \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds \( v \) to `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
     - The loop breaks after adding a vertex to `path`.
     - Once all vertices are added to `path`, it prints the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Query Efficiency:**
     - The function `func_2` makes at most \( n \) queries, as it processes one vertex per query and there are \( n \) vertices.
   - **Vertex Selection:**
     - The function starts with the highest degree \( n-1 \) and works its way down to 0. This ensures that it selects vertices with the highest possible degree first, which helps in maintaining the connectivity of the remaining graph.
     - By selecting the vertex with the minimum degree among those with a degree at least \( d \), it ensures that it is removing the least connected vertex first, which is a good strategy for finding a Hamiltonian path.
   - **Path Construction:**
     - The function constructs the path by adding the selected vertex to `path` and removing it from `remaining_vertices`.
     - The process continues until all vertices are added to `path`, ensuring that each vertex is included exactly once.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:**
     - The function correctly handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) exists by continuing to the next degree.
     - It also correctly handles the case where the interactor returns 0 for \( u \), which indicates that the vertex \( v \) is connected to all remaining vertices.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to ensure that the path is constructed correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
