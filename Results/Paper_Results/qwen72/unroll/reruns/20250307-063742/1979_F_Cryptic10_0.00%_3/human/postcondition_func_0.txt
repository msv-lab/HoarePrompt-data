The function `func_1` accepts an integer `d` within the range of 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is the number of vertices in the graph. It prints a query string in the format `"? d"`. The function then reads a line of input from the user, expecting two integers separated by a space, and returns these integers as a tuple `(v, u)`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed query and the returned integers `v` and `u`.
