Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n, `path` is an empty list.**

The code reassigns `remaining_vertices` to a set of integers from 1 to `n`, which is consistent with the initial state where `remaining_vertices` was already described as a set of integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` and the state of `path` remain unchanged.
