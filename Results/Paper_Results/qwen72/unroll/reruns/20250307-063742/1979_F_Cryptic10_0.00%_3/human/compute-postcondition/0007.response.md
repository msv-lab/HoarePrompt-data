Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and operates on a set `remaining_vertices` initially containing integers from 1 to `n`. After the function concludes, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and a list `path` containing all integers from 1 to `n` in some order is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. **
