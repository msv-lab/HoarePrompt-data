Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of mushrooms. v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, representing the magic powers of the mushrooms. p is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n, representing the order in which the magic powers of the mushrooms will become 0 if they are not picked. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is a type variable.**
