You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is given, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is 0, and the loop has processed all the test cases. The variable `n` and array `a` are set to the values of the last test case, and `a` is sorted. The variable `res` is set to the number of elements in the last test case's array `a` that are equal to the median element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the total number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case based on the input array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
