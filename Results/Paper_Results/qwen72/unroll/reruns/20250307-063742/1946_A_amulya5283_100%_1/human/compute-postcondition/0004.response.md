Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the total number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the array `a` and then calculates the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median element. The function prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and the last test case's `n` and `a` values are retained, with `a` being sorted. **
