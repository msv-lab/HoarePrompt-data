Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. The logic in the program is flawed because it only increments the result (`res`) for each element that is equal to the median, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The median of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`. To increase the median, we need to increase the value of the element at the median position (index `2` in the sorted array) to at least `4`. The correct minimum number of operations required is `1` (increment the element at index `2` by `1` to make it `4`). However, the program will output `0` because it does not correctly handle the logic for increasing the median.

Another example:
```
1
4
1 2 3 3
```
The median of the array `[1, 2, 3, 3]` is `2.5` (which is the average of the two middle elements `2` and `3` in the sorted array). To increase the median, we need to increase the value of the element at index `1` (the first middle element) to at least `4`. The correct minimum number of operations required is `2` (increment the element at index `1` by `2` to make it `4`). However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is incorrect.

These examples show that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median for all potential cases.
