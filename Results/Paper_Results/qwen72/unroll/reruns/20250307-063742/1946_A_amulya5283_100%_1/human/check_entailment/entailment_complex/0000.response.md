### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - The array `a` is then sorted.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array:
     - For odd `n`, `n // 2` gives the middle index, and `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` correctly points to the middle element.
     - For even `n`, `n // 2` gives the first of the two middle indices, and `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` correctly points to the first middle element.

3. **Operation Counting:**
   - The function initializes `res` to 0.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element `a[i]` that is equal to the median element `a[mdx]`, it increments `res`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it counts the number of elements equal to the median, rather than the number of operations required to increase the median.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints `res` for each test case.
   - However, `res` does not represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The function is designed to count the number of elements in the array that are equal to the median, but the problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median. The current logic does not address this requirement. Instead, it should find the smallest number of operations needed to make the median element greater than its current value. This typically involves increasing the median element itself or the elements immediately around it to ensure the median increases.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Identify the median element.
2. Determine the smallest number greater than the median.
3. Calculate the number of operations required to make the median element equal to this smallest number greater than the median.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            median = a[mdx]
            next_greater = median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] == median:
                next_greater += 1
                mdx += 1
            if mdx < n:
                operations = (next_greater - median) * (n - mdx)
            else:
                operations = 1  # If all elements are equal to the median, just increase the median by 1
            print(operations)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
