The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the length of an array, and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function accepts the total number of test cases `t` and processes each test case according to the given constraints. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts the total number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case based on the input array `a`.**
