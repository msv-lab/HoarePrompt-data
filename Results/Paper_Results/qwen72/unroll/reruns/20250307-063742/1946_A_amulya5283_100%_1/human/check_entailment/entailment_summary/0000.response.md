Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then counting the number of elements that are equal to the median element. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not actually determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Instead, it counts how many elements are equal to the current median, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the current median of the array.
2. Determine the smallest value greater than the current median that can be reached by incrementing the median or the elements around it.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the median equal to this next value.

The current program does not perform these steps correctly. It simply counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
