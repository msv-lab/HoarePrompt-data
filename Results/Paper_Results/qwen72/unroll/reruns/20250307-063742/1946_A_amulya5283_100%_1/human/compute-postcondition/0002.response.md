Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the loop has processed all the test cases. The variable `n` and array `a` are set to the values of the last test case, and `a` is sorted. The variable `res` is set to the number of elements in the last test case's array `a` that are equal to the median element.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs until `t` becomes 0, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers.
- The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- If `n` is 1, the loop prints 1, as the single element is its own median.
- For `n` greater than 1, the loop calculates the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median element (the middle element in the sorted array) and prints this count.
- After the loop finishes, `t` is 0, `n` and `a` are set to the values of the last test case, and `a` is sorted. The variable `res` holds the count of elements equal to the median for the last test case.
