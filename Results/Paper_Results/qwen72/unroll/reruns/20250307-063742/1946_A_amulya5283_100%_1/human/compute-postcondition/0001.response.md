The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is now an input integer, and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already constrained to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once without any adjustment.

State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is given, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is now an input integer.**
