### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`.
   - Sorting is necessary to determine the median of the array.
   - This step is correct.

3. **Handling Single Element Arrays**:
   - If `n == 1`, the function prints `1` because the only element in the array can be increased by 1 to make it the new median.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Finding the Median**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This formula correctly calculates the median index for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - For an odd-length array, `n // 2` gives the middle index, and `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` is `n // 2`.
   - For an even-length array, `n // 2` gives the first of the two middle indices, and `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - This is correct.

5. **Counting Operations**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element `a[i]` that is equal to `a[mdx]`, it increments `res` by 1.
   - This logic is incorrect. The goal is to increase the median, not to count the number of elements equal to the median.
   - To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and determine how many operations are needed to make the current median equal to that number.

### Corrected Logic:
- To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to that number.
- If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle element.
- If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but we only need to consider the second middle element for the purpose of increasing the median.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            next_greater = current_median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] < next_greater:
                mdx += 1
            if mdx < n:
                operations = (next_greater - a[n // 2])
            else:
                operations = 1  # If all elements are equal to the current median, we need at least one operation to increase it.
            print(operations)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
- The corrected program correctly identifies the smallest number greater than the current median and calculates the number of operations needed to increase the median.

**Correctness: False**
