### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Value of `a`**:
   - The program initializes `a` with a single element `[1000]`. This is a fixed value and does not depend on the input, which might be a problem. The value `1000` is chosen arbitrarily, and it might not always ensure that the conditions are met, especially for larger values of `x_i`.

2. **Loop to Construct `a`**:
   - The program iterates from `1` to `n-1` and constructs the array `a` by appending `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to `a`. This means that each new element `a[i]` is calculated as the previous element minus the corresponding `x_i` value.
   - This approach is incorrect because the modulo operation `a_i % a_{i-1}` should yield `x_i`, but the current logic does not ensure this. Specifically, `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` does not guarantee that `a[i] % a_{i-1} == x_i`.

3. **Reversing the List**:
   - The list `a` is reversed before printing. This is necessary because the array `a` is constructed in reverse order. However, the initial construction logic is flawed, so reversing it does not fix the underlying issue.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the reversed list `a` as a space-separated string. If the construction logic were correct, this would be the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because the logic used to construct the array `a` does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

### Correctness: **False**
