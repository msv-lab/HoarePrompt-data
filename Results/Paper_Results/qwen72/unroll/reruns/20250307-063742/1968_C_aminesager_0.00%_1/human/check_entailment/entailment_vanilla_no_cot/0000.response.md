Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it constructs the array `a`. Specifically, the line `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` does not correctly compute the values of `a` based on the given problem description. The correct approach should be to ensure that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The current implementation subtracts `T[i - 1]` from `a[i - 1]`, which does not guarantee that the modulus condition will be satisfied.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that ensures the modulus condition is met:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]  # Start with an arbitrary large value for a1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(T[i] + a[i])  # Ensure a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Start with `a[0] = 1000` (or any value greater than 500, since `x_i` can be at most 500).
- **Construction of `a`**:
  - For each `x_i` in the input, compute `a[i]` as `T[i] + a[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i]`, because `a[i]` is exactly `T[i]` more than a multiple of `a[i-1]`.
- **Output**: Print the constructed array `a`.

This corrected program will correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.
