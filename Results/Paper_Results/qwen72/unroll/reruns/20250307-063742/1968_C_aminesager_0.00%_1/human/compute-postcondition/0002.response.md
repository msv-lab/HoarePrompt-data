Output State: **t = 0, n is unchanged, x is unchanged, and a is a list of n integers where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from the input list T from the previous element in the list a, starting with 1000. The list a is then reversed and printed as a space-separated string.**

### Explanation:
- **t = 0**: The loop continues to execute until `t` is decremented to 0. After the loop finishes, `t` will be 0.
- **n is unchanged**: The variable `n` is read from input inside the loop, but it is not modified within the loop body. Therefore, its value remains the same as it was when read from input.
- **x is unchanged**: The variable `x` is not used or modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- **a**: The list `a` is constructed by starting with the value 1000 and then iteratively subtracting each element of the input list `T` from the previous element in `a`. After the loop, `a` is reversed, and the resulting list is printed as a space-separated string. The final state of `a` will be a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of the subtraction process, and the list is reversed.
