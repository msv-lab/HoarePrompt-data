You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n-1` integers `T`. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`, starting with 1000. The list `a` is reversed and printed as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function concludes. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that:
   - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
   - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the array \( a \) with a single element \( 1000 \). This is a starting point for constructing the array \( a \).

3. **Array Construction:**
   - The program iterates through the elements of \( x \) and constructs the array \( a \) by appending \( a[i-1] - T[i-1] \) to \( a \).
   - This step is incorrect because it does not correctly compute \( a_i \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

4. **Reversing the Array:**
   - The program reverses the array \( a \) before printing it. This is necessary because the array \( a \) is constructed in reverse order.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array \( a \).

### Correctness Issues:
- **Incorrect Array Construction:**
  - The program uses \( a[i-1] - T[i-1] \) to compute \( a_i \). This is incorrect because \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) should be equal to \( x_i \), not \( a_{i-1} - x_i \).
  - The correct approach should be to ensure that \( a_i \) is a number such that when divided by \( a_{i-1} \), the remainder is \( x_i \). One simple way to achieve this is to set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).

### Corrected Approach:
- Initialize \( a_1 \) with a value that is greater than or equal to the maximum \( x_i \) to ensure all \( a_i \) are within the valid range.
- For each \( x_i \), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [T[0] + 1]  # Initialize a_1 to be greater than the first x value
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - \( a_1 \) is set to \( T[0] + 1 \) to ensure \( a_1 \) is greater than the first \( x \) value.
- **Array Construction:**
  - For each \( x_i \), \( a_i \) is set to \( a_{i-1} + x_i \). This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \).
- **Output:**
  - The constructed array \( a \) is printed.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the array \( a \) to satisfy the given conditions. The corrected program should be used instead.
