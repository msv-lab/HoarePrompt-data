The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n-1` integers `T`. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`, starting with 1000. The list `a` is reversed and printed as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function concludes. The function does not return any value.
