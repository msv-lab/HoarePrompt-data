Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Description**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with `n` piles of stones.
   - On each turn, a player selects a positive integer `k` (at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) and removes `k` stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob wins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile, stored in `arr`.

2. **Processing**:
   - The program converts `arr` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order.
   - It appends a `0` to the end of the sorted list to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `dp` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list (excluding the last element) and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive elements.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Set Conversion and Sorting**:
   - Converting `arr` to a set removes duplicates, ensuring that we only consider distinct pile sizes.
   - Sorting in descending order helps in comparing the differences between consecutive pile sizes.

2. **Appending Zero**:
   - Appending `0` to the end of the sorted list ensures that the last element is always `0`, which simplifies the logic for the last comparison.

3. **Boolean Variable `dp`**:
   - The variable `dp` is used to track the winning condition.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list and updates `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - This condition checks if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1 or if the current value of `dp` is `False`.

4. **Logic Explanation**:
   - If the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, it means there is a gap, and the player whose turn it is can force the opponent into a losing position.
   - The `or not dp` part ensures that the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes is correctly tracked.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise, which aligns with the winning strategy based on the parity of distinct pile sizes.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 3 3 3 3`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[3]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 1 (odd)
  - Alice wins.
- **Test Case 2**: `1 7`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[7, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 2 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[100, 9, 7, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 6 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 2 3`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[3, 2, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 3 (odd)
  - Alice wins.
- **Test Case 5**: `2 1 3 4 2 4`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 4 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 6**: `5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[9, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 6 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 7**: `1000000000`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[1000000000]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 1 (odd)
  - Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
