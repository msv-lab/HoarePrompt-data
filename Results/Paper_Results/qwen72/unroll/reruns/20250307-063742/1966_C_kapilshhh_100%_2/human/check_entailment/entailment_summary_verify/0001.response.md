### Reasoning:

1. **Set Conversion and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly converts the list of pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order. This ensures that we only consider distinct pile sizes and that the largest pile sizes are processed first.

2. **Appending Zero**:
   - Appending `0` to the end of the sorted list is a clever trick to handle the edge case where the last element is being compared. This ensures that the loop always has a valid next element to compare against.

3. **Boolean Variable `dp`**:
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True` and is used to track the winning condition. The loop iterates through the sorted list (excluding the last element) and updates `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` checks if there is a gap between consecutive pile sizes. If there is a gap, it means the player whose turn it is can force the opponent into a losing position.
   - The `or not dp` part ensures that the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes is correctly tracked. If `dp` is `True`, it means the current player (Alice) can force a win. If `dp` is `False`, it means the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, and Bob will win.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise, which aligns with the winning strategy based on the parity of distinct pile sizes.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 3 3 3 3`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[3]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 1 (odd)
  - Alice wins.
- **Test Case 2**: `1 7`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[7, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 2 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[100, 9, 7, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 6 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 2 3`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[3, 2, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 3 (odd)
  - Alice wins.
- **Test Case 5**: `2 1 3 4 2 4`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 4 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 6**: `5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[9, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 6 (even)
  - Bob wins.
- **Test Case 7**: `1000000000`
  - Distinct pile sizes: `[1000000000]`
  - Number of distinct pile sizes: 1 (odd)
  - Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
