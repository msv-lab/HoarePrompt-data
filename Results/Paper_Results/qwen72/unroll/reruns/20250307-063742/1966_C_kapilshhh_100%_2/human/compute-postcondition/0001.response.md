The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. Since `tc` is already within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`func` is expected to take input through standard input, where the first line contains an integer `tc` (1 ≤ `tc` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `tc` test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
