### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Processing the Piles**:
   - The function converts the list of stones into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order. This is done to ensure that the piles are processed from the largest to the smallest.
   - An extra `0` is appended to the end of the sorted list to handle edge cases where the smallest pile might be the only one left.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Logic**:
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, indicating that Alice starts the game.
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of piles (excluding the last `0`), and for each pile, it updates the `dp` variable based on the difference between the current pile and the next pile.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` is used to determine if the current player (Alice or Bob) can force a win. If the difference between the current pile and the next pile is greater than 1, the current player can always choose a `k` that will leave the next player in a losing position. If the difference is 1 or less, the current player cannot force a win, and the game state alternates.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all the piles for a test case, the function prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where there is only one pile or multiple piles with the same number of stones correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where the smallest pile is the only one left by appending `0` to the list.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The function processes each test case in \(O(n \log n)\) time due to the sorting step, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. The use of dynamic programming and the sorting of unique pile sizes ensures that the function can handle all valid inputs and produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
