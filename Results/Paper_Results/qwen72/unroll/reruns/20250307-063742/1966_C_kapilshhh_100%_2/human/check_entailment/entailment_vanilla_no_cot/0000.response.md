Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. The logic of the program is to determine the winner by checking if the difference between the sizes of any two consecutive piles (after removing duplicates and sorting in reverse order) is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, Alice can always win by playing optimally. Otherwise, Bob will win. This approach is consistent with the optimal play strategy for the game described.
