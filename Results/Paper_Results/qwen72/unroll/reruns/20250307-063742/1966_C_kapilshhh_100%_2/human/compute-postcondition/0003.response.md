The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters but reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case includes two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is typically expected to be some form of output based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
