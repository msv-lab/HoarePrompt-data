The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins a game based on the piles of stones and prints the winner. The function processes all test cases and exits once all have been processed. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been read and processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. The variables `tc`, `n`, `arr`, and `dp` are not preserved between test cases and are redefined for each iteration.
