Output State: **The variable `tc` is 0, and the loop has processed all the test cases. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `dp` are not preserved between iterations and are redefined in each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `tc` times, and with each iteration, `tc` is decremented by 1. After all iterations, `tc` will be 0.
- In each iteration, `n` is read from the input and represents the number of piles for that specific test case.
- `arr` is a list created from the input, sorted in descending order, and appended with a 0. This list is unique to each test case.
- `dp` is a boolean variable that is initially set to `True` and is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. The final value of `dp` for each test case determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `dp` are redefined in each iteration, so their final values after the loop are not meaningful outside the context of the last test case.
