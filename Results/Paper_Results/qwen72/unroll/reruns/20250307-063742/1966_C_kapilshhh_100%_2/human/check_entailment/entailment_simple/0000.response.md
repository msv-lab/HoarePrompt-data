### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of piles (`n`) and the initial number of stones in each pile (`arr`).

2. **Unique and Sorted Piles**: The program converts the list of pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order. This is a crucial step because the game's outcome depends on the unique pile sizes and their differences. By sorting in descending order and adding a `0` at the end, the program ensures that it can handle the differences between consecutive pile sizes correctly.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Variable**: The variable `dp` is used to keep track of whether the current player (Alice or Bob) has a winning strategy. It starts as `True` (indicating Alice's turn).

4. **Loop Through Piles**: The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes (excluding the last `0` added for convenience). For each pile, it checks if the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size is greater than 1. If it is, the current player (Alice or Bob) has a winning move. If not, the turn is passed to the other player by toggling `dp`.

5. **Output**: After processing all the piles in a test case, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` (indicating Alice has a winning strategy) and "Bob" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Winning Condition**: The game is won by the player who can force the other player into a position where they cannot make a valid move. This happens when the smallest nonempty pile has a size of 1, and the other player is forced to remove 1 stone from all nonempty piles, leaving the current player with a winning move.

- **Unique Pile Sizes**: By considering only unique pile sizes, the program effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between consecutive pile sizes determine the outcome. This is correct because the game's dynamics are driven by the smallest pile size and the differences between pile sizes.

- **Difference Check**: The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` checks if the current player can remove more than one stone from each nonempty pile, which is a winning move. If this condition is met, the current player can always win by removing the appropriate number of stones.

- **Toggle Mechanism**: The `dp` variable toggles based on whether the current player has a winning move. This is a correct way to simulate the alternating turns in the game.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles the input and output as expected, and the logic for determining the winner is sound.

### Correctness:
