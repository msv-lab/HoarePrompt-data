#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list containing all the integers that are connected to the key by an edge in the `edges` list. The lists are not necessarily sorted. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the `edges` list and identifies the leaf nodes. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaf nodes. If the distance to either of these leaf nodes is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all the nodes that were reachable from `start` in the tree, and the loop returns the shortest distance (in terms of the number of edges) from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, the loop does not return a distance and the `queue` is empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers within the range of 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the distance (number of edges) between them. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns -1. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all nodes that were reachable from the `start` node, and the `queue` is empty.
