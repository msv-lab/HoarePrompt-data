The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers within the range of 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the distance (number of edges) between them. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns -1. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all nodes that were reachable from the `start` node, and the `queue` is empty.
