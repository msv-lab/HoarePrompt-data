The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers, and they must satisfy the constraints 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The function returns -1 if the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node in the tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers within the range of 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It returns -1 if the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node.**
