Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list containing all the integers that are connected to the key by an edge in the `edges` list. The lists are not necessarily sorted. `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the `tree`. `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves` as computed by the `bfs` function. `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves` as computed by the `bfs` function. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
