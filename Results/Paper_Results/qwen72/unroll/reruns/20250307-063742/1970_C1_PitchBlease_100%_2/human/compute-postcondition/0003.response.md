Output State: **The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all the nodes that were reachable from `start` in the tree, and the loop returns the shortest distance (in terms of the number of edges) from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, the loop does not return a distance and the `queue` is empty.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the `queue` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The `visited` set will contain all the nodes that were reachable from the starting node `start` in the tree. If the `target` node was found, the loop will return the shortest distance (number of edges) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node was not found, the loop will not return a distance, and the `queue` will be empty.
