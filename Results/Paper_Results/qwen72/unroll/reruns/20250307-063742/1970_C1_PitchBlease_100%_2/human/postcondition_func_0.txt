The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the `edges` list and identifies the leaf nodes. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaf nodes. If the distance to either of these leaf nodes is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
