### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction:**
   - The program correctly parses the input and constructs the tree using a `defaultdict` of lists. This ensures that each node points to its neighbors.
   - The `edges` list is used to populate the `tree` dictionary, which is a valid representation of the tree.

2. **Identifying Leaves:**
   - The program identifies the leaves of the tree by finding nodes with only one neighbor. Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, this step is correct.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - The `bfs` function is used to calculate the shortest distance from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
   - The BFS implementation is correct: it uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, and a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
   - The function returns the distance to the target node if it is reachable, and -1 otherwise. However, in the context of this problem, the target node (a leaf) is always reachable, so the function will always return a valid distance.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks the distances from the starting node to both leaves.
   - If either distance is odd, Ron wins because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make the last move on an even distance.
   - If both distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that she makes the last move.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs either "Ron" or "Hermione" based on the distances calculated, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
