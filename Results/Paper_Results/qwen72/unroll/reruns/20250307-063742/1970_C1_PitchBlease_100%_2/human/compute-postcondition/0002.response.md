The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` contains at least one element, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start` <= n and 1 <= `target` <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
