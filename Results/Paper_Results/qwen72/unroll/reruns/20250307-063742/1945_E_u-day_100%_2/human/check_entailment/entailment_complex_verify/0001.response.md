### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`, which is correct for a 0-indexed list. The problem description suggests `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, but this is for a 1-indexed array. Since the program uses a 0-indexed list, the initialization is appropriate.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct. This ensures that the loop continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent, which is the correct termination condition for binary search.
   - The mid-point calculation `mid = (low + high) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions for `low` and `high` are correct based on the comparison with `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x` after the binary search, the program prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the element `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be. The indices are adjusted by adding 1 to convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed, which is consistent with the problem's output format.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program is wrapped in a loop to handle multiple test cases:
     ```python
     for _ in range(int(input())):
         func_3()
     ```
   - This loop reads the number of test cases and calls `func_3` for each test case, which is the correct approach to handle multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identified that the program's binary search initialization and loop conditions are appropriate for a 0-indexed list.
- The swap logic is also correct and ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position.
- The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program does not handle multiple test cases. The annotated code clearly shows that the program does handle multiple test cases using a loop.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect due to not handling multiple test cases is inaccurate.

### Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
