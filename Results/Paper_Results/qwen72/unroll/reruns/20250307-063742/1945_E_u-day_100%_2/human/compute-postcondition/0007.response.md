Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes `st` as an empty set, and the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
