Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is appropriate for reading the values of `n` and `x` for each test case. The function is correct in its purpose and execution.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is suitable for reading the permutation `p`. The function is correct in its purpose and execution.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is the core of the program and is responsible for solving the problem. Let's break down its logic:

   - **Initialization**: It initializes `n` and `k` with the values returned from `func_1()`, and `arr` with the list returned from `func_2()`. It also initializes `pos` to -1, which will store the index of `k` in `arr` if found.
   
   - **Finding the Position of `k`**: It iterates through the list `arr` to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`. This is necessary to determine if `k` is in the permutation and to know its position for potential swaps.
   
   - **Binary Search Setup**: It sets `low` to 0 and `high` to `n` (the length of the permutation). This is a standard setup for binary search.
   
   - **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a correct termination condition for binary search. Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the value of `arr[mid]` compared to `k`. This is a standard binary search implementation.
   
   - **Output**:
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating a single swap is needed to place `k` at the correct position for binary search.

   - **Swapping Logic**: The program assumes that if `k` is not found at `arr[low]` after the binary search, a single swap between `low` and `pos` will place `k` in the correct position. This is based on the problem's guarantee that 2 operations are always sufficient. However, the program only prints a single swap, which is not always correct. For some cases, it might need to perform a second swap to ensure the permutation is correctly rearranged for binary search.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only prints a single swap, even though the problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed. This means the program might not always produce a correct solution for all test cases, especially when more than one swap is required to place `k` in the correct position for binary search.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle all cases where more than one swap is needed.

Correctness: **False**
