To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function, so it will start at 0. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `pos` is -1**
