Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `arr[low] == k`, otherwise `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.***
