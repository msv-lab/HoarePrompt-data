The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(0)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
   - `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `arr[low] == k`.
   - `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

### Explanation:
- The initial state provides detailed information about the variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and prints the integer `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
