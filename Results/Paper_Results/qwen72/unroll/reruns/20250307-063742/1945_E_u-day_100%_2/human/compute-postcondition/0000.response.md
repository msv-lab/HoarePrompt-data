Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`. `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `pos` is an integer that will store the index of `k` in `arr` if found.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The other variables, `arr` and `pos`, remain unchanged and retain their initial descriptions.
