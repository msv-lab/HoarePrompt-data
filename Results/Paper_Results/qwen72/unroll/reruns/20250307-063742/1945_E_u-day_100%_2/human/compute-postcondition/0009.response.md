Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, otherwise it is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These values remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`arr`**: The array `arr` is not modified by the loop.
- **`pos`**: If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos` will remain -1.
- **`low`**: After the loop, `low` will be the highest index in `arr` such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`high`**: After the loop, `high` will be the lowest index in `arr` such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- **`st`**: This set will contain all the indices that were checked during the binary search process, specifically the midpoints calculated in each iteration of the loop.
