Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, otherwise it is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
   - `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
   - `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. This means `arr[low]` is the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it is -1.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, which implies that `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `low + 1` will be the index immediately after the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `pos + 1` will be the index immediately after the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it will be 0 (since -1 + 1 = 0).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will output the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise -1)**
