Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `pos` is -1.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is set to -1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` remains a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The variable `pos` is now initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of `k` in `arr` if found.
