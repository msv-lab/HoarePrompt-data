Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always work correctly for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the binary search does not converge to the correct position of `x` even after one swap. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 3
5 1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
1 3
```
However, the program outputs:
```
1
2 2
```
This is incorrect because the binary search does not converge to the correct position of `3` after just one swap. The program only checks and swaps once, which is insufficient to ensure that the binary search will always find the correct position of `x` in the permutation. According to the problem description, up to two swaps are allowed to ensure the binary search works correctly.
