Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the number of test cases and the parameters `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - `func_2` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - `func_3` first finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr`. This is done using a simple loop, and the position is stored in `pos`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The function then performs a binary search to find the highest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the lowest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - The binary search is performed with `low` initialized to 0 and `high` initialized to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it means the binary search has found `k` at the correct position, and the function prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, the function prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating that one swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position.

5. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function only prints the swap if `arr[low] != k`. This ensures that the permutation is modified in such a way that `k` is in the correct position for the binary search to succeed.
   - The function does not perform more than one swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == k`).
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.

7. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_3` for each test case, which processes the input and outputs the required swaps.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly handle the task of finding `k` in the permutation and ensuring that the binary search can find `k` by performing at most one swap. The logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
