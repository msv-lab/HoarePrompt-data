### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`. This is correct for a 0-indexed list, which is consistent with Python's indexing. The problem description suggests `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, but this is for a 1-indexed array. The program's approach is valid and does not introduce any errors.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct and ensures that the search continues until the range is narrowed down to a single element.
   - The mid-point calculation `mid = (low + high) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions for `low` and `high` are correct based on the comparison with `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x` after the binary search, the program prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the element `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be. The indices are adjusted by adding 1 to convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does indeed handle multiple test cases. The outer loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` processes each test case by calling `func_3()` for each test case. This is a correct implementation for handling multiple test cases.

5. **Function Calls and Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` and `func_2()` are used to read the input for each test case. `func_1()` reads the integers `n` and `x`, and `func_2()` reads the permutation `arr`.
   - These functions are correctly used to parse the input and are consistent with the problem's input format.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the logic for finding the position of `x` in the permutation and performing the necessary swap to ensure the binary search works correctly.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using an outer loop.
- The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program does not handle multiple test cases, which is not true.

Final: **True**
