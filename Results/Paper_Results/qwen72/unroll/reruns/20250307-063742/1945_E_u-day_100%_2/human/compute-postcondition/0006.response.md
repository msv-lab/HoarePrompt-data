Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are unchanged, and the array `arr` is also unchanged. The variable `pos` retains its value as the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, or remains -1 if `k` is not found. The variables `low` and `high` are now set to 0 and `n` respectively.
