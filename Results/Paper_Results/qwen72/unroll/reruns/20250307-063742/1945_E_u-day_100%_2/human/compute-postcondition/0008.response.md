The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `low` and `high` need to be adjusted such that the condition `low + 1 < high` is true.

Right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

For the loop to execute the first time, `low + 1` must be less than `high`. Given that `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1. Since `high` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set**
