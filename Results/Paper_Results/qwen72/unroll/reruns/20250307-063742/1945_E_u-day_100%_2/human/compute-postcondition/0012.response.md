Postcondition: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, otherwise it is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
