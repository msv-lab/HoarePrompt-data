You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It retrieves `n` and `k` from `func_1`, and `arr` from `func_2`. It then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` (a permutation of integers of length `n`). If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the highest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the lowest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. It prints 0 if `k` is found at `arr[low]`, and 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `k` is not found at `arr[low]`. The final state of the program is that `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise -1, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the binary search loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
- We then perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
- The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - It is used to read the test case parameters and the permutation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It is used to read the permutation.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to find.
   - It reads the permutation `arr`.
   - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - It performs the binary search, adding the mid-point to a set `st` to track the positions checked.
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x` after the binary search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`.
   - However, the problem description suggests `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - This discrepancy might cause issues, but since the binary search is performed on a 0-indexed list, it should still work correctly.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct.
   - The mid-point calculation `mid = (low + high) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions for `low` and `high` are correct based on the comparison with `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x` after the binary search, the program prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the element `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases explicitly. It should be wrapped in a loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation.
- It correctly performs the binary search and determines if a swap is needed.
- The swap logic is correct and ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position for the binary search to succeed.

However, the program does not handle multiple test cases, which is a requirement of the problem. This is a significant oversight.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct in terms of the logic for a single test case, but it fails to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
