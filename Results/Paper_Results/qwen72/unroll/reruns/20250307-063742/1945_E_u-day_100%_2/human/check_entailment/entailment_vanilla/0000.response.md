Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
- We then perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
- The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - It is used to read the test case parameters and the permutation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It is used to read the permutation.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to find.
   - It reads the permutation `arr`.
   - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - It performs the binary search, adding the mid-point to a set `st` to track the positions checked.
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x` after the binary search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`.
   - However, the problem description suggests `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - This discrepancy might cause issues, but since the binary search is performed on a 0-indexed list, it should still work correctly.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct.
   - The mid-point calculation `mid = (low + high) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions for `low` and `high` are correct based on the comparison with `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x` after the binary search, the program prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the element `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases explicitly. It should be wrapped in a loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation.
- It correctly performs the binary search and determines if a swap is needed.
- The swap logic is correct and ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position for the binary search to succeed.

However, the program does not handle multiple test cases, which is a requirement of the problem. This is a significant oversight.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct in terms of the logic for a single test case, but it fails to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
