The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It retrieves `n` and `k` from `func_1`, and `arr` from `func_2`. It then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` (a permutation of integers of length `n`). If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the highest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the lowest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. It prints 0 if `k` is found at `arr[low]`, and 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `k` is not found at `arr[low]`. The final state of the program is that `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise -1, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the binary search loop.
