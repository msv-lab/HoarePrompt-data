Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts the input string, split by spaces, into a sequence of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, and returns an iterator that converts each split substring into an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an iterator over the sequence of integers derived from the input string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, the specific contents of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by calling the function `func_1()`. The specific contents of the list depend on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and pos is an integer that will store the index of k in arr if found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, otherwise it is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise -1)
    #State: *`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `arr[low] == k`, otherwise `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It retrieves `n` and `k` from `func_1`, and `arr` from `func_2`. It then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` (a permutation of integers of length `n`). If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the highest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the lowest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. It prints 0 if `k` is found at `arr[low]`, and 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `k` is not found at `arr[low]`. The final state of the program is that `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise -1, `low` is the highest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the lowest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the binary search loop.
