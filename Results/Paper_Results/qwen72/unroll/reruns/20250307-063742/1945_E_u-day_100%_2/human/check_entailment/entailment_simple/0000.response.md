Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read input. `func_1` reads the first line of each test case (n and k), and `func_2` reads the second line (the permutation array).
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - The program iterates through the array `arr` to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`.
   - This is a correct approach to find the position of `k` in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a common termination condition for binary search.
   - Inside the loop, the program calculates `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`.
   - The set `st` is used to store the indices checked during the binary search, but it is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, the program prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap that should place `k` at the correct position for the binary search to succeed.

5. **Correctness of the Swap**:
   - The program assumes that `pos` is the correct index of `k` in the permutation.
   - The swap is performed between `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to place `k` at the position where the binary search would find it.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation. If `pos` remains `-1`, the swap will be invalid.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a critical flaw: it does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation. If `k` is not in the permutation, `pos` will remain `-1`, and the swap will be invalid, leading to incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
