Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid and Robot Movement**:
   - The grid has 2 rows and `n` columns.
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot must move every second, and it can't skip a move.
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it can't move outside the grid.
   - After the robot moves, it follows the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`. If it is not, the program immediately prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is based on the idea that to reach the last cell (2, n), the robot must be able to move from (2, n-1) to (2, n). If the arrow in (2, n-1) is not pointing to the right, the robot cannot reach (2, n).

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If it is, the program prints 'YES'.
   - This is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is always at least 2, and the robot cannot move to (2, 1) from (1, 1) in one step.

4. **Path Checking**:
   - The program initializes a variable `no_path` to `True`.
   - It checks every even-indexed cell in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it means all even-indexed cells in the second row are pointing to the right.
   - The program then resets `no_path` to `True` and checks every odd-indexed cell in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n-1, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for `n == 1`, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. This check should be removed.

2. **Path Checking Logic**:
   - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The program assumes that if all even-indexed cells in the second row and all odd-indexed cells in the first row are pointing to the right, the robot can reach (2, n). However, this is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. The current logic does not account for the robot's movement through the grid and the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Correct Approach:
- The robot can reach (2, n) if there is a way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. This requires a more detailed simulation of the robot's movement.
- The robot can move down from the first row to the second row at any column, and it can move up from the second row to the first row at any column.
- The robot must be able to move to the right in the second row to reach (2, n).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and relies on an incorrect assumption about the path.

Correctness: **False**
