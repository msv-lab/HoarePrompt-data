You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints 'YES' if the conditions for the arrows are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated according to the input for each test case, but their values are not retained between iterations. After all iterations, the loop completes and the program ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the following conditions are met: the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and there is no path from the first row to the second row of a grid represented by `a` and `b` that avoids all '>' characters. If these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their values are not retained between iterations. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the robot can reach the cell (2, n) correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if there is a path to (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can reach (2, 4) as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (since the arrow at (1, 1) points right)
3. Move right to (1, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 2) points right)
4. Move down to (2, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 3) points left, and the robot must move down)
5. Move right to (2, 4) (since the arrow at (2, 3) points right)

The program incorrectly prints "NO" for this input. The issue lies in the logic that checks for the presence of '>' in the second row and the first row, which does not accurately determine if a path exists to (2, n).
