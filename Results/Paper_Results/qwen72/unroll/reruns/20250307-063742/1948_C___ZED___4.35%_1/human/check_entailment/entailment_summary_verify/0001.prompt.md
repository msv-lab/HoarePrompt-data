You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the following conditions are met: the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and there is no path from the first row to the second row of a grid represented by `a` and `b` that avoids all '>' characters. If these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their values are not retained between iterations. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid and Robot Movement**:
   - The grid has 2 rows and `n` columns.
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot must move every second, and it can't skip a move.
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it can't move outside the grid.
   - After the robot moves, it follows the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`. If it is not, the program immediately prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is based on the idea that to reach the last cell (2, n), the robot must be able to move from (2, n-1) to (2, n). If the arrow in (2, n-1) is not pointing to the right, the robot cannot reach (2, n).

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If it is, the program prints 'YES'.
   - This is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is always at least 2, and the robot cannot move to (2, 1) from (1, 1) in one step.

4. **Path Checking**:
   - The program initializes a variable `no_path` to `True`.
   - It checks every even-indexed cell in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it means all even-indexed cells in the second row are pointing to the right.
   - The program then resets `no_path` to `True` and checks every odd-indexed cell in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n-1, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for `n == 1`, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. This check should be removed.

2. **Path Checking Logic**:
   - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The program assumes that if all even-indexed cells in the second row and all odd-indexed cells in the first row are pointing to the right, the robot can reach (2, n). However, this is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. The current logic does not account for the robot's movement through the grid and the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Correct Approach:
- The robot can reach (2, n) if there is a way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. This requires a more detailed simulation of the robot's movement.
- The robot can move down from the first row to the second row at any column, and it can move up from the second row to the first row at any column.
- The robot must be able to move to the right in the second row to reach (2, n).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and relies on an incorrect assumption about the path.
