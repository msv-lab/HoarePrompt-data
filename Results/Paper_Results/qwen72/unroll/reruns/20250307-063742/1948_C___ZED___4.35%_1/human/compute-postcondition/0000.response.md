The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5
- The second and third lines of each test case are strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively

We need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
