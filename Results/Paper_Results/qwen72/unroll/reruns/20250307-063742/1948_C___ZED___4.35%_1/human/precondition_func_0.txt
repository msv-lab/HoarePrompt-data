t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; the second and third lines of each test case are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
