### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2]`**:
   - The program first checks if the second-to-last character of the string `b` (which represents the second row of the grid) is not '>'. If this condition is true, it immediately prints 'NO' because the robot cannot reach the last cell (2, n) if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left. This is a valid check because the robot must be able to move to the last cell in the second row.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program then checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and can be removed. It does not affect the correctness of the program because `n` will never be 1.

3. **Checking for Path Existence**:
   - The program then checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row that avoids all '>' characters. It does this by iterating over the even-indexed positions in `b` and checking if any of them are not '>'. If any of them are not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it performs a similar check on the odd-indexed positions in `a`. If any of these positions are not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- The special case for `n == 1` is unnecessary and can be removed.
- The logic for checking the path existence is flawed. The program should check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then from the second row to the last cell (2, n). The current logic does not correctly handle this.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It must be able to move to the second row at some point.
- Once in the second row, it must be able to move to the last cell (2, n).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row
            can_move_to_second_row = False
            for k in range(n):
                if a[k] == '>':
                    can_move_to_second_row = True
                    break
            if can_move_to_second_row:
                # Check if the robot can move from the second row to the last cell
                can_move_to_last_cell = False
                for k in range(n-2, -1, -1):
                    if b[k] == '>':
                        can_move_to_last_cell = True
                        break
                if can_move_to_last_cell:
                    print('YES')
                else:
                    print('NO')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the path existence logic. The robot must be able to move from the first row to the second row and then from the second row to the last cell. The original program does not check this correctly.

Correctness: **False**
