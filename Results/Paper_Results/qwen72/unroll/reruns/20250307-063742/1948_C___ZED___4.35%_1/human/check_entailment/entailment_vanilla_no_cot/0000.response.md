Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the First Row's Arrow Direction**:
   - The program checks if `b[-2] != '>'` and immediately prints `NO` if this condition is true. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. The robot can still reach `(2, n)` even if `b[-2]` is not `>`, as long as there is a valid path that allows the robot to move to the last column of the second row.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Paths**:
   - The program checks if there is a `>` in every second cell of the second row (`b[k]` for even `k`). If it finds a cell that is not `>`, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is flawed because the robot can move to the second row from the first row at any point, not just at even-indexed cells.
   - Similarly, the program checks if there is a `>` in every second cell of the first row (`a[k]` for odd `k`). This is also incorrect because the robot can move to the first row from the second row at any point, not just at odd-indexed cells.

3. **Incorrect Final Path Check**:
   - The program incorrectly prints `YES` if `no_path` is still `True` after the second loop. This means it prints `YES` if there are no `>` arrows in the odd-indexed cells of the first row, which is not a valid condition for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`, you should:
- Check if the robot can move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)` by considering all possible moves and the direction of the arrows.
- The robot can move to the second row at any point, and it can move to the last column of the second row if there is a valid path that allows it to do so.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # The robot can reach (2, n) if it can move to the second row and then to the last column
        # Check if the robot can move to the second row at any point
        can_move_to_second_row = False
        for k in range(n):
            if a[k] == '<' and b[k] == '>':
                can_move_to_second_row = True
                break
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the last column of the second row
        can_move_to_last_column = True
        for k in range(n-1):
            if b[k] == '<':
                can_move_to_last_column = False
                break
        
        if can_move_to_second_row and can_move_to_last_column:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_move_to_second_row`**: This flag is set to `True` if the robot can move from the first row to the second row at any point. The robot can move to the second row if it encounters a cell in the first row pointing left (`<`) and the corresponding cell in the second row pointing right (`>`).
- **`can_move_to_last_column`**: This flag is set to `True` if the robot can move from any cell in the second row to the last column of the second row. The robot can move to the last column if there are no left-pointing arrows (`<`) in the second row before the last column.
- The robot can reach `(2, n)` if both conditions are met. Otherwise, it cannot reach the target cell, and the program prints `NO`.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
