The function `func` is described with specific constraints but does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. Based on the constraints and the expected output, the function likely accepts parameters related to a test case, including an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing characters '<' and/or '>'. It processes each test case and returns a result for each, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given constraints.**
