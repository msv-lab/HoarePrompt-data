Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the robot can reach the cell (2, n) correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if there is a path to (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can reach (2, 4) as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (since the arrow at (1, 1) points right)
3. Move right to (1, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 2) points right)
4. Move down to (2, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 3) points left, and the robot must move down)
5. Move right to (2, 4) (since the arrow at (2, 3) points right)

The program incorrectly prints "NO" for this input. The issue lies in the logic that checks for the presence of '>' in the second row and the first row, which does not accurately determine if a path exists to (2, n).
