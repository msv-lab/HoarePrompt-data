Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints 'YES' if the conditions for the arrows are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated according to the input for each test case, but their values are not retained between iterations. After all iterations, the loop completes and the program ends.**
