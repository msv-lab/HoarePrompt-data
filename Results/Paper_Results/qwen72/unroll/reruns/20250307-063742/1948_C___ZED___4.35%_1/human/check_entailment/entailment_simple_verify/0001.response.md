### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). This is a valid check because if the robot is to reach the last cell (2, n), the arrow in cell (2, n-1) must point to the right. If `b[-2]` is not `>`, the robot cannot reach (2, n), and the program correctly prints 'NO'.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1 and prints 'YES' if it is. However, the problem constraints clearly state that `n` is always at least 2. This check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program. The original assessment correctly identifies this as an issue.

3. **Path Checking**:
   - The program initializes a variable `no_path` to `True` and checks every even-indexed cell in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - This check ensures that there is a path from the left side of the second row to the right side, but it does not account for the robot's initial position in the first row and the possibility of moving between rows.
   - The program then resets `no_path` to `True` and checks every odd-indexed cell in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n-1, 2)`) to see if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`. If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - This second check is intended to ensure that the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving to the right. However, the logic is flawed because it does not consider the robot's movement from the first row to the second row and back.

4. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program assumes that if all even-indexed cells in the second row and all odd-indexed cells in the first row are pointing to the right, the robot can reach (2, n). This is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. The current logic does not account for the robot's movement through the grid and the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Correct Approach:
- The robot can reach (2, n) if there is a way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. This requires a more detailed simulation of the robot's movement.
- The robot can move down from the first row to the second row at any column, and it can move up from the second row to the first row at any column.
- The robot must be able to move to the right in the second row to reach (2, n).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and relies on an incorrect assumption about the path. The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
