### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The function checks if the second-to-last character of the second row `b` is not '>'. If it is not, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row.

3. **Path Checking**:
   - The function then checks two conditions:
     - It checks if there is any cell in the second row `b` at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) that does not point to the right. If any such cell is found, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
     - It checks if there is any cell in the first row `a` at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) that does not point to the right. If any such cell is found, it sets `no_path` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case for `n == 1`**:
  - The condition `elif n == 1:` is incorrect because `n` is guaranteed to be even and at least 2. This condition will never be true and can be removed.

- **Path Checking Logic**:
  - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function should check if there is a way for the robot to move from the first row to the second row and then to the last cell in the second row. The current logic only checks if there are any '<' characters in specific positions, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot can reach the cell (2, n) if:
  - It can move from the first row to the second row at some point.
  - It can then move to the last cell in the second row without getting stuck.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        else:
            can_move_to_second_row = False
            for k in range(n):
                if a[k] == '>' and b[k] == '<':
                    can_move_to_second_row = True
                    break
            if can_move_to_second_row:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not properly check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then to the last cell in the second row.

Correctness: **False**
