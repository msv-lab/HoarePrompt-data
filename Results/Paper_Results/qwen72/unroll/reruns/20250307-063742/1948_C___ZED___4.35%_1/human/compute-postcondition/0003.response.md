Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the following conditions are met: the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and there is no path from the first row to the second row of a grid represented by `a` and `b` that avoids all '>' characters. If these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their values are not retained between iterations. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends. **
