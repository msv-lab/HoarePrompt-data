Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of the area is flawed. The program calculates the distance between two points (p1 and p2) and then multiplies the square roots of these distances, which does not necessarily give the correct area of the square.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```
The coordinates of the square are (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). The correct area of this square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program will calculate the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) as 4, and the distance between (3, 1) and (3, 3) as 4. It then calculates the area as `abs(math.sqrt(4) * math.sqrt(4))`, which is 4, but this is coincidentally correct due to the specific input. The program does not correctly handle the general case.

A correct approach would be to find the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two adjacent points and then squaring this distance to get the area.
