Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and `s` is printed. `n` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())` for each iteration of the loop.
- `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` and printed.
- After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.
- The function `func` and the initial state regarding the test cases and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged and are not affected by the provided code snippet.
