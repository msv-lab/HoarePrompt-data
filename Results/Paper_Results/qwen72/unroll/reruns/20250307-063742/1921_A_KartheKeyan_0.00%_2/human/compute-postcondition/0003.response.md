Output State: **`n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged, and `s` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `l` and `s` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The loop only processes the coordinates and calculates the result `res` for each iteration, but does not alter the values of `l` or `s`.
