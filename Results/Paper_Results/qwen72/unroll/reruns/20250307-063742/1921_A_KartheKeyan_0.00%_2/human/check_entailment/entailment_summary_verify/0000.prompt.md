You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the input, representing the corners of a square. The function calculates the area of the square by determining the lengths of two adjacent sides and then prints the area. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of the area is flawed. The program calculates the distance between two points (p1 and p2) and then multiplies the square roots of these distances, which does not necessarily give the correct area of the square.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```
The coordinates of the square are (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). The correct area of this square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program will calculate the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) as 4, and the distance between (3, 1) and (3, 3) as 4. It then calculates the area as `abs(math.sqrt(4) * math.sqrt(4))`, which is 4, but this is coincidentally correct due to the specific input. The program does not correctly handle the general case.

A correct approach would be to find the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two adjacent points and then squaring this distance to get the area.
