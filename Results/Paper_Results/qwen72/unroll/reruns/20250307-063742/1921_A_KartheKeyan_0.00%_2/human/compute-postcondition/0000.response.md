Output State: **The function `func` should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. `n` is an input integer, and the loop will execute `n` times. For each iteration, `l` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and `s` is printed. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.**
