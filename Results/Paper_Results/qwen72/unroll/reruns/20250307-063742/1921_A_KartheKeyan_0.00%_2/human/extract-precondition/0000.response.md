Precondition: **The function `func` should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the test cases as input. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition is:

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**
