Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the input, representing the corners of a square. The function calculates the area of the square by determining the lengths of two adjacent sides and then prints the area. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0. The function does not return any value. **
