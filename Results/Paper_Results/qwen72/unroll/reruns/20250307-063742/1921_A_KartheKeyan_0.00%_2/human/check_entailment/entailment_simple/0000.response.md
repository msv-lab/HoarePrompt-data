Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. This matches the problem description.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The program sorts the coordinates. Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a consistent order, which is useful for calculating the side length of the square. However, the sorting method used here may not be the most straightforward for this problem, as it sorts the points lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate). This can lead to issues if the points are not aligned in a way that the first two points and the last two points are on the same sides of the square.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`). These distances should be equal to the side length of the square squared. However, the program then calculates the area by taking the square root of each distance, multiplying them, and taking the absolute value. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the side length of the square is the same for both calculations, and the area should simply be the square of this side length.

4. **Area Calculation**: The correct way to calculate the area of the square is to find the side length (which can be derived from the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points) and then square it. The program's approach of taking the square root of the squared distances and then multiplying them is redundant and can introduce floating-point precision issues.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is required by the problem description.

Given the issues with the sorting and the unnecessary and incorrect calculation of the area, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
