The function `max_triangular_pieces` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n`: an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
- `x`: an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)).
- `y`: an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x).
- `chosen_vertices`: a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, given the constraints of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. It returns the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, given the constraints of the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of chosen vertices.**
