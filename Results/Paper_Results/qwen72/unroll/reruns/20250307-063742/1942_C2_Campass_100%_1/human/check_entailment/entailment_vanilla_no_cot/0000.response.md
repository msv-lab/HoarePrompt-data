Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of triangular pieces of cake by summing up the values in `val` and adjusting `y` accordingly. However, the logic for determining how many additional vertices to choose and how to form the maximum number of triangles is flawed.
   - Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the formation of non-intersecting diagonals and the counting of triangles.

2. **Handling of Diagonals and Triangles:**
   - The problem requires forming non-intersecting diagonals to maximize the number of triangular pieces. The program does not ensure that the diagonals do not intersect.
   - The logic for choosing additional vertices and forming triangles is not clear and does not follow a well-defined algorithm for this problem.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `y` is 0 or when the vertices chosen by Bessie are already optimal.

4. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - The correct approach to this problem involves a more sophisticated algorithm for forming non-intersecting diagonals and counting the resulting triangles. The provided program does not implement such an algorithm.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify the gaps between the chosen vertices.
- Determine how to optimally choose additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles.
- Ensure that the chosen vertices and additional vertices form non-intersecting diagonals.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed and structured approach to handle these aspects, which the provided program does not implement.
