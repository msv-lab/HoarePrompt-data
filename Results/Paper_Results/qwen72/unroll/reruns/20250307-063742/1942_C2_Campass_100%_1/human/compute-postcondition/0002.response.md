The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `t` is now assigned the value of the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.**
