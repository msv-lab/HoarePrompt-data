You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, x, y = R()
        
        sx = 0
        
        l = list(R())
        
        l.sort()
        
        l.append(n + l[0])
        
        val = []
        
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        
        cons = x + sx - 2
        
        print(cons)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are reset and updated for each iteration, and their final values depend on the last test case processed. The variable `cons` is printed for each test case, and its value is the number of vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. It returns the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, given the constraints of the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of chosen vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
