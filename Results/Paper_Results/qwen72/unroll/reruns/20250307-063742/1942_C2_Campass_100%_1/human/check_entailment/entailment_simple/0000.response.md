### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. It should be defined as `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` to properly handle the inputs.
   - The function uses a lambda function `R` to read input, which is not a standard practice and can be confusing. However, it does correctly read the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The function correctly processes each test case using a while loop that decrements `t` until it reaches 0.
   - Inside the loop, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `l`.

3. **Sorting and Appending**:
   - The chosen vertices `l` are sorted, which is necessary to handle the vertices in a consistent order.
   - The function appends `n + l[0]` to the list `l` to handle the circular nature of the polygon. This is a good approach to ensure that the vertices are treated as a circular sequence.

4. **Calculating Gaps**:
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in the list `val`. This is done by iterating through the sorted list and computing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for each pair of consecutive vertices.
   - The gaps are then sorted based on a custom key that prioritizes even gaps over odd gaps. This is a reasonable approach to maximize the number of triangles by filling in the largest gaps first.

5. **Filling Gaps**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted gaps and attempts to fill them using the available vertices `y`.
   - It calculates the number of vertices needed to fill each gap (`c = i // 2`) and updates the total number of vertices used (`sx`) and the remaining vertices (`y`).
   - If the remaining vertices `y` are insufficient to fill a gap, it adds the maximum possible number of vertices to `sx` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Calculating the Number of Triangles**:
   - The function calculates the number of triangular pieces of cake using the formula `cons = x + sx - 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that each additional vertex added to the chosen vertices can form one or more triangles, and the initial number of chosen vertices `x` can form `x - 2` triangles.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of triangular pieces for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:

Despite the issues with the function definition and input handling, the core logic of the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. The gaps are calculated and filled appropriately, and the number of triangular pieces is computed correctly.

However, the function definition and input handling should be corrected to match the problem description more closely.

### Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description. The only improvements needed are in the function definition and input handling.
