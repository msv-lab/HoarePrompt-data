You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are reset and updated for each iteration, and their final values depend on the last test case processed. The variable `cons` is printed for each test case, and its value is the number of vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of additional vertices to choose and the number of triangles that can be formed from those vertices is not entirely correct.

### Issue:
1. **Calculation of `c` and `sx`**:
   - The program calculates `c` as `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, which represents the number of vertices between two chosen vertices.
   - It then appends `c` to the `val` list and sorts it based on a custom key. This key is designed to prioritize even numbers over odd numbers, but it is not clear why this is necessary or how it contributes to the correct solution.
   - The program then iterates over `val` and tries to add the maximum number of vertices `y` to form triangles. However, the logic for adding these vertices and calculating the number of triangles is flawed.

### Test Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
1 3
```
- **n = 5**: The cake is a pentagon.
- **x = 2**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3.
- **y = 2**: You can choose up to 2 additional vertices.

**Expected Output**:
- The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out is 3. This can be achieved by choosing vertices 2 and 4, and forming triangles (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), and (1, 4, 5).

**Actual Output**:
- The program will output 2, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Test Case:
- The vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3.
- The vertices between 1 and 3 are 2.
- The vertices between 3 and 1 (considering the polygon is cyclic) are 4 and 5.
- By choosing vertices 2 and 4, we can form 3 non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), and (1, 4, 5).

However, the program does not correctly handle this case and outputs 2 instead of 3. This indicates that the logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed, and the program is incorrect.
