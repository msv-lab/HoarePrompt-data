Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are reset and updated for each iteration, and their final values depend on the last test case processed. The variable `cons` is printed for each test case, and its value is the number of vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- Inside the loop, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are updated based on the input for each test case.
- `l` is a sorted list of the chosen vertices, with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
- `val` is a list of the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
- The loop then processes these gaps to determine the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen, updating `sx` and `y` accordingly.
- Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and printed for each test case.
- After the loop finishes, `t` is 0, and the other variables are in their final state based on the last test case.
