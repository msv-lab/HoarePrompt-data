### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of vertices Bessie has chosen and sorts them.

2. **Vertex and Gap Calculation:**
   - The function appends `n + l[0]` to the list of chosen vertices to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
   - It calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in the list `val`.

3. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on a custom key: `(1 - x & 1, x)`. This key ensures that gaps are sorted by their parity (even first, then odd) and then by their size.

4. **Maximizing Triangular Pieces:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to add as many vertices as possible to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of vertices that can be added (`c = i // 2`).
   - If the number of remaining vertices `y` is less than `c`, it adds the maximum possible vertices and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds the vertices and updates `y`.

5. **Final Calculation and Output:**
   - The function calculates the total number of vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces (`cons = x + sx - 2`).
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:** The function definition `def func():` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`.
- **Input Handling:** The function uses `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` to read input, which is not a standard way to handle input in a function. It should be passed as arguments.
- **Variable Scope:** The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are reset and updated for each test case, which is correct, but the function should be designed to handle these variables as arguments.
- **Output:** The function prints the result for each test case, which is correct, but it should be designed to return the results if needed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the function definition and input handling, the program is not correct as it stands. However, if we assume that the function is called correctly with the appropriate arguments and input handling is done outside the function, the logic inside the function appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function `func` is not correctly defined and does not handle input in a standard way, which makes it incorrect in the context of the problem description.
