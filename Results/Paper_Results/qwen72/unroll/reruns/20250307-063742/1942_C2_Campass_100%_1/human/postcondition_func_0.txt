The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces that can be formed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final value of `t` is 0, and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, and `val` are reset and updated for each iteration.
