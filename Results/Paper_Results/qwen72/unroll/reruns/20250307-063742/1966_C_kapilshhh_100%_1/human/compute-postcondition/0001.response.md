The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 for each test case, and a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile in the game. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `tc` must be greater than 0**
