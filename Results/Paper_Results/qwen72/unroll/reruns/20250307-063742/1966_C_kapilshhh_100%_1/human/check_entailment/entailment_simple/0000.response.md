### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Pile Size Processing:**
   - The program converts the input list of pile sizes into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts it in descending order and appends a 0 at the end. This ensures that the array `arr` is processed in a way that the differences between consecutive elements can be easily calculated.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) State:**
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, which represents Alice's turn.
   - The program iterates through the sorted and unique pile sizes, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If so, it toggles the `dp` state. This is based on the idea that if the difference between the sizes of two consecutive piles is greater than 1, the player whose turn it is can force the other player into a losing position by removing a specific number of stones.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - After processing all the piles, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`. This is the correct way to determine the winner based on the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there is only one pile correctly. If the pile size is 1, Alice will be forced to remove 1 stone, and Bob will win. If the pile size is greater than 1, Alice can remove a number of stones to force Bob into a losing position.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it sorts the unique pile sizes and processes them in linear time.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
