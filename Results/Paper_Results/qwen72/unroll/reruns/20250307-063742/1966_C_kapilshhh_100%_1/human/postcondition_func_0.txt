The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_i`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `a_i` values, sorts the unique values in descending order, and then determines whether the game state allows Alice to win or Bob to win based on a specific condition. The function prints 'Alice' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the value of `tc` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `a_i` are not modified by the function.
