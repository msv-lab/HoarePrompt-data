### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of initial stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Processing the Piles:**
   - The function converts the list of stones into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique values in descending order.
   - It appends a `0` to the end of the sorted list to handle the edge case where the smallest pile is considered.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization:**
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, which represents the state of the game where Alice can win if the condition is met.

4. **Game State Evaluation:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of unique pile sizes (excluding the appended `0`).
   - For each pile size `arr[i]`, it checks if the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size (`arr[i] - arr[i + 1]`) is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `dp` to `True`, indicating that Alice can win.
   - If the difference is not greater than 1, it sets `dp` to `not dp`, which toggles the state based on the previous value of `dp`.

5. **Output:**
   - After evaluating the game state, the function prints 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` and 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move.
- The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` checks if there is a significant gap between consecutive pile sizes. If such a gap exists, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
- The `dp` variable is used to track the parity of the number of moves that can be made. If the number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Pile:** If there is only one pile, the game is trivial. Alice wins if the pile size is greater than 1, and Bob wins if the pile size is 1.
- **Multiple Piles with the Same Size:** If all piles have the same size, Alice can win by removing all stones in one move.
- **Multiple Piles with Different Sizes:** The function correctly handles this by checking the gaps between consecutive pile sizes.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description and constraints. The use of `dp` to track the game state and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` ensures that the function accurately determines the winner for each test case.
