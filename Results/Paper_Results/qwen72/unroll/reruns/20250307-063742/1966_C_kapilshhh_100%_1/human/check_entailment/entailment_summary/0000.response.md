### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case by reading the number of piles (`n`) and the list of pile sizes (`arr`).

2. **Unique and Sorted Piles**: The function converts the list of pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique values in descending order. This is a crucial step because the game is played by removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile, and the smallest nonempty pile determines the maximum number of stones that can be removed in one turn. Sorting in descending order helps in efficiently checking the game state.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) State**: The function uses a boolean variable `dp` to keep track of the game state. The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, which represents Alice's turn. The loop iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates the `dp` state based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. This condition checks if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1. If it is, the current player (Alice or Bob) can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position. If the difference is 1 or less, the current player cannot force a win, and the state is flipped to the opponent's turn.

4. **Output**: The function prints 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` at the end of the loop, indicating that Alice can win the game. Otherwise, it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob can win the game.

5. **Test Case Processing**: The function correctly decrements `tc` after processing each test case and continues the loop until all test cases are processed.

### Analysis of the Condition:
- The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` checks if there is a significant gap between the sizes of consecutive piles. If such a gap exists, the current player can remove a number of stones that leaves the opponent in a position where they cannot win.
- The `or not dp` part ensures that if the gap is not significant, the state is flipped to the opponent's turn.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 3 3 3 3`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[3, 0]`
  - `dp` remains `True` because there is no significant gap.
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `1 7`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[7, 1, 0]`
  - `dp` is flipped to `False` because the gap between 7 and 1 is significant.
  - Output: `Bob` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[100, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `dp` is flipped multiple times but ends up `True` because the gaps are significant.
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `1 2 3`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `dp` remains `True` because the gaps are significant.
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `2 1 3 4 2 4`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `dp` is flipped to `False` because the gaps are significant.
  - Output: `Bob` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[9, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0]`
  - `dp` remains `True` because the gaps are significant.
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `1000000000`
  - Unique sorted piles: `[1000000000, 0]`
  - `dp` remains `True` because there is no significant gap.
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and the execution summary. The condition used in the loop is appropriate for the game's rules, and the function handles all test cases as expected.
