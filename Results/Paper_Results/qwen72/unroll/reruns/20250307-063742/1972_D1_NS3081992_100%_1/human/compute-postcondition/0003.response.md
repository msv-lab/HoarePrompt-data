The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It relies on external functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` to provide the number of test cases and the result for each test case, respectively. The function returns a list of results for each test case obtained from `func_15()`, where the number of test cases is determined by `func_10()`.
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of results for each test case, where the number of test cases is determined by an external function `func_10()`, and the results are obtained from another external function `func_15()`.**
