Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns the integer value read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value. The function assumes that the input is a valid integer and does not handle invalid input cases. After the function concludes, the integer value read from the standard input is returned, and no other changes are made to the program state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from standard input, expecting one or more space-separated integers, and returns an iterator that yields these integers as individual integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been processed and an iterator is available to iterate over the integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each resulting string to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of the resulting strings. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :

        #The program returns 1.
    #State: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), tmp is 1000000000, and the length of the list d[da] is not equal to 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged. The list `processing` may have some of its elements set to 1, specifically those elements at indices `di - 1` where `di` is an element of the list `d[da]` and `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The variable `da` remains unchanged. The variable `tmp` will be the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The list `rank` remains unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The list `rank` is updated such that `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being `0`). The function updates the `rank` list such that `rank[da - 1]` is set to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus one. The final return value is this minimum value plus one. The dictionary `d` and the integer `da` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a), where 'a' is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= n.
    #State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and b is not equal to 0.
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and `b` is not equal to 0. The first element of the tuple is `y`, the second element is `x` minus the integer division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `y`, and the third element is `g`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of recursively calling `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The function ultimately computes and returns a tuple of three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer where k has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer where k has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` up to index `n-1` where a[i] is less than `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the decrements, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a`, `n`, or `m`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `m + 1` or the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `m + 1` if that condition is met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) obtained from the function `func_7`. The function calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or up to `m` if that condition is not met. The final result is this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on external functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` to provide the number of test cases and the result for each test case, respectively.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, the result of `func_15()` has been written to the standard output followed by a newline character. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output contains the results of `func_15()` for each test case, each on a new line. Variables outside the function remain unchanged.
