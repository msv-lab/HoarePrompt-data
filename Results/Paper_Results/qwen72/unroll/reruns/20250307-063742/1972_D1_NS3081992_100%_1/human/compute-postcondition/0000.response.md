The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop head condition.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used**
