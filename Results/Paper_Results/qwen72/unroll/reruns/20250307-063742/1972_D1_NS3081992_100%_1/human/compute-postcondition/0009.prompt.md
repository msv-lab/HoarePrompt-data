You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), tmp is 1000000000, and the length of the list d[da] is not equal to 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged. The list `processing` may have some of its elements set to 1, specifically those elements at indices `di - 1` where `di` is an element of the list `d[da]` and `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The variable `da` remains unchanged. The variable `tmp` will be the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The list `rank` remains unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The list `rank` is updated such that `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns `tmp + 1` where `tmp` is the minimum value of recursive calls to `func_12` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The list `rank` is updated such that `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
