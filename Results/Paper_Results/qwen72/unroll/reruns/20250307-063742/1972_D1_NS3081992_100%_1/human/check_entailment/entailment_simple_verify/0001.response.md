### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read two integers `n` and `m`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15()`.
   - The function `func_15()` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Algorithm in `func_15()`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is derived from the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer, and `a` must be a multiple of `b`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is intended to ensure that `a` remains within the range `1 <= a <= n`.

5. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not directly derived from the problem's mathematical condition.
   - The correct condition to check is whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is a heuristic that may not cover all valid pairs `(a, b)`.

6. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not a valid condition for the problem.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` and then finding the corresponding `a` values that satisfy the condition.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does handle the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly.
   - However, for larger values of `n` and `m`, the program may miss valid pairs due to the incorrect loop condition.

8. **Output**:
   - The program writes the result for each test case to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.
   - This part is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not mathematically sound and may miss valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
