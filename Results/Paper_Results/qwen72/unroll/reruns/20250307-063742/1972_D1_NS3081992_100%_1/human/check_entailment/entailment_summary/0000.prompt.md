Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value. The function assumes that the input is a valid integer and does not handle invalid input cases. After the function concludes, the integer value read from the standard input is returned, and no other changes are made to the program state.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from standard input, expecting one or more space-separated integers, and returns an iterator that yields these integers as individual integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been processed and an iterator is available to iterate over the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a list of integers. The state of the program after the function concludes includes a list of integers that were read from the input.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the modified line.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each resulting string to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function affects the program state by consuming input from the user and producing a list of integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input as the return value.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user. After the function concludes, the program has received an integer input from the user and this value is returned.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of the resulting strings. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being `0`). The function updates the `rank` list such that `rank[da - 1]` is set to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus one. The final return value is this minimum value plus one. The dictionary `d` and the integer `da` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of recursively calling `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The function ultimately computes and returns a tuple of three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` up to index `n-1` where a[i] is less than `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the decrements, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a`, `n`, or `m`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) obtained from the function `func_7`. The function calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or up to `m` if that condition is not met. The final result is this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output contains the results of `func_15()` for each test case, each on a new line. Variables outside the function remain unchanged.
