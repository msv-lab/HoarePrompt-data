Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `m + 1` if that condition is met.**

In natural language, this means:
- The program calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` starting from 1 up to the final value of `i - 1`, where `i` is determined by the condition that `i * i > n + i` or `i` is `m + 1` if that condition is met.
- After calculating this sum, the program returns `ans - 1`.
