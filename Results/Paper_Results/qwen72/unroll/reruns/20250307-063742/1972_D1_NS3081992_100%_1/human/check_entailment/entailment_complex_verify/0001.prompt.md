You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being `0`). The function updates the `rank` list such that `rank[da - 1]` is set to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus one. The final return value is this minimum value plus one.

    #The program returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and `b` is not equal to 0. The first element of the tuple is `y`, the second element is `x` minus the integer division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `y`, and the third element is `g`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of recursively calling `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The function ultimately computes and returns a tuple of three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.

        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer where k has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` up to index `n-1` where a[i] is less than `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the decrements, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a`, `n`, or `m`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1

        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `m + 1` or the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `m + 1` if that condition is met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) obtained from the function `func_7`. The function calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or up to `m` if that condition is not met. The final result is this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on external functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` to provide the number of test cases and the result for each test case, respectively.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, the result of `func_15()` has been written to the standard output followed by a newline character. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output contains the results of `func_15()` for each test case, each on a new line. Variables outside the function remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15()`.
   - The function `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Algorithm in `func_15()`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is derived from the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer, and `a` must be a multiple of `b`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` ensures that `a` remains within the range `1 <= a <= n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as demonstrated in the example.

6. **Output**:
   - The program writes the result for each test case to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. The algorithm and the loop conditions are mathematically sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
