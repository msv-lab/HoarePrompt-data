Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15()` is intended to solve the given problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The logic in `func_15()` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not correctly capture the required pairs. For example, consider the input (n=2, m=3):

- The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3).
- However, the function `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs.

To verify, let's manually check the pairs for (n=2, m=3):

- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\).
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\).

- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\).

- For \(a = 3\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
  - \(b = 2\): \(3 + 2 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(3, 2) = 2\).
  - \(b = 3\): \(3 + 3 = 6\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3\).

The correct count of valid pairs for (n=2, m=3) should be 3, but the function `func_15()` does not produce this result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
