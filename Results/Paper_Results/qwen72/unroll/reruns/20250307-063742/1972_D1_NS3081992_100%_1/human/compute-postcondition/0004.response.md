Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output contains the results of `func_15()` for each test case, each on a new line. Variables outside the function remain unchanged. **
