### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, which reads and returns a list of integers from the input.

2. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function iterates over `i` starting from 1 and continues as long as `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - `func_16()` calls `func_15()` for each test case and writes the result to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
- The function `func_15` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

- The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not immediately clear and does not seem to directly correspond to the problem's conditions. This condition might be a heuristic or optimization, but it is not straightforward to verify its correctness without further context.

### Verification of Conditions:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
  - \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\)
  - This implies that \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- The function `func_15` does not explicitly check this condition. Instead, it uses a loop and a formula that might be an optimization but does not clearly reflect the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_15` does not appear to correctly implement the logic for counting valid pairs based on the given conditions. The loop condition and the formula used inside the loop do not directly correspond to the problem's requirements.
- Therefore, the program as a whole does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
