Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` is indeed flawed and does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues with `func_15()`:

1. **Incorrect Condition and Calculation**:
   - The condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not correctly capture the required pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to the smallest integer such that \(i * i > n + i\) or up to \(m\), but this does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Manual Verification**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((2, 3)\).
     - The function `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to 2 (since \(2 * 2 = 4\) and \(4 > 2 + 1\)), and the calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not correspond to the required pairs.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly count the pairs, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct logic would involve a nested loop over \(a\) and \(b\) and a check for the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
