#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being `0`). The function updates the `rank` list such that `rank[da - 1]` is set to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus one. The final return value is this minimum value plus one. The dictionary `d` and the integer `da` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.

The first element of the tuple is `y`, the second element is `x` minus the integer division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `y`, and the third element is `g`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of recursively calling `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The function ultimately computes and returns a tuple of three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` up to index `n-1` where a[i] is less than `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the decrements, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a`, `n`, or `m`.

    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `m + 1` if that condition is met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) obtained from the function `func_7`. The function calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or up to `m` if that condition is not met. The final result is this sum minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output contains the results of `func_15()` for each test case, each on a new line. Variables outside the function remain unchanged.
