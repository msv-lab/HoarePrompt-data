You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15()`.
   - The function `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Algorithm in `func_15()`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is derived from the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer, and `a` must be a multiple of `b`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` ensures that `a` remains within the range `1 <= a <= n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as demonstrated in the example.

6. **Output**:
   - The program writes the result for each test case to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. The algorithm and the loop conditions are mathematically sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
