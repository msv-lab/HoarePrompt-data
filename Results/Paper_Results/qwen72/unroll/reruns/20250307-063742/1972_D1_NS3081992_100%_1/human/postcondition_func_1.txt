The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from standard input, expecting one or more space-separated integers, and returns an iterator that yields these integers as individual integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been processed and an iterator is available to iterate over the integers.
