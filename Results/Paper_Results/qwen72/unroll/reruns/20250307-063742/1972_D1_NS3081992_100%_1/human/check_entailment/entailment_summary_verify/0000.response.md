### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues with `func_15()`:

1. **Condition `i * i <= n + i`**:
   - This condition is not directly related to the problem's requirements. The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The condition `i * i <= n + i` does not capture this requirement and is likely a mistake.

2. **Calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)`**:
   - This calculation is also not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem needs to count pairs where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but this calculation does not reflect that logic.

3. **Manual Verification for (n=2, m=3)**:
   - The valid pairs for \(n=2\) and \(m=3\) are indeed \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), and \((2,3)\). However, the function `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. The function's logic is flawed and does not produce the correct result.

Given the function summary for `func_16()`, it correctly calls `func_15()` for each test case and writes the result to the standard output. However, since `func_15()` is incorrect, the overall program is also incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
