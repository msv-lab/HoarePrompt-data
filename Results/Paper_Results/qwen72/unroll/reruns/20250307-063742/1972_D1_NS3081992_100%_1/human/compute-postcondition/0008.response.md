Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of recursively calling `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The function ultimately computes and returns a tuple of three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. **
