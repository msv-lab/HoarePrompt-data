### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read two integers `n` and `m`.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15()`.
   - The function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Algorithm in `func_15()`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is derived from the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer, and `a` must be a multiple of `b`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` ensures that `a` remains within the range `1 <= a <= n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly, as it only counts the pair `(1, 1)`.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as demonstrated in the example.

6. **Output**:
   - The program writes the result for each test case to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_15()`:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is derived from the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This condition ensures that `a` remains within the valid range.
- **Calculation**: The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b = i`. This is because `a` must be a multiple of `i` and within the range `1 <= a <= n`.
- **Subtraction**: The final result is `ans - 1` to exclude the pair `(0, 0)` which is not valid as `a` and `b` must be positive integers.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1, m = 1`
  - Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 10, m = 8`
  - Valid pairs: `(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)`
  - Output: `14`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000, m = 1145141`
  - The program should handle this large input efficiently.
  - Output: `1643498`
  - Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. The algorithm and the loop conditions are mathematically sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
