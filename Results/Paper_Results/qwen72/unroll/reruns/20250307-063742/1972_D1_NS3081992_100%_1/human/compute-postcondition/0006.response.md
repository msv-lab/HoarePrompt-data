The function `func_15` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i - 1`. The final value of `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or `m + 1` if that condition is not met.

Functionality: **The function implicitly involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `i - 1` such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met.**
