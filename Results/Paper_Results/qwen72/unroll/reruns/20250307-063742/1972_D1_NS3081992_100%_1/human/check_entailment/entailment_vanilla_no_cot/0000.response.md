Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs, but its logic is flawed. Specifically, the condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirement that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. However, this brute-force approach would be too slow for the given constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6). A more efficient approach is required, such as precomputing the number of valid pairs for all possible values of `b` and then summing these values for each test case.

The provided program does not implement such an efficient approach, and the logic in `func_15` is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
