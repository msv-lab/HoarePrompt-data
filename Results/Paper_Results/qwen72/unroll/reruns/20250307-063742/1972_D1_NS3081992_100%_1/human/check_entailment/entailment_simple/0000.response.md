Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_15()` to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Function `func_15()`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the standard input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a while loop where it iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)`.
   - After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop in `func_15()` is designed to count the valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in the problem).
   - The condition `i * i <= n + i` is used to ensure that the loop does not run indefinitely and is based on the mathematical properties of the problem.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b` value.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, returning 1 as expected.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The loop in `func_15()` runs in \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \( 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 \).

6. **Output:**
   - The program writes the result of `func_15()` for each test case to the standard output, followed by a newline character, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
