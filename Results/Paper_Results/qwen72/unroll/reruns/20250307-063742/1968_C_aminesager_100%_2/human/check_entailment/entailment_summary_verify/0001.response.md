### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Element \( a_1 \):**
   - The program initializes \( a_1 \) with the value 1000. This is a valid choice because \( 1 \le 1000 \le 10^9 \). However, it is important to note that the choice of 1000 is arbitrary and not necessarily the smallest possible value. The problem allows for any valid \( a_1 \), so 1000 is a safe choice.

2. **Subsequent Elements \( a_i \):**
   - The program constructs each subsequent element \( a_i \) as \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \). This ensures that:
     - \( a_2 = a_1 + x_2 \)
     - \( a_3 = a_2 + x_3 \)
     - And so on, up to \( a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n \)
   - By construction, \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i \) is exactly \( a_{i-1} \) plus \( x_i \). The remainder of \( a_{i-1} + x_i \) divided by \( a_{i-1} \) is \( x_i \).

3. **Range Constraints:**
   - Each \( a_i \) is constructed as \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \), where \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \) and \( 1 \le a_{i-1} \le 10^9 \).
   - Therefore, \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 + 500 \), which is within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func`. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading \( n \) and the array \( x \), constructs the array \( a \) as described, and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \( a \) such that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). The initial choice of \( a_1 = 1000 \) is valid, and the subsequent elements are constructed in a way that satisfies the problem constraints. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate.

Final: **True**
