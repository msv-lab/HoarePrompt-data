Output State: **t = 0, n remains unchanged, x remains unchanged, a is a list of n integers where each integer is the cumulative sum of the elements in T up to that index, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the list a.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **t**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` becomes 0.
- **n**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop. However, it is re-assigned in each iteration of the loop based on user input.
- **x**: The list `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **a**: The list `a` is constructed in each iteration of the loop. It starts with a single element `[1000]` and then appends the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to each index. For example, if `T` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `a` will be `[1000, 1001, 1003, 1006]`.
- **result**: The variable `result` is a string that contains the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. This string is printed in each iteration of the loop.
