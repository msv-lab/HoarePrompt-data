Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input values for `x` are such that the constructed array `a` does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 2
```
The program constructs the array `a` as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
- `a[2] = 1001 + 2 = 1003`

The output is:
```
1000 1001 1003
```

However, this does not satisfy the condition:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1003 \bmod 1001 = 2 \), which is correct.
- \( a_1 \bmod a_0 = 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \), which is correct.

But the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 1000, which is not a valid value since \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) and \( a_1 \bmod a_0 \) should be equal to \( x_1 \), which is 1 in this case. The program should ensure that the first element of `a` is chosen such that the conditions are met for all elements.

A correct approach would be to initialize `a[0]` to a value that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `x` and then construct the array `a` accordingly. For instance, initializing `a[0]` to 1001 in the above example would work:
- `a[0] = 1001`
- `a[1] = 1001 + 1 = 1002`
- `a[2] = 1002 + 2 = 1004`

The output would be:
```
1001 1002 1004
```

This satisfies the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1004 \bmod 1002 = 2 \)
- \( a_1 \bmod a_0 = 1002 \bmod 1001 = 1 \)

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the initialization of `a[0]` properly.
