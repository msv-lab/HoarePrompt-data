The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `x`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The function returns a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `x`. It returns a value based on the input parameters, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, each between 1 and 500.**
