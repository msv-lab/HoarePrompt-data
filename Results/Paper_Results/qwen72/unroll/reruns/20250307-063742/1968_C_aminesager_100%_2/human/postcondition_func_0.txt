The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a line of `n-1` space-separated integers. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements read from the input up to that index. The function prints this list as a space-separated string and repeats this process for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` being 0, `n` and `x` remaining unchanged, and `a` being a list of `n` integers representing the cumulative sums.
