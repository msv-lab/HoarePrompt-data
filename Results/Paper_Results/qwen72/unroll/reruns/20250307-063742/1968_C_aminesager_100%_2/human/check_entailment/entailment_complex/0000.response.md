### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - The function initializes the list `a` with a single element `[1000]`. This is a valid starting point because `1000` is within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates through the list `T` (which contains the elements `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) and appends the cumulative sum of the elements to the list `a`.
   - Specifically, for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to the list `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the list `a` as a space-separated string.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
   - Let's verify this with the cumulative sum approach:
     - For `i = 2`, `a_2 = a_1 + x_2`. Therefore, `a_2 % a_1 = (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2`.
     - For `i = 3`, `a_3 = a_2 + x_3`. Therefore, `a_3 % a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) % a_2 = x_3`.
     - This pattern continues for all `i` from `2` to `n`.

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly:
     - `t` is within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
     - `n` is within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
     - Each `x_i` is within the range `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The function processes each test case correctly and prints the required output.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly computes and prints the list `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
