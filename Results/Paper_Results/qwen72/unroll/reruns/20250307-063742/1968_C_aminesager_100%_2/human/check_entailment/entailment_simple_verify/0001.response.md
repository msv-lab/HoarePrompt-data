### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases \( t \) and the number of elements \( n \) in the array \( a \) for each test case.
   - It also reads \( n-1 \) integers \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \) for each test case.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the array \( a \) with a single element \( 1000 \). This is a valid choice because \( 1 \le 1000 \le 10^9 \).

3. **Array Construction:**
   - The program constructs the array \( a \) by iterating from \( i = 1 \) to \( n-1 \) and appending \( a[i-1] + T[i-1] \) to \( a \).
   - This ensures that \( a_2 = a_1 + x_2 \), \( a_3 = a_2 + x_3 \), and so on.
   - The modulo operation \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) will always yield \( x_i \) because \( a_i \) is constructed as \( a_{i-1} + x_i \), and the remainder of \( a_{i-1} + x_i \) divided by \( a_{i-1} \) is \( x_i \).

4. **Range Constraints:**
   - Each \( a_i \) is constructed as \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \), where \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \) and \( 1 \le a_{i-1} \le 10^9 \).
   - Therefore, \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 + 500 \), which is within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array \( a \) for each test case, which is a string of space-separated integers representing the list \( a \).

### Annotated Code Verification:
- **Initial State:**
  - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \).
  - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 500 \).
  - \( T \) is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \).

- **Inside the Loop:**
  - \( a \) is initialized with \( 1000 \).
  - For each \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \), \( a[i] \) is set to \( a[i-1] + T[i-1] \).
  - This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

- **Final State:**
  - \( t = 0 \) after processing all test cases.
  - \( n \) and \( T \) remain unchanged.
  - \( a \) is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer is the cumulative sum of the elements in \( T \) up to that index.
  - \( result \) is a string of space-separated integers representing the list \( a \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \( a \) such that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). The initial choice of \( a_1 = 1000 \) is valid, and the subsequent elements are constructed in a way that satisfies the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
