### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - The program initializes the array `a` with a starting value of 1000. This is a valid choice because `1000` is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Loop through `T`**:
   - The program then iterates through the list `T` (which contains the values `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`), and for each element `T[i-1]`, it appends the value `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to the list `a`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]` because `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]` and the remainder of `a[i]` when divided by `a[i-1]` is `T[i-1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `a` as a space-separated string, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, `T` will have only one element, and the program will generate a list `a` with two elements: `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`.
   - The program also handles the case where `T` contains the maximum value `500` correctly, as `a[i]` will always be greater than `a[i-1]` and within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints are respected: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` and `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
