Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (n, k, and the k moves).

2. **Tracking Moves**: The program tracks the number of moves where the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., where r = c) and non-diagonal moves. This is important because diagonal moves do not result in the computer making a move, while non-diagonal moves do.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: The program calculates the number of remaining moves (m) by subtracting the total number of moves (both diagonal and non-diagonal) from the board size (n).

4. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program sets up a dynamic programming (DP) array to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining moves. The DP array is initialized with base cases:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One rook can be placed in one way.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Two rooks can be placed in three ways (one on the diagonal, and two non-diagonal configurations).

5. **DP Transition**: The program correctly transitions through the DP array using the formula:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
   This formula accounts for:
   - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which leaves the previous configuration unchanged (`dp[i - 1]`).
   - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing the computer's rook in a different row and column, which results in two new configurations (`(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`).

6. **Output**: The program prints the final number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of valid configurations. Therefore, the program is correct.
