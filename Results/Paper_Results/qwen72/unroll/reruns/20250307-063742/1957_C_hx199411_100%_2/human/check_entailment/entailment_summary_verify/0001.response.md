### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook at \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn, and only one rook is placed.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - The initial moves are given as pairs \((r_i, c_i)\).

3. **Initial Moves and Computer Mirroring:**
   - For each initial move \((r_i, c_i)\):
     - If \( r_i = c_i \), the computer skips its turn, and only one rook is placed.
     - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), the computer places a black rook at \((c_i, r_i)\), resulting in two rooks being placed.

4. **Counting Valid Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of rooks already placed on the board.
   - For each move \((r_i, c_i)\):
     - If \( r_i = c_i \), `num` is incremented by 1.
     - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), `num` is incremented by 2.

5. **Remaining Moves:**
   - The number of remaining moves \( m \) is calculated as \( n - num \).
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), there is only one possible configuration (either no more moves or one final move).

6. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves:**
   - For \( m \geq 2 \), a dynamic programming approach is used to count the number of valid configurations.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for \( i \) remaining moves.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[1] = 1` (one rook can be placed in one way).
     - `dp[2] = 3` (three configurations: one white rook and one black rook, or two white rooks, or two black rooks).
     - For \( i \geq 3 \):
       - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
         - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for placing one rook in the current move.
         - \((i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2\) accounts for placing two rooks in the current move, considering the two possible colors for the rooks.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed as `dp[m]`.

### Evaluation:

- **Initial Moves and Computer Mirroring:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of rooks placed based on the initial moves and the computer's mirroring behavior.

- **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
  - The calculation of remaining moves \( m \) is correct: \( m = n - num \).

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented to count the number of valid configurations for the remaining moves.
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct and efficiently handles the problem constraints.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the result for each test case, ensuring the output is modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations based on the given problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for handling the remaining moves and ensuring the configurations are counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Final: **True**
