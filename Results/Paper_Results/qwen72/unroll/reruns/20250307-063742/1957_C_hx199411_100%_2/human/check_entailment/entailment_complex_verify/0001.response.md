### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook at \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn, and only one rook is placed.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - The initial moves are given as pairs \((r_i, c_i)\).

3. **Initial Moves and Computer Mirroring:**
   - For each initial move \((r_i, c_i)\):
     - If \( r_i = c_i \), the computer skips its turn, and only one rook is placed.
     - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), the computer places a black rook at \((c_i, r_i)\), resulting in two rooks being placed.

4. **Counting Valid Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of rooks already placed on the board.
   - For each move \((r_i, c_i)\):
     - If \( r_i = c_i \), `num` is incremented by 1.
     - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), `num` is incremented by 2.

5. **Remaining Moves:**
   - The number of remaining moves \( m \) is calculated as \( n - num \).
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), there is only one possible configuration (either no more moves or one final move).

6. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves:**
   - For \( m \geq 2 \), a dynamic programming approach is used to count the number of valid configurations.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for \( i \) remaining moves.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[1] = 1` (one rook can be placed in one way).
     - `dp[2] = 3` (three configurations: one white rook and one black rook, or two white rooks, or two black rooks).
     - For \( i \geq 3 \):
       - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
         - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for placing one rook in the current move.
         - \((i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2\) accounts for placing two rooks in the current move, considering the two possible colors for the rooks.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed as `dp[m]`.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `t = int(input())` correctly reads the number of test cases.
  - The loop `while t:` ensures that the function processes each test case.

- **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
  - `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.
  - `num = 0` initializes the count of rooks already placed.

- **Processing Initial Moves:**
  - The loop `for i in range(k):` iterates over the initial moves.
  - `(c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads each move.
  - The condition `if c == r:` correctly increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal.
  - The condition `else:` correctly increments `num` by 2 if the move is not on the diagonal.

- **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
  - `m = n - num` correctly calculates the number of remaining moves.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - `if m == 0:` and `elif m == 1:` correctly handle the cases where no more moves can be made or only one move can be made, printing 1 in both cases.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - `dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]` initializes the DP array.
  - `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` correctly set the base cases.
  - The loop `for i in range(3, m + 1):` correctly fills the DP array using the recurrence relation.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct and ensures the result is modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Final Output:**
  - `print(dp[m])` correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations based on the given problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for handling the remaining moves and ensuring the configurations are counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Final: **True**
