The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `k` moves, where each move is a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
