Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the final output state is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` are no longer relevant as they are reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
- For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read from the input, `num` is initialized to 0, and the loop processes `k` moves to update `num`.
- `m` is then calculated as `n - num`.
- Depending on the value of `m`, the loop either prints 1 (if `m` is 0 or 1) or calculates and prints the value of `dp[m]` using a dynamic programming approach.
- After the loop completes, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` will not be retained from the last iteration, as they are reinitialized in each iteration.
