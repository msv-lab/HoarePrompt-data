Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial k moves include a move where the row and column are the same (i.e., `r_i == c_i`). According to the problem description, if `r_i == c_i`, the computer skips its turn. However, the program incorrectly increments `num` by 1 in such cases, which is not the correct behavior. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the number of possible final configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```
This is because after the initial move at (1, 1), the computer skips its turn, and you can place rooks in the following configurations:
1. Place a white rook at (2, 2) and a white rook at (3, 3).
2. Place a white rook at (2, 2) and a white rook at (4, 4).
3. Place a white rook at (3, 3) and a white rook at (4, 4).

Thus, the program is incorrect.
