### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of rooks that have been placed on the board.

2. **Move Processing:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of rooks already placed on the board.
   - For each move `(c, r)`, if `c == r`, it means the computer skips its turn, so `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `c != r`, both the player and the computer place a rook, so `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining moves.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` (one rook can be placed in one way) and `dp[2] = 3` (two rooks can be placed in three ways).
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, the number of configurations is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering both the player's and the computer's moves.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes the input and calculates the number of rooks already placed.
- The dynamic programming approach is used to efficiently compute the number of possible final configurations, which is a valid and efficient method for this problem.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

### Correctness:
