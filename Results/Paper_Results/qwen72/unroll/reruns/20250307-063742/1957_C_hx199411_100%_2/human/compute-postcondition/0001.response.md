For the `while` loop to execute the first time, the condition `t` must be true. Since `t` is an input integer and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is already in a state where it can be true (i.e., non-zero). Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and all moves are valid.**
