Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve a problem where you and a computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks can attack each other. The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case it skips its turn.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting**:
   - The program counts the number of moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` (diagonal moves) and adds 1 to `num` for each such move.
   - For moves where `r_i` does not equal `c_i`, it adds 2 to `num` because each such move results in two rooks (one white and one black) being placed on the board.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining positions `m` as `n - num`.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board by considering:
       - Placing a rook in the first row and column, reducing the problem to an \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board.
       - Placing a rook in the first row and a different column, and then placing a rook in the first column and a different row, reducing the problem to an \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the moves.
- The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly accounts for the different configurations of rooks on the board.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. It correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations and uses dynamic programming to handle the combinatorial aspect of the problem efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
