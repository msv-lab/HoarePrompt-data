Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it processes integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `k` moves, where each move is a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. It calculates a value based on the number of moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` and the number of moves where `r_i` does not equal `c_i`. The function then computes a result using dynamic programming and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` being reinitialized for each test case. **
