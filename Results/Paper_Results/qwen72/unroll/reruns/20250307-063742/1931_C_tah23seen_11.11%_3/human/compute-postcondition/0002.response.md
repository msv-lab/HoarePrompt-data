The variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

- Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`.
- Since `i` is 0, the condition `i <= j` will be true as long as `j` is non-negative.
- Given that `j` is `len(arr) - 1` and `len(arr)` is at least 1, `j` will be non-negative, ensuring the loop can execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
