Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array elements, then calling `func_1` and printing the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to move the pointers towards the center of the array as long as the elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are equal, it increments `i` and decrements `j`.
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the array is already a palindrome, and no operation is needed, so it returns 0. This is correct.
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, it breaks out of the loop. This is also correct.

3. **Handling of Consecutive Equal Elements:**
   - The original program only checks if `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` and increments `i` to skip over consecutive equal elements from the start.
   - However, it does not check for consecutive equal elements from the end (`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`) and decrement `j` accordingly. This is a significant oversight because the optimal solution might involve making the subarray from `i` to `j` equal by choosing a value that matches the elements at the boundaries.
   - For example, in the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the program will incorrectly return 2 instead of 3 because it does not handle the consecutive 8s at the end.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already all the same value by returning 0.
   - For an array of length 1, the cost is 0, which is correctly handled.
   - For an array of length 2, the cost is 1 if the elements are different, and 0 if they are the same. The program handles this correctly.

5. **Correctness of the Final Return:**
   - The final return statement `return j - i` is incorrect. It should be `return j - i + 1` to account for the inclusive range. This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
    if i > j:
        return 0
    while i < j and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    while i < j and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    return j - i + 1
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected program ensures that both the start and end pointers skip over consecutive equal elements.
- It correctly handles the case where the array is already all the same value by returning 0.
- It correctly calculates the length of the subarray that needs to be modified by returning `j - i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct solution.

Final: **False**
