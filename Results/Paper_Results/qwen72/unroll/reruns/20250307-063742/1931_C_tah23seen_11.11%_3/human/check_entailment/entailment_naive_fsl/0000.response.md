Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the array has all distinct elements correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output is `2` because the minimum cost to make all elements equal is to select `i = 1`, `j = 3`, and `x = 1` (or any other value), which costs `3 - 1 + 1 = 3` burles. However, the program will incorrectly return `1` because it only checks for the first and last elements being different and then returns `j - i`, which is `2 - 1 = 1`.

This shows that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles required in all cases, making it incorrect.
