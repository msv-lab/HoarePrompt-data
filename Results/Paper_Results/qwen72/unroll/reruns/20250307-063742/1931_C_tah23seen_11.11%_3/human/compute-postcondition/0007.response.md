To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The program state right before the loop includes the following:

- The loop will either exit with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if `arr` is a palindrome, or it will exit with `i <= j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]` if `arr` is not a palindrome.
- Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

Given these conditions, the loop can only execute if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. However, the current state does not guarantee that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **The loop will either exit with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if `arr` is a palindrome, or it will exit with `i <= j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]` if `arr` is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**
