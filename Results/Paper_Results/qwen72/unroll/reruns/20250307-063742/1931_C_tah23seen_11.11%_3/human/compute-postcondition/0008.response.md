Output State: **The loop will exit with `i` incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaches the end of the array. The value of `j` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop will exit, and `i` will be the index where this inequality is first encountered. If the loop reaches the end of the array (i.e., `i` becomes equal to the length of `arr` minus 1), it will also exit. The value of `j` is not affected by the loop, so it remains the same as in the initial state.
