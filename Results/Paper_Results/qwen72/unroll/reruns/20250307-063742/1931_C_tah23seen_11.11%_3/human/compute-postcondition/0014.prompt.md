You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop will either exit with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if `arr` is a palindrome, or it will exit with `i <= j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]` if `arr` is not a palindrome.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: The loop will either exit with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if `arr` is a palindrome, or it will exit with `i <= j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]` if `arr` is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop will exit with `i` incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaches the end of the array. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which the loop exits due to `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaching the end of the array, and `j` is an index that remains unchanged and is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
    #State: The loop will exit with `i` incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaches the end of the array. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index at which the loop exits, either because `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or because `i` reaches the end of the array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns 0 if the elements are all the same or if the loop exits in a specific way. Otherwise, it returns the difference between two indices `j` and `i`, adjusted based on the conditions under which the loop exits.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which the loop exits due to `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaching the end of the array, and `j` is an index that remains unchanged and is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index at which the loop exits, either because `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or because `i` reaches the end of the array.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
