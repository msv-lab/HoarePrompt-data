Output State: **The loop will either exit with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if `arr` is a palindrome, or it will exit with `i <= j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]` if `arr` is not a palindrome.**

In natural language, this means:
- If the list `arr` is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards), the loop will continue to increment `i` and decrement `j` until `i` is greater than `j`. At this point, the loop will exit, and `i` will be one more than `j`.
- If the list `arr` is not a palindrome, the loop will exit as soon as it finds a pair of elements `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` that are not equal, with `i` still less than or equal to `j`.
