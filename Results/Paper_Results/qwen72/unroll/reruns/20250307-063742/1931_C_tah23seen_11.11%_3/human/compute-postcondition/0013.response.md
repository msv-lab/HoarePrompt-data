The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and the length of the list.

Case_1: The function returns 0.

Case_2: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which the loop exits because `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` reaches the end of the array, and `j` is an index that remains unchanged and is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.

Case_3: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1 and `i` is the index at which the loop exits, either because `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or because `i` reaches the end of the array.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns 0 if the elements are all the same or if the loop exits in a specific way. Otherwise, it returns the difference between two indices `j` and `i`, adjusted based on the conditions under which the loop exits.**
