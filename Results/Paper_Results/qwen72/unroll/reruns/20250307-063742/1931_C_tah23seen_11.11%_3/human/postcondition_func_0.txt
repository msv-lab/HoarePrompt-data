The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks if the list is a palindrome. If the list is a palindrome, it returns 0. If the list is not a palindrome, it returns the length of the longest prefix or suffix that is a palindrome, adjusted based on the conditions under which the loop exits. Specifically, if the loop exits with `j` not equal to the last index of the array, it returns `j - i + 1`. If the loop exits with `j` equal to the last index of the array, it returns `j - i`.
