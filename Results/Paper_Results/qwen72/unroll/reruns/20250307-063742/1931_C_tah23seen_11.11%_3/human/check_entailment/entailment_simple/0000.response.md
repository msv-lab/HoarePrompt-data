### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop to check if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from both ends. If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, it moves the pointers inward. If it finds a mismatch, it breaks the loop.
   - If the loop completes with `i > j`, it means the array is a palindrome, and the function returns 0 because no operation is needed.
   - If the loop breaks due to a mismatch, it then enters another loop to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns `j - i + 1` as the cost of the operation.
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, it returns `j - i` as the cost of the operation.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies if the array is a palindrome and returns 0 if it is.
   - The second loop is intended to find the first mismatched element from the start, but it does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements that are not in a palindromic pattern.
   - The logic for returning the cost of the operation is incorrect. The cost should be the length of the subarray that needs to be modified to make the entire array equal, which is `j - i + 1` in all cases where the array is not a palindrome.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is a palindrome.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements that are not in a palindromic pattern. The logic for finding the cost of the operation is flawed and does not always return the correct minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not always compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the logic for determining the cost of the operation is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.
