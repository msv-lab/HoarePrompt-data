Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and assigning a common value to its elements. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It first checks if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and the end, moving inward. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0 because no operation is needed.
2. If the array is not a palindrome, it finds the first index `i` from the start where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` and increments `i` until this condition is met.
3. It then checks if `j` (the last index) is not the last index of the array. If `j` is not the last index, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the length of the subarray that needs to be modified.
4. If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is the length of the subarray that needs to be modified.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is not a palindrome and the elements at the start and end are different. It only increments `i` until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`, but it does not consider the possibility of a longer palindrome in the middle of the array.
- The function does not account for the possibility that the minimum cost might be achieved by selecting a different subarray that is not necessarily the longest prefix or suffix.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Identify the most frequent element in the array, as assigning all elements to this value will minimize the cost.
2. Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element by counting how many elements are different from it and summing their lengths.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly handle all cases and may return incorrect results for non-palindromic arrays.

Correctness: **False**
