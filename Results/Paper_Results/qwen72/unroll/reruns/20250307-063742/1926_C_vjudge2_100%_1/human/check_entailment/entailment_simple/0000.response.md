### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, computing the sum of the digits of each integer `i` using the function `func_1`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the updated `sum` is appended to the list `A`.
   - This precomputation step ensures that `A[n-1]` will contain the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - Finally, it returns `a`, which is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.

3. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `A[n-1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(200000 * log(200000)) time, which is feasible given the constraints.
   - The actual test case handling runs in O(t) time, which is efficient for up to 10^4 test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Function**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer.
   - The state comments are accurate: `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0 after the loop.

6. **Correctness of the Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
