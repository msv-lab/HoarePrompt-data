Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the list `A`.
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. This is verified by the function summary, which states that `func_1` returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `A[n - 1]`. This approach ensures that the sum of the numbers on the board is correctly calculated for each test case.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. This is done once and is efficient.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.

4. **Correctness for Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` (output is 1).
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200,000, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

5. **Time Limit**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time, which is well within the time limit.

6. **Code Verification**:
   - The code initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to 200,000, calculates the sum of the digits for each number using `func_1`, adds this sum to the cumulative sum, and appends the cumulative sum to the list `A`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `A[n - 1]`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem description and meets all the requirements, including handling edge cases and being efficient within the time limit.

Final: **True**
