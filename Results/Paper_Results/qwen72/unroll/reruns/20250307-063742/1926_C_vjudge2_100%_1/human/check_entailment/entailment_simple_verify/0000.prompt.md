You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Annotated Code: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the list `A`.
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `A[n - 1]`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. This is done once and is efficient.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.

4. **Correctness for Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` (output is 1).
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200,000, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

5. **Time Limit**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time.

Given the above points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case and is therefore correct.
