Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the list `A`.
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. This is verified by the annotations:
     - Before the function call, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
     - Inside the function, the loop `while num != 0` iterates through each digit of `num`, adding it to `a` and then reducing `num` by removing the last digit.
     - After the loop, `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0.
     - The function returns `a`, which is the correct sum of the digits.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `A[n - 1]`.
   - This is efficient and correct because `A[n - 1]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is 200,000. This is done once and is efficient.
   - Each test case is handled in \(O(1)\) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.

4. **Correctness for Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` (output is 1).
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200,000, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

5. **Time Limit**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time.

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the problem description and meets all the requirements, including efficiency and handling edge cases.

Final: **True**
