Output State: **`a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` is 0.**

Natural language explanation: After the loop has finished executing, the variable `a` will hold the sum of all the digits of the initial value of `num`. The variable `num` will be 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it becomes 0.
