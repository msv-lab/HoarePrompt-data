Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**: The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in a list `A`. This is efficient and allows for quick lookups during the test cases.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder of `num` when divided by 10 (which gives the last digit) and adding it to the sum `a`, then dividing `num` by 10 (integer division) to remove the last digit. This process continues until `num` becomes 0.

3. **Cumulative Sum Storage**: The program maintains a cumulative sum in the list `A`. For each number `i` from 1 to 200000, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` using `func_1` and adds this to the current cumulative sum `sum`. The result is then appended to the list `A`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum for `n` from the list `A`.

5. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000, which is feasible. Each test case then runs in O(1) time, as it simply involves a list lookup.

6. **Correct Output**: The program will correctly output the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` for each test case, as required by the problem.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements and constraints of the problem and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.
