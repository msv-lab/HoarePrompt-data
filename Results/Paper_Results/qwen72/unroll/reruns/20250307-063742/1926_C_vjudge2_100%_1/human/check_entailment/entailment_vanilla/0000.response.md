### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program starts by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these sums in a list `A`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to 200,000. For each number `i`, it calls the function `func_1(i)` to get the sum of its digits and adds this to the cumulative sum `sum`.
   - The cumulative sum `sum` is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(num)` calculates the sum of the digits of the number `num`.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder of `num` when divided by 10 (which gives the last digit) and adding it to `a`, then dividing `num` by 10 to remove the last digit.
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the sum of the digits `a`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed sum of digit sums for the numbers from 1 to `n` by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

### Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is the maximum value (200,000). This is efficient and can be done within a reasonable time.
  - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed list `A`.
  - Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, the precomputation can be done once and reused for all test cases, making the solution efficient.

- **Correctness:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
  - The precomputation step correctly builds the list `A` with the cumulative sums of digit sums.
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case by accessing the precomputed list.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
