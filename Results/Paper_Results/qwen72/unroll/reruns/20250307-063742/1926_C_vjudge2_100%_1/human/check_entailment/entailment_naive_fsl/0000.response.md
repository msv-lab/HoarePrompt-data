Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the list `A`.
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `A[n - 1]`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. This is done once and is efficient.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.

4. **Correctness for Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` (output is 1).
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200,000, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

5. **Time Limit**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time.

Given the above points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case and is therefore correct.
