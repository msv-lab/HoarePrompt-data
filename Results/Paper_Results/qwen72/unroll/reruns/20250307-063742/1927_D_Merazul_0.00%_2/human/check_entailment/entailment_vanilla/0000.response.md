Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The program should read multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the length of the array `n`, the array itself, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries.
   - Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, the program should output two indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i, j ≤ r` and `a_i ≠ a_j`.
   - If no such pair exists, the program should output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses a lambda function `R` to read and map input to integers.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` (which should be `n`), the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The program initializes a set `a` and a set `b` with the elements of the array.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (which should be `n`).
   - For each element `i` in the range, it checks if `i` is in `a` or `b`.
   - It updates `m` and `n` based on the presence of `i` in `a` and `b`.
   - Finally, it prints a result based on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of Sets:**
   - The sets `a` and `b` are being used to store the elements of the array, but the problem requires finding indices, not elements.
   - The program does not store the indices of the elements, which is crucial for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Queries:**
   - The program does not process each query individually.
   - It does not check the subarray defined by `l` and `r` for each query.
   - The logic for updating `m` and `n` is not clear and does not seem to be related to the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program prints a string `YNEOS` based on some conditions, which is not the required output format.
   - The required output format is two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array `n`, the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - Read each query and process it.

2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, check the subarray `a[l-1:r]` for two different elements.
   - If such a pair exists, output the indices.
   - If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not handle the indices correctly and does not process each query individually. The logic and output are also incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
