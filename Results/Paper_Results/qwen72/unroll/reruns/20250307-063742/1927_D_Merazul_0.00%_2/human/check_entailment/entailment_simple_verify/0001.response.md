### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - However, it incorrectly reads the length of the array as `k` instead of `n`.
   - It reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q` correctly, but it does not read the queries themselves.

2. **Set Usage:**
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store elements from the input, but this is incorrect because the problem requires finding indices, not elements.
   - The sets `a` and `b` are not used to store the indices of the elements, which is necessary for the problem.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program does not process each query individually.
   - It iterates over a range from 1 to `k` (which should be `n`), but this iteration is not related to the queries.
   - The logic for updating `m` and `n` is not clear and does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints a string `YNEOS` based on some conditions, which is not the required output format.
   - The required output format is two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

5. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations indicate that the program should handle multiple test cases, read the array length `n`, the array `a`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves.
   - However, the program does not read the queries and does not process them correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not handle the indices correctly, does not process each query individually, and the logic and output are incorrect.

Final: **False**
