Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to checking the presence of elements in two sets and performing some bitwise operations. However, it does not address the task of finding pairs of indices with different elements within specified query ranges.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program will not produce this output. It will instead produce an output that is not related to the problem description, such as a series of "YES" or "NO" responses, which is incorrect for this problem.
