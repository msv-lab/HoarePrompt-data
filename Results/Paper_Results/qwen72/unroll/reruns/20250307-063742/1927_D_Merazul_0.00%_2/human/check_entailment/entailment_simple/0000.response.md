Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input in a way that does not align with the problem's input format. The problem specifies that the input should be read in a structured manner, with the number of test cases, the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries. However, the program uses a lambda function `R` to read input, but it does not correctly parse the input according to the problem's requirements.

2. **Array and Set Operations**: The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store elements read from input, but it does not maintain the original order of elements in the array. This is crucial for the problem, as the indices of the elements are important.

3. **Query Processing**: The program does not process the queries as described. It should iterate through the queries and find pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]`. Instead, the program performs operations that do not seem to be related to this task.

4. **Output**: The program prints a string based on a condition that is not relevant to the problem. The correct output should be pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
