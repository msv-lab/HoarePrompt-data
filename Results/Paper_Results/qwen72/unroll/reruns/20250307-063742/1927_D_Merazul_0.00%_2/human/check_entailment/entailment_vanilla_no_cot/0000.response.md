Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding a pair of indices (i, j) within a given range [l, r] such that the elements at these indices are different. However, the program seems to be doing a completely different task. It reads a number of test cases, but the logic inside the loop does not correspond to the task of finding distinct elements within a specified range of an array. Instead, it appears to be checking the presence of elements in two sets and performing bitwise operations, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Reading the array and the queries.
2. For each query, checking if there are any two different elements within the specified range.
3. Outputting the indices of such elements if they exist, or -1 -1 if they do not.

The provided program does not implement these steps correctly, hence it is incorrect.
