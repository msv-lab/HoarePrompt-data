You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The program should read multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the length of the array `n`, the array itself, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries.
   - Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, the program should output two indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i, j ≤ r` and `a_i ≠ a_j`.
   - If no such pair exists, the program should output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses a lambda function `R` to read and map input to integers.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` (which should be `n`), the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The program initializes a set `a` and a set `b` with the elements of the array.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (which should be `n`).
   - For each element `i` in the range, it checks if `i` is in `a` or `b`.
   - It updates `m` and `n` based on the presence of `i` in `a` and `b`.
   - Finally, it prints a result based on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of Sets:**
   - The sets `a` and `b` are being used to store the elements of the array, but the problem requires finding indices, not elements.
   - The program does not store the indices of the elements, which is crucial for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Queries:**
   - The program does not process each query individually.
   - It does not check the subarray defined by `l` and `r` for each query.
   - The logic for updating `m` and `n` is not clear and does not seem to be related to the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program prints a string `YNEOS` based on some conditions, which is not the required output format.
   - The required output format is two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array `n`, the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - Read each query and process it.

2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, check the subarray `a[l-1:r]` for two different elements.
   - If such a pair exists, output the indices.
   - If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not handle the indices correctly and does not process each query individually. The logic and output are also incorrect.
