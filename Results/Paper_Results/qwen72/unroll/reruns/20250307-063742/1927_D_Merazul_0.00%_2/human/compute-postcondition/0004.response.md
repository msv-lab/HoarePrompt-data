The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters. The parameters for each test case are as follows:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le a_i \le 10^6\), representing the elements of the array.
  - `q` is an integer where \(1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), representing the number of queries.
  - Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where \(1 \le l < r \le n\).

The function returns a list of results for each query. The result for each query depends on the specific logic applied to the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, a list `a` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is based on the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.**
