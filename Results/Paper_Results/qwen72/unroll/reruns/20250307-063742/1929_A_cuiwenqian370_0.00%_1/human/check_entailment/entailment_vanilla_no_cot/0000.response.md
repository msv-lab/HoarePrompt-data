Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing this beauty is to maximize the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

However, the provided program does not correctly maximize the beauty. The function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To correctly maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements are placed alternately, but in a way that maximizes the absolute differences between consecutive elements. A more effective approach would be to sort the array and then construct the new array by placing the largest and smallest elements in alternating positions, starting with the largest element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected version should work as intended. However, the original program does not correctly maximize the beauty, so it is incorrect.
