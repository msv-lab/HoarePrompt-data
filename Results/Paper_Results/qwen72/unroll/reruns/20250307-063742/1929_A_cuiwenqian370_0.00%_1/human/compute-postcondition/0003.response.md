Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`.** 

The value of `right` is now `n - 1`, which means `right` is the index of the last element in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
