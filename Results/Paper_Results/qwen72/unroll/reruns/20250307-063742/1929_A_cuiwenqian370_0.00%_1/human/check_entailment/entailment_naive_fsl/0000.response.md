Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Specifically, the approach used in the `func_1` function to rearrange the array does not always maximize the beauty. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program will rearrange the array to `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, and the beauty will be calculated as:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
```

However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, which gives:
```
(4 - 1) + (4 - 2) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
```

But another valid rearrangement that maximizes the beauty is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, which gives:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3
```

The correct maximum beauty for this case is 6, but the program does not consistently produce this result for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
