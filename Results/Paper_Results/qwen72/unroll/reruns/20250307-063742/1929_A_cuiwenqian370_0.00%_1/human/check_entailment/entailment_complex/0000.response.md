Reasoning:

The program aims to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The provided function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the start of the sorted array. This approach is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, thereby maximizing the beauty.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function. The problem statement defines the beauty as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. Therefore, the beauty can be negative if \(a_i < a_{i-1}\). The current implementation of `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted in descending order, and then the beauty should be calculated as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This ensures that each difference is positive, thus maximizing the beauty.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it calculates the sum of absolute differences instead of the sum of differences.

Correctness: **False**
