### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program does not always compute the maximum beauty of the array. Let's analyze the program and the annotated code to determine if this is accurate.

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by sorting the array `arr`. This ensures that the elements are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Constructing the New Array:**
   - The function then constructs a new array `new_arr` by appending elements from the sorted array `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start. This means that the largest and smallest elements are placed alternately in the new array.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The function calculates the beauty of the new array `new_arr` by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
     - After sorting, `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - The new array `new_arr` is constructed as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
     - The beauty is calculated as:
       \[
       (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
       \]
   - The original assessment suggests that the maximum beauty can also be achieved with the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, both of which also give a beauty of 6.

5. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The strategy of placing the largest and smallest elements alternately in the new array ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest possible difference is between the largest and smallest elements, and by alternating, we ensure that these differences are used as much as possible.
   - For any sorted array `arr`, the mirrored order construction will always maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program's strategy of sorting the array and then constructing a new array by alternating the largest and smallest elements does indeed maximize the beauty of the array for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
