Output State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `left` will increment by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n`.
- The variable `right` will decrement by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `-1`.
- The list `new_arr` will contain all elements from `arr`, but in a specific order. If `left` is not equal to `right`, the loop appends the element at the `right` index followed by the element at the `left` index. If `left` equals `right`, it appends the single element at that index. This results in `new_arr` having a mirrored order of elements from `arr`, starting from the end and alternating with the start. For example, if `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `new_arr` will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. If `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `new_arr` will be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
