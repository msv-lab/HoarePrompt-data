To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given loop and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start.
- `max_beauty` is `0`

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, which means it will iterate `n-1` times.
2. **Update of `max_beauty`**: In each iteration, `max_beauty` is incremented by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i-1]`.

### Understanding `new_arr`:
- `new_arr` is constructed by mirroring `arr` and alternating elements from the end and the start.
- For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `new_arr` would be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example with `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- `new_arr = [4, 1, 3, 2]`
- `n = 4`

#### Iteration 1:
- `i = 1`
- `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`
- `max_beauty += abs(1 - 4) = 3`
- `max_beauty = 3`

#### Iteration 2:
- `i = 2`
- `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`
- `max_beauty += abs(3 - 1) = 2`
- `max_beauty = 5`

#### Iteration 3:
- `i = 3`
- `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`
- `max_beauty += abs(2 - 3) = 1`
- `max_beauty = 6`

### General Case:
- The loop will iterate `n-1` times, and in each iteration, it will add the absolute difference between consecutive elements of `new_arr` to `max_beauty`.
- The final value of `max_beauty` will be the sum of these absolute differences.

### Output State:
- `left` remains `n`
- `right` remains `-1`
- `new_arr` remains the same as it was initially constructed.
- `max_beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.

Output State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is the same as initially constructed, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.**
