Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The provided program attempts to achieve this by sorting the array and then constructing a new array in a mirrored order, which should ideally place the largest and smallest elements next to each other, thereby maximizing the differences.

However, the program calculates the sum of the **absolute** differences between consecutive elements, which is not the same as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). The problem specifically asks for the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), not the absolute differences. This means that the program is solving a different problem than the one described.

For example, consider the array \([1, 2, 3]\):
- The correct beauty should be \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\).
- The program, however, would calculate the absolute differences: \(|2 - 1| + |3 - 2| = 1 + 1 = 2\), which happens to be correct in this case but is not the intended calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should not use the absolute differences but rather the direct differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).

Given this, the program is incorrect for the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
