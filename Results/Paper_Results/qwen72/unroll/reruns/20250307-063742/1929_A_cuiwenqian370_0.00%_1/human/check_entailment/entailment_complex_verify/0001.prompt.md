You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

    return max_beauty

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9.

    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])

    #State: `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is the same as initially constructed, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start. The function then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr` and returns this sum. After the function concludes, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the described mirrored order, and the program returns the computed sum of absolute differences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- **Constraints**: 
  - \(1 \le t \le 500\) (number of test cases)
  - \(2 \le n \le 100\) (length of the array)
  - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) (elements of the array)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the maximum beauty of the array.
   - **Sorting the Array**:
     - The array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Creating a New Array**:
     - The program creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the sorted array `arr` from the ends towards the center.
     - If the length of the array is odd, the middle element is added last.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is a good starting point because it allows us to consider the elements in a structured manner.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), which can be positive or negative. The absolute differences are not directly relevant to the problem statement.

2. **Creating a New Array**:
   - The program creates `new_arr` by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - For example, if the sorted array is \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\), the new array will be \([5, 1, 4, 2, 3]\).
   - This approach ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, which can maximize the differences.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Since the array is rearranged to have large and small elements alternating, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:
     - **Test Case 1**: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\)
       - Sorted: \([1, 2, 3]\)
       - New array: \([3, 1, 2]\)
       - Beauty: \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3\)
       - **Expected**: 2 (The correct approach should be \([1, 3, 2]\) which gives \((3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1\))
     - **Test Case 2**: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
       - Sorted: \([69, 69, 69]\)
       - New array: \([69, 69, 69]\)
       - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
       - **Expected**: 0 (Correct)
     - **Test Case 3**: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
       - Sorted: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
       - New array: \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\)
       - Beauty: \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 100) = 57 + 36 - 26 - 20 = 47\)
       - **Expected**: 57 (The correct approach should be \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\) which gives \((100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 46 + 36 - 10 = 37\))
     - **Test Case 4**: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\)
       - Sorted: \([3, 3, 3, 4]\)
       - New array: \([4, 3, 3, 3]\)
       - Beauty: \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\)
       - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)
     - **Test Case 5**: \(a = [2, 1]\)
       - Sorted: \([1, 2]\)
       - New array: \([2, 1]\)
       - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
       - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
- The program's approach of alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array does not always maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem.
- The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) without rearranging the elements in a specific pattern.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly.
