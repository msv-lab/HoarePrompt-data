The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr[i]` satisfies 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `arr`.**
