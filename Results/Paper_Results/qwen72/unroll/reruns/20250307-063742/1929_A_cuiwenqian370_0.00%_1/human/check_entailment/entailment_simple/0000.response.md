### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to rearrange the elements of the array `a` to maximize the beauty, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program sorts the array and then constructs a new array in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good starting point because it allows us to consider the largest and smallest elements in a structured way.

2. **Constructing the New Array**: The program constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. The idea is to place the largest and smallest elements next to each other to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program then calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is done in the loop where `max_beauty` is updated.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array is a necessary step because it allows us to easily access the largest and smallest elements.
- **Mirrored Order**: By alternating between the largest and smallest elements, the program ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest element will be followed by the smallest, and so on, which maximizes the absolute differences.
- **Absolute Differences**: The program correctly calculates the beauty using the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Potential Issues:

- **Absolute Differences vs. Simple Differences**: The problem statement defines the beauty as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), not the absolute differences. However, the program calculates the absolute differences, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the simple differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value.

### Corrected Program:

To correct the program, we need to change the calculation of `max_beauty` to use simple differences instead of absolute differences.

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1]
    
    return max_beauty
```

### Conclusion:

The original program calculates the absolute differences, which is not what the problem statement requires. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
