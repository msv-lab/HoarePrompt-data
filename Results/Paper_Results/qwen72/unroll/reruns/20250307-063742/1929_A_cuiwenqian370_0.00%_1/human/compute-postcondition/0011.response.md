Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start. The function then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr` and returns this sum. After the function concludes, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the described mirrored order, and the program returns the computed sum of absolute differences. **
