Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program's approach. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), not the sum of the absolute differences. The program's approach of alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array does not always achieve the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the annotations and the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the length of the array \(n\) and its elements for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting the Array**:
     - The array is sorted in ascending order, which is a valid step.
   - **Creating a New Array**:
     - The program creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, but it does so using absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. This is incorrect because the problem requires the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), not the absolute differences.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\)
     - Sorted: \([1, 2, 3]\)
     - New array: \([3, 1, 2]\)
     - Beauty: \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3\)
     - **Expected**: 2 (The correct approach should be \([1, 3, 2]\) which gives \((3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1\))
   - **Test Case 2**: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
     - Sorted: \([69, 69, 69]\)
     - New array: \([69, 69, 69]\)
     - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - **Expected**: 0 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3**: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
     - Sorted: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
     - New array: \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\)
     - Beauty: \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 100) = 57 + 36 - 26 - 20 = 47\)
     - **Expected**: 57 (The correct approach should be \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\) which gives \((100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 46 + 36 - 10 = 37\))
   - **Test Case 4**: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\)
     - Sorted: \([3, 3, 3, 4]\)
     - New array: \([4, 3, 3, 3]\)
     - Beauty: \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\)
     - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5**: \(a = [2, 1]\)
     - Sorted: \([1, 2]\)
     - New array: \([2, 1]\)
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
     - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, the correct approach is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) directly. This ensures that the differences are maximized in the correct order.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
