Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9.** 

The list `arr` has been sorted in ascending order, while the value of `n` remains unchanged. Each element in `arr` is now in a non-decreasing order, meaning that for any index `i` (0 <= i < n-1), `arr[i]` <= `arr[i+1]`.
