Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect. The program actually does compute the maximum beauty of the array correctly for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program starts by sorting the array `arr`. This step ensures that the smallest and largest elements are at the ends of the sorted array.

2. **Rearranging the Array**: The program then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end (`right`) and the beginning (`left`) of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` are maximized.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. Since the elements are alternated from the largest and smallest values, this method ensures that the differences are as large as possible.

Let's analyze the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**: `1 2 3 4`
- **Sorted Array**: `1 2 3 4`
- **Rearranged Array**: `[4, 1, 3, 2]`
- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

This is indeed the maximum beauty for this array. The original assessment incorrectly states that the beauty for the rearrangement `[1, 4, 3, 2]` is 3, but the correct calculation for this rearrangement is:
- `(4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`

However, the correct maximum beauty for this case is 6, which the program correctly computes.

The program's approach of alternating elements from the sorted array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. This approach works for all valid inputs within the constraints provided.

Final: **True**
