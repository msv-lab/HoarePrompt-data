Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` does indeed produce the maximum beauty for the given problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function starts by sorting the array `arr`. This is a crucial step because it allows us to work with the elements in a predictable order.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**: The function then constructs a new array `new_arr` by appending elements from the sorted `arr` in a mirrored order. Specifically, it alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The function calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Let's analyze why this approach works:

- **Maximizing Differences**: By alternating between the largest and smallest elements, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible. This is because the largest possible difference between any two elements in a sorted array is between the largest and smallest elements.

- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles the case where `left == right` correctly by appending the middle element only once. This ensures that all elements are included in `new_arr`.

- **Consistency**: The approach is consistent and will always produce the maximum beauty for any input array. This is because the largest and smallest elements are always chosen first, and this pattern continues until all elements are used.

Let's verify the function with the provided test cases:

### Test Case 1
```
Input:
3
2 1 3
```
- Sorted `arr`: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Constructed `new_arr`: `[3, 1, 2]`
- Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3`

### Test Case 2
```
Input:
3
69 69 69
```
- Sorted `arr`: `[69, 69, 69]`
- Constructed `new_arr`: `[69, 69, 69]`
- Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

### Test Case 3
```
Input:
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
- Sorted `arr`: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Constructed `new_arr`: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
- Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166`

### Test Case 4
```
Input:
4
3 4 3 3
```
- Sorted `arr`: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
- Constructed `new_arr`: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
- Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

### Test Case 5
```
Input:
2
2 1
```
- Sorted `arr`: `[1, 2]`
- Constructed `new_arr`: `[2, 1]`
- Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

In all these cases, the function `func_1` produces the correct maximum beauty. The original assessment's example of `[1, 4, 3, 2]` is incorrect because the maximum beauty for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is indeed 6, which is achieved by the program's output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
