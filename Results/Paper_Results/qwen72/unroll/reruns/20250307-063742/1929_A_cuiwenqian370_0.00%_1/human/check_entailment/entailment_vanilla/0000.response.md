Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- **Constraints**: 
  - \(1 \le t \le 500\) (number of test cases)
  - \(2 \le n \le 100\) (length of the array)
  - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) (elements of the array)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the maximum beauty of the array.
   - **Sorting the Array**:
     - The array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Creating a New Array**:
     - The program creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the sorted array `arr` from the ends towards the center.
     - If the length of the array is odd, the middle element is added last.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is a good starting point because it allows us to consider the elements in a structured manner.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), which can be positive or negative. The absolute differences are not directly relevant to the problem statement.

2. **Creating a New Array**:
   - The program creates `new_arr` by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - For example, if the sorted array is \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\), the new array will be \([5, 1, 4, 2, 3]\).
   - This approach ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, which can maximize the differences.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Since the array is rearranged to have large and small elements alternating, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:
     - **Test Case 1**: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\)
       - Sorted: \([1, 2, 3]\)
       - New array: \([3, 1, 2]\)
       - Beauty: \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3\)
       - **Expected**: 2 (The correct approach should be \([1, 3, 2]\) which gives \((3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1\))
     - **Test Case 2**: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
       - Sorted: \([69, 69, 69]\)
       - New array: \([69, 69, 69]\)
       - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
       - **Expected**: 0 (Correct)
     - **Test Case 3**: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
       - Sorted: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
       - New array: \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\)
       - Beauty: \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 100) = 57 + 36 - 26 - 20 = 47\)
       - **Expected**: 57 (The correct approach should be \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\) which gives \((100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 46 + 36 - 10 = 37\))
     - **Test Case 4**: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\)
       - Sorted: \([3, 3, 3, 4]\)
       - New array: \([4, 3, 3, 3]\)
       - Beauty: \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\)
       - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)
     - **Test Case 5**: \(a = [2, 1]\)
       - Sorted: \([1, 2]\)
       - New array: \([2, 1]\)
       - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
       - **Expected**: 1 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
- The program's approach of alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array does not always maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem.
- The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) without rearranging the elements in a specific pattern.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly.
