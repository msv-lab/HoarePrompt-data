The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and alternating with the start, `max_beauty` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
