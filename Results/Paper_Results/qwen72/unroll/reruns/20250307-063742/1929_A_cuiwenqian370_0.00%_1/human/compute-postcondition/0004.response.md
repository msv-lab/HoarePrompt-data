The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The loop condition is `left <= right`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. 

- `left` is 0, which is the smallest possible value.
- `right` is `n - 1`, where `n` is at least 2 (since 2 <= n <= 100).

Since `n` is at least 2, `right` will be at least 1. Therefore, `left` (which is 0) is always less than or equal to `right` (which is at least 1) in the first iteration. No adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
