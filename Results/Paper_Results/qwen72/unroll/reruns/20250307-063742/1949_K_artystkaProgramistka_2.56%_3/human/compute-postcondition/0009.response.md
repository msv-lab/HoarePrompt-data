The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`. `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, representing the sizes of three groups. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns:
- **Case 1**: If it is possible to partition the list `numbers` into three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that `group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, and `group_c` contains `nc` numbers, and the sums of the numbers in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`, the function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- **Case 2**: If it is not possible to partition the list `numbers` in such a way, the function returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`, where `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the list can be partitioned into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, and the sums of these groups satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`. If such a partition is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
