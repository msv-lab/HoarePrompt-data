The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `numbers` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element in the list.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all 0, `num` is the first element in the list `numbers`**
