The `numbers` list is sorted in descending order, meaning the largest elements come first and the smallest elements come last. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9.**
