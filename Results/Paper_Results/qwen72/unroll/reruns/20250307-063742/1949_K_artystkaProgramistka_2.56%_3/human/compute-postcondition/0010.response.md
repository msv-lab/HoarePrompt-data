Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`, where `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list `numbers` in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. The function calculates the sums of the numbers in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`). If the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true, the function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'. The original list `numbers` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, but it is sorted in descending order within the function. **
