Output State: **The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains `na` numbers from the list `numbers`, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers from the list `numbers`, and `group_c` contains `nc` numbers from the list `numbers`. The sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` respectively, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
