Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

The initial state variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the list `numbers` also remains unchanged. The code initializes three new empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
