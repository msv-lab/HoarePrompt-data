Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `na` remains the same, `nb` remains the same, `nc` remains the same, `numbers` remains the same, `group_a` contains `na` numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers from `numbers`, `group_c` contains `nc` numbers from `numbers`, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `False`.***
