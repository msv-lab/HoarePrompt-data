Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Lambda Function for Input**: The use of a lambda function for reading input is not a standard or recommended practice. It can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

2. **Tuple Unpacking for Single Integer**: The line `(t,) = r()` is unnecessarily complex. It can be simplified to `t = int(input())`.

3. **Incorrect Initialization of `a`**: The list `a` is initialized with `(-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)`. This adds two extra elements at the beginning and end of the list, which are not necessary and can cause issues in the logic.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of `b`**: The list `b` is being populated in a way that does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to travel to the closest city. The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` are not appropriate for this problem. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city.

5. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The query handling logic is flawed. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another. It should consider the cost of traveling to the closest city and the direct distance cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = int(input())
        
        # Precompute the closest city for each city
        closest = [0] * n
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i+1] - a[i] <= a[i] - a[i-1]:
                closest[i] = i + 1
            else:
                closest[i] = i - 1
        closest[0] = 1
        closest[-1] = n - 2
        
        # Precompute the minimum cost to travel to each city
        cost = [0] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            cost[i] = min(cost[i-1] + abs(a[i] - a[i-1]), 1 + cost[closest[i-1]])
        
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if x > y:
                x, y = y, x
            print(cost[y-1] - cost[x-1])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The input is read in a more straightforward manner.
2. **Closest City Calculation**: The `closest` list is precomputed to store the index of the closest city for each city.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The `cost` list is precomputed to store the minimum cost to travel to each city from the first city. This is done using dynamic programming, considering both the direct distance and the cost of traveling to the closest city.
4. **Query Handling**: For each query, the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` is calculated by subtracting the cost to reach city `x` from the cost to reach city `y`.

This corrected program should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
