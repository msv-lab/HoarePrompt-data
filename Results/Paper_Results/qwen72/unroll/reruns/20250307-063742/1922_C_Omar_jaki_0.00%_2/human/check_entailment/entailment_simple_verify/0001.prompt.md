You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

The values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each query are unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Format**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities `a`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - Each query consists of two cities `x` and `y`, and the goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `x` to city `y`.

2. **Closest City**:
   - For each city `i`, the closest city `j` is the city such that the distance between `i` and `j` is not greater than the distance between `i` and any other city `k`.
   - The closest city is unique for each city.

3. **Travel Costs**:
   - Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.
   - Traveling to any other city costs the absolute difference in their coordinates.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program uses a lambda function `r` to read and map input to integers.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the coordinates of the cities `a`.
   - It pads the list `a` with `-1000000000.0` at the beginning and `2000000000.0` at the end. This padding is to handle edge cases where the closest city might be the first or last city.
   - It initializes a list `b` with two zeros.

3. **Calculating Minimum Costs**:
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the minimum cost to travel to each city from the previous city.
   - It uses the `zip` function to iterate over four consecutive elements of the padded list `a` (denoted as `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`).
   - For each city `x`, it calculates the distance to the next city `y` and updates the list `b` with the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city.

4. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program reads the number of queries `u` for the current test case.
   - For each query, it reads the cities `c` and `d`.
   - If `c < d`, it prints the difference in cumulative costs from city `c` to city `d`.
   - If `c > d`, it prints the difference in cumulative costs from city `d` to city `c`.

### Issues and Considerations:
1. **Padding**:
   - The padding with `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` is intended to handle edge cases, but it might introduce floating-point precision issues. However, since the problem guarantees that the closest city is unique, this should not affect the correctness.

2. **Cumulative Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative cost using the formula `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`. This is a bit unconventional but works because `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` are effectively 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise.
   - The cumulative cost is stored in the list `b`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by calculating the difference in cumulative costs.
   - The logic for determining the direction of travel (from `c` to `d` or from `d` to `c`) is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on the given problem description. The use of padding and the unconventional way of calculating the cumulative cost might be a bit unusual, but they do not affect the correctness of the solution.
