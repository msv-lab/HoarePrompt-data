For the given `while` loop to execute at least once, the condition `t` must evaluate to a truthy value. In the context of Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy. Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is already within a range that ensures it is non-zero and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
