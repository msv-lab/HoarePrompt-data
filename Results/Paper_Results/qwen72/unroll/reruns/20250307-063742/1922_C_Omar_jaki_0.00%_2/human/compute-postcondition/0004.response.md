The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing a strictly increasing sequence of integers.
- `m`: an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: a list of `m` pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the indices of elements in the list `a` to be queried.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the difference between the elements at the indices specified by the query (a[y_i] - a[x_i]).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries`. It processes `t` test cases, each with a list `a` of `n` strictly increasing integers and `m` queries. For each query, it returns the difference between the elements at the specified indices in the list `a`.**
