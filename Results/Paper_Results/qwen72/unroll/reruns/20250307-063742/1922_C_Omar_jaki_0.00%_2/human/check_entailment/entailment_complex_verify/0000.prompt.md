You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `a` is the modified list with -1000000000.0 and 2000000000.0 added at the beginning and end respectively, `m` is unchanged, `b` is a list of integers representing the cumulative counts of certain conditions met during the loop, and `u` is 0 for each test case. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each query are unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of strictly increasing integers and a set of queries. It calculates and prints the cumulative counts of certain conditions based on the differences between adjacent elements in the list. For each query, it prints the difference between the cumulative counts at the specified indices. The function modifies the input list `a` by adding `-1000000000.0` at the beginning and `2000000000.0` at the end, and it generates a list `b` that represents these cumulative counts. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 0, `a` modified, and `b` populated with the cumulative counts. The input variables `n`, `m`, and the query indices remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are not evenly spaced, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic for calculating the closest city's cost is flawed. The program uses the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` to determine the cost, which is not a valid way to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city. The cost should be 1 if traveling to the closest city, and the actual distance if traveling to any other city.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  0 8 12 15 20
  5
  1 4
  1 5
  3 4
  3 2
  5 1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  8
  1
  4
  14
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will produce incorrect results because the cost calculation for the closest city is not handled correctly. The use of `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is not a valid way to determine the cost, and it will not always return the correct minimum number of coins.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the closest city and use a cost of 1 for traveling to it, and the actual distance for traveling to any other city.
