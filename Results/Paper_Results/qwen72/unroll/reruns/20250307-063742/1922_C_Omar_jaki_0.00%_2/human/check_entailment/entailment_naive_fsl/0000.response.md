Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are not evenly spaced, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic for calculating the closest city's cost is flawed. The program uses the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` to determine the cost, which is not a valid way to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city. The cost should be 1 if traveling to the closest city, and the actual distance if traveling to any other city.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  0 8 12 15 20
  5
  1 4
  1 5
  3 4
  3 2
  5 1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  8
  1
  4
  14
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will produce incorrect results because the cost calculation for the closest city is not handled correctly. The use of `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is not a valid way to determine the cost, and it will not always return the correct minimum number of coins.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the closest city and use a cost of 1 for traveling to it, and the actual distance for traveling to any other city.
