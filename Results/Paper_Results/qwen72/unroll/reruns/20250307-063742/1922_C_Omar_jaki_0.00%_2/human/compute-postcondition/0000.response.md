The code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input values to integers and returns an iterator of these integers. The function `r` itself does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`, as it only defines a function and does not execute it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function `r` is defined to map input values to integers.**
