You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `a` is the modified list with -1000000000.0 and 2000000000.0 added at the beginning and end respectively, `m` is unchanged, `b` is a list of integers representing the cumulative counts of certain conditions met during the loop, and `u` is 0 for each test case. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each query are unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries`. It processes `t` test cases, each with a list `a` of `n` strictly increasing integers and `m` queries. For each query, it returns the difference between the elements at the specified indices in the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
