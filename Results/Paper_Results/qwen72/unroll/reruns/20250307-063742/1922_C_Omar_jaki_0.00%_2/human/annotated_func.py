#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `a` is the modified list with -1000000000.0 and 2000000000.0 added at the beginning and end respectively, `m` is unchanged, `b` is a list of integers representing the cumulative counts of certain conditions met during the loop, and `u` is 0 for each test case. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each query are unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of strictly increasing integers and a set of queries. It calculates and prints the cumulative counts of certain conditions based on the differences between adjacent elements in the list. For each query, it prints the difference between the cumulative counts at the specified indices. The function modifies the input list `a` by adding `-1000000000.0` at the beginning and `2000000000.0` at the end, and it generates a list `b` that represents these cumulative counts. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 0, `a` modified, and `b` populated with the cumulative counts. The input variables `n`, `m`, and the query indices remain unchanged.
