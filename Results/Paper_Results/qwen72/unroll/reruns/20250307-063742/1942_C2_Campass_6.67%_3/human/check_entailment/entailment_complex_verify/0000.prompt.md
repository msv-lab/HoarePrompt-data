You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop will print the value of `cons` for each test case, where `cons` represents the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to the existing configuration. The value of `t` will be 0 after all iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case. It does not return any value. The function expects the first input to be an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects four inputs: an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, an integer `y` representing the number of additional vertices that can be added, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calculates and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the existing configuration. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not contiguous or where the chosen vertices do not form a simple path. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the number of triangles that can be formed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7. The program will incorrectly calculate the number of triangles because it assumes that the chosen vertices form a contiguous path, which they do not. The correct output should be 4, but the program will output a different value.

The logic in the program is based on the assumption that the vertices chosen by Bessie form a simple path, which is not always the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
