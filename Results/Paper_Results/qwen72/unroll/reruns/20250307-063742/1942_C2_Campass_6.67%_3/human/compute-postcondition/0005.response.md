Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case. It does not return any value. The function expects the first input to be an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects four inputs: an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, an integer `y` representing the number of additional vertices that can be added, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calculates and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the existing configuration. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0. **
