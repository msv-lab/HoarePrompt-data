You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - \( t \): Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - \( n \): Number of sides of the polygon.
     - \( x \): Number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
     - \( y \): Maximum number of additional vertices you can choose.
     - \( l \): List of \( x \) distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `R` is defined to read a list of integers from the input.
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) are read.
   - The list of chosen vertices \( l \) is read, sorted, and the first vertex is appended to the end of the list to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

2. **Calculating Initial Triangles:**
   - `sx` is initialized to 0, which will store the count of initial triangles.
   - For each pair of consecutive chosen vertices in the sorted list \( l \), the number of vertices between them is calculated as `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`.
   - If `c == 1`, it means there is exactly one vertex between the chosen vertices, which can form a triangle with the two chosen vertices. Hence, `sx` is incremented by 1.
   - The value `c` is appended to the list `val`.

3. **Optimizing Additional Triangles:**
   - The list `val` is sorted based on a custom key: first by whether the value is even or odd (1 - (x & 1)), and then by the value itself.
   - This sorting ensures that we prioritize adding vertices to form triangles in the smallest gaps first, which is a good strategy to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each value in `val`, the number of additional vertices that can be added to form triangles is calculated as `c = i // 2`.
   - If the number of additional vertices \( y \) is less than `c`, we add \( 2 \times y \) to `sx` and break the loop.
   - Otherwise, we add `i` to `sx` and decrement \( y \) by `c`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of triangles `cons` is calculated as \( x + sx - 2 \).
   - This formula accounts for the initial chosen vertices and the additional triangles formed by the vertices added.
   - `cons` is then clamped to the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with \( n \) sides, which is \( n - 2 \).

### Verification:
- The program correctly reads and processes the input.
- The initial triangle count is calculated correctly by checking the gaps between chosen vertices.
- The additional vertices are added in a way that maximizes the number of triangles, which is a valid approach.
- The final calculation ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible for the given polygon.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
