### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are sorted and the first vertex plus `n` is appended to the list. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon by treating the last vertex as the first vertex in a new cycle.

3. **Calculating Initial Triangles:**
   - The function initializes `sx` to 0, which will be used to count the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices. If a gap is exactly 1, it increments `sx` by 1, indicating a triangle can be formed by the two consecutive vertices and the next vertex in the list.

4. **Handling Additional Vertices:**
   - The gaps are stored in the list `val` and sorted based on a custom key. The key sorts gaps by their parity (odd or even) and then by their size.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to add vertices to form more triangles. If the number of additional vertices `y` is less than the required number of vertices to fill the gap, it adds the maximum possible number of triangles using the available vertices. Otherwise, it adds the full number of triangles that can be formed by the gap and reduces `y` accordingly.

5. **Calculating and Printing the Result:**
   - The total number of triangles `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which accounts for the initial triangles and the additional triangles formed.
   - The result is clamped to `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for calculating the gaps and forming triangles is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The use of sorting and the custom key ensures that the function efficiently adds vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
- The final result is correctly clamped to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
