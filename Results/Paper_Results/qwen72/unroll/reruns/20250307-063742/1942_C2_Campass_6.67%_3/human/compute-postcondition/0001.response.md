Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `R` is a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers. The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the first integer from the input split by spaces.**
