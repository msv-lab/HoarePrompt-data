The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `R` which, when called, splits the input based on spaces and maps each split part to an integer. This function does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state directly. However, it prepares a way to read and process input data in the form of integers.

Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `R` is a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers.**
