Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not contiguous or where the chosen vertices do not form a simple path. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the number of triangles that can be formed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7. The program will incorrectly calculate the number of triangles because it assumes that the chosen vertices form a contiguous path, which they do not. The correct output should be 4, but the program will output a different value.

The logic in the program is based on the assumption that the vertices chosen by Bessie form a simple path, which is not always the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
