Output State: **The loop will print the value of `cons` for each test case, where `cons` represents the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to the existing configuration. The value of `t` will be 0 after all iterations are completed.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, the loop processes a test case defined by `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers.
- The loop calculates the maximum number of triangles (`cons`) that can be formed by adding vertices to the existing configuration.
- After processing each test case, the loop prints the value of `cons`.
- After all iterations are completed, the value of `t` will be 0, as `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
