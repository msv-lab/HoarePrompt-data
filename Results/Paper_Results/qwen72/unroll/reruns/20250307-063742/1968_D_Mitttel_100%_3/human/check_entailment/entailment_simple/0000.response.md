### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices of the starting positions and the permutation to be 0-based, which is a common practice in Python.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score encountered.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It creates a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`vis[s]` is 0) and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to be the maximum of the current `mx` and the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - It adds the score of the current position to the current score (`cur += a[s]`).
     - It decrements the number of turns left (`k -= 1`).
     - It moves the player to the next position in the permutation (`s = p[s]`).

4. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both players, the program compares their scores and prints the appropriate result.

### Issues:
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation inside the loop (`mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`) is incorrect. This formula assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining turns, which is not always the optimal strategy. The correct approach should be to calculate the score for each turn and keep track of the maximum score encountered.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or the current position `s` has been visited. This is correct because it prevents infinite loops and ensures that the game is played for exactly `k` turns.

- **Final Score:**
  - The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum score encountered during the loop. However, this does not necessarily represent the final score of the player after `k` turns. The final score should be the value of `cur` after the loop completes.

### Corrected Function:
To fix the issues, the function should calculate the score for each turn and return the final score after `k` turns.

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    cur = 0
    vis = [0] * n
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return cur
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the final score of each player. The score calculation inside the loop is flawed, and the function should return the final score after `k` turns, not the maximum score encountered.

Correctness: **False**
