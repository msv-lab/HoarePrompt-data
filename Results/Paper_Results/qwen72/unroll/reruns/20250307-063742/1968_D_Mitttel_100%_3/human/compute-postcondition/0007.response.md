The function `func_1` accepts four parameters:
- `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element `a_i` in `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.
- `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game.

The function returns the maximum value encountered during the execution of the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: two lists of integers `a` and `p` of the same length, a list `s` of two integers representing starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of turns. It returns the maximum value encountered during the game.**
