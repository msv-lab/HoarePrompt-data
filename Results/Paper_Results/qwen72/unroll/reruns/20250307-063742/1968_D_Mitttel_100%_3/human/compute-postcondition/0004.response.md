To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - The state right before the loop indicates that `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.

2. **Condition `not vis[s]`:**
   - The state right before the loop indicates that `vis` is a list of `n` zeros. This means that initially, all elements in `vis` are 0.
   - The variable `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - For the loop to execute, `vis[s]` must be `False` (i.e., `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` must both be 0).

Given that `vis` is initially a list of zeros, `vis[s]` will be `False` as long as `s[0]` and `s[1]` are valid indices within the range of the list `vis`.

Since the initial state already satisfies both conditions (`k > 0` and `vis[s]` being `False`), no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is the length of the list `p`, `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and `p` is a permutation. `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
