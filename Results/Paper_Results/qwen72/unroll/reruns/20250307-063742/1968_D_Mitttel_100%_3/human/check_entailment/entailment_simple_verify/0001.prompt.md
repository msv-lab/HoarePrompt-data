You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
     - The second line contains the permutation \( p \).
     - The third line contains the array \( a \).

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Each player starts at a position in the permutation.
   - On each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in array \( a \).
   - The player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation \( p \).
   - The game lasts for \( k \) turns.
   - The player with the higher score after \( k \) turns wins. If both have the same score, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) and playing for \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop continues as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and \( k \) is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position \( s \) as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.
     - It adds the value at the current position \( a[s] \) to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements \( k \) by 1.
     - It moves to the next position \( p[s] \).

4. **Comparing Scores:**
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their maximum possible scores.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program subtracts 1 from each element of \( p \) and \( a \), which is correct for converting 1-based to 0-based indexing. However, the problem description does not require modifying \( a \). Only \( p \) should be adjusted.

2. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to prevent infinite loops, which is a good approach since permutations can form cycles.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score correctly by considering the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the adjustment of the array \( a \). The array \( a \) should not be adjusted by subtracting 1 from each element. This adjustment is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect scores if the values in \( a \) are not 1-based.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary adjustment of the array \( a \). This adjustment should be removed to ensure the scores are calculated correctly.
