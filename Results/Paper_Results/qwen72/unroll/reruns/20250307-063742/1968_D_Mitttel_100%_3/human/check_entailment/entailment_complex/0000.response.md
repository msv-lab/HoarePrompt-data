### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It adjusts the starting positions `pb` and `ps` by subtracting 1 to align with 0-indexed arrays.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score encountered.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current cumulative score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions.

3. **Game Simulation Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`. This step is intended to account for the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 (all turns are used) or `vis[s]` becomes 1 (a position is revisited).
   - The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum score encountered during the game.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The main program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions.
   - It compares the scores and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `a` and `p`:**
  - The program incorrectly adjusts the elements of `a` and `p` by subtracting 1. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect scores and positions.
  - The correct adjustment should only be applied to the starting positions `pb` and `ps`.

- **Incorrect Use of `vis` List:**
  - The `vis` list is initialized with `[(0) for _ in range(n)]`, which is not necessary. A simple list of zeros would suffice: `vis = [0] * n`.

- **Incorrect Calculation of `mx`:**
  - The calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is not correct. The player's score should be the cumulative sum of the scores at each position visited, not a potential future score based on remaining turns.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    vis = [0] * n
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        score += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return score
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program remains as is, due to the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
