Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
     - The second line contains the permutation \( p \).
     - The third line contains the array \( a \).

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Each player starts at a position in the permutation.
   - On each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in array \( a \).
   - The player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation \( p \).
   - The game lasts for \( k \) turns.
   - The player with the higher score after \( k \) turns wins. If both have the same score, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) and playing for \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop continues as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and \( k \) is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position \( s \) as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.
     - It adds the value at the current position \( a[s] \) to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements \( k \) by 1.
     - It moves to the next position \( p[s] \).

4. **Comparing Scores:**
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their maximum possible scores.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program subtracts 1 from each element of \( p \) and \( a \), which is correct for converting 1-based to 0-based indexing. However, the problem description does not require modifying \( a \). Only \( p \) should be adjusted.

2. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to prevent infinite loops, which is a good approach since permutations can form cycles.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score correctly by considering the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the adjustment of the array \( a \). The array \( a \) should not be adjusted by subtracting 1 from each element. This adjustment is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect scores if the values in \( a \) are not 1-based.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary adjustment of the array \( a \). This adjustment should be removed to ensure the scores are calculated correctly.
