Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the scores and the moves. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score a player can achieve, but it does not correctly simulate the game as described. The game rules state that a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`. However, the function `func_1` always moves the player to the next position in the permutation, which does not align with the game's rules.

Additionally, the function `func_1` updates the score by adding `k * a[s]` to the current score, which is incorrect. The score should be updated by adding `a[s]` for each turn, not `k * a[s]`.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output:
```
Sasha
```

In this test case, Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. The permutation `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`.

- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya is at position 3, score increases by `a[3] = 6`, new score is 6.
  - Bodya moves to `p[3] = 3`, so he stays at position 3.
  - Sasha is at position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`, new score is 5.
  - Sasha moves to `p[2] = 2`, so she stays at position 2.

- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya is at position 3, score increases by `a[3] = 6`, new score is 12.
  - Bodya moves to `p[3] = 3`, so he stays at position 3.
  - Sasha is at position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`, new score is 10.
  - Sasha moves to `p[2] = 2`, so she stays at position 2.

After 2 turns, Bodya's score is 12 and Sasha's score is 10, so Bodya wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Sasha" because it does not correctly simulate the game rules.
