Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `p`, `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and `p` is a permutation. `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code initializes a list `vis` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `mx`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
