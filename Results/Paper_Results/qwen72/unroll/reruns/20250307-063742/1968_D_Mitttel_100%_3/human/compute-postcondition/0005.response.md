Output State: **The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1. The final values of `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `vis` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `p`, and the initial positions `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`mx`**: This variable keeps track of the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop. It will be the highest value of this expression before the loop terminates.
- **`cur`**: This variable accumulates the values of `a[s]` as the loop progresses. It will be the sum of the values of `a[s]` at each step until the loop terminates.
- **`k`**: This variable decrements by 1 in each iteration. It will be 0 if the loop runs for `k` iterations without encountering a visited position `s`.
- **`vis`**: This list is used to mark positions in the permutation `p` that have been visited. Once a position `s` is visited, `vis[s]` is set to 1, and the loop will terminate if it encounters this position again.

The loop will stop either because `k` has reached 0 (all turns have been taken) or because `s` has been visited before (indicating a cycle in the permutation `p`). The final values of `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `vis` will reflect the state at the point of termination.
