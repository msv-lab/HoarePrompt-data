a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element in p is a unique integer from 1 to n (inclusive), and each element in a is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). s is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ s[0], s[1] ≤ n). k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game.
