### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Index Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the inputs for each test case.
   - The permutation \( p \) is adjusted to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each element, which is necessary.
   - However, the array \( a \) is also adjusted by subtracting 1 from each element, which is incorrect. The values in \( a \) should remain as they are because they represent the scores at each position, and they are not indices.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) and playing for \( k \) turns.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to prevent infinite loops, which is a good approach given that permutations can form cycles.
   - The loop correctly updates the current score `cur` and the remaining turns `k` while moving to the next position \( p[s] \).
   - The `mx` variable is updated to the maximum of the current maximum score and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns. This is a logical step to ensure the maximum possible score is considered.

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their maximum possible scores.
   - It then compares the scores and prints the result accordingly:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

### Key Points from Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly initializes the necessary variables and uses a loop to simulate the game turns.
- The loop terminates when either the number of turns \( k \) becomes 0 or the current position \( s \) has been visited.
- The final value of `mx` is returned, which represents the maximum score a player can achieve from the starting position \( s \) within \( k \) turns.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the adjustment of the array \( a \). The program should not subtract 1 from the elements of \( a \) because they represent the scores at each position, not indices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Final Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary adjustment of the array \( a \). This adjustment should be removed to ensure the scores are calculated correctly.

Final: **False**
