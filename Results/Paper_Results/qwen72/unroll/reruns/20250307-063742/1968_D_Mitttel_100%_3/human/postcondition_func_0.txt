The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` and `p` (lists of integers of the same length `n`), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of turns). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the game, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` accessed through the permutation `p`, and `k` is decremented with each turn. The game ends when either all `k` turns are used or a position in `s` is revisited.
