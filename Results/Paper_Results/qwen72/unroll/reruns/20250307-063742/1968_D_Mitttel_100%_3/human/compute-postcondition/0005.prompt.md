Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the length of the list `p`, `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and `p` is a permutation. `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
