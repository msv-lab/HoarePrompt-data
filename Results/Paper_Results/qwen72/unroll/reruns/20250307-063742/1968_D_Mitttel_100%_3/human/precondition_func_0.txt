a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and p is a permutation. s is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game.
