Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Incorrect Adjustment of `a` Array:**
   - The program incorrectly adjusts the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element. This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect because the `a` array does not need to be adjusted in this way. The `a` array represents the scores, which should remain as they are.

2. **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to simulate the game for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns. However, the way it handles the cycle detection and score calculation is flawed. Specifically, the line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not necessarily true. The player can move to `p[s]` and continue the game.

3. **Cycle Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If a player enters a cycle, the score should be calculated based on the sum of the cycle and the number of complete cycles that can fit into the remaining turns. The current implementation does not account for this.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly handle the game, you need to:
     - Identify if the player enters a cycle.
     - Calculate the score for the initial part of the game before entering the cycle.
     - Calculate the score for the complete cycles.
     - Calculate the score for the remaining part of the game after the complete cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cycle_sum = 0
    cycle_len = 0
    in_cycle = False

    for _ in range(k):
        if vis[s]:
            in_cycle = True
            break
        vis[s] = 1
        score += a[s]
        s = p[s]

    if in_cycle:
        # Calculate the sum and length of the cycle
        cycle_start = s
        while True:
            cycle_sum += a[s]
            cycle_len += 1
            s = p[s]
            if s == cycle_start:
                break

        # Calculate the score for the remaining turns
        remaining_turns = k - (n - cycle_len)
        full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_len
        remaining_turns %= cycle_len

        score += full_cycles * cycle_sum
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            score += a[s]
            s = p[s]

    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-indexed

    bodya_score = simulate_game(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    sasha_score = simulate_game(a, p, ps - 1, k)

    if bodya_score == sasha_score:
        print('Draw')
    elif bodya_score > sasha_score:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycle detection and score calculation, ensuring that the game is simulated correctly for both players.
