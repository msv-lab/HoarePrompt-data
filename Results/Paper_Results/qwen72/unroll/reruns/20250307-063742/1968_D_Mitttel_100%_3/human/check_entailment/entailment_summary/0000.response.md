Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case (n, k, pb, ps), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**: The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `mx` to 0, `cur` to 0, and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
   - **Loop**: The loop continues until either all `k` turns are used or a position is revisited (`vis[s]` is True).
   - **Score Calculation**: Inside the loop, the function updates the maximum score `mx` by comparing the current score `cur + k * a[s]` with the previous maximum score. This is done to ensure that the player maximizes their score by either staying or moving.
   - **Move**: The player's position is updated to `p[s]` and the turn counter `k` is decremented.
   - **Return**: The function returns the maximum score `mx` after the loop ends.

4. **Comparison and Output**: The main loop compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha after the game and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

However, there is a critical issue in the function `func_1`:
- **Score Calculation**: The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect. The score should be calculated based on the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` accessed through the permutation `p`, not by multiplying the current element by the remaining turns `k`.

The correct approach should be to simply accumulate the score for each turn and return the final score after `k` turns or when a cycle is detected.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while k > 0 and not vis[s]:
        vis[s] = 1
        score += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return score
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.

Given the provided execution summary and the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect due to the score calculation issue.

Correctness: **False**
