You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` and `p` (lists of integers of the same length `n`), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of turns). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the game, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` accessed through the permutation `p`, and `k` is decremented with each turn. The game ends when either all `k` turns are used or a position in `s` is revisited.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the scores and the moves. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score a player can achieve, but it does not correctly simulate the game as described. The game rules state that a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`. However, the function `func_1` always moves the player to the next position in the permutation, which does not align with the game's rules.

Additionally, the function `func_1` updates the score by adding `k * a[s]` to the current score, which is incorrect. The score should be updated by adding `a[s]` for each turn, not `k * a[s]`.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output:
```
Sasha
```

In this test case, Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. The permutation `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`.

- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya is at position 3, score increases by `a[3] = 6`, new score is 6.
  - Bodya moves to `p[3] = 3`, so he stays at position 3.
  - Sasha is at position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`, new score is 5.
  - Sasha moves to `p[2] = 2`, so she stays at position 2.

- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya is at position 3, score increases by `a[3] = 6`, new score is 12.
  - Bodya moves to `p[3] = 3`, so he stays at position 3.
  - Sasha is at position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`, new score is 10.
  - Sasha moves to `p[2] = 2`, so she stays at position 2.

After 2 turns, Bodya's score is 12 and Sasha's score is 10, so Bodya wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Sasha" because it does not correctly simulate the game rules.
