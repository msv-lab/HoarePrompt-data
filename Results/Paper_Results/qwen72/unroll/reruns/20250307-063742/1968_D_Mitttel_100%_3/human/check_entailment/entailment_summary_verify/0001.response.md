### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Index Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the input for each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation \( p \) by subtracting 1 from each element to convert it from 1-based to 0-based indexing. This is necessary and correct.
   - However, the program also subtracts 1 from each element of the array \( a \). This is incorrect because the values in \( a \) are not indices and do not need to be adjusted. They are simply the scores at each position.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) and playing for \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop continues as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and \( k \) is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position \( s \) as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.
     - It adds the value at the current position \( a[s] \) to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements \( k \) by 1.
     - It moves to the next position \( p[s] \).

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their maximum possible scores.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program should only adjust the permutation \( p \) and not the array \( a \).

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Final Correctness:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the unnecessary adjustment of the array \( a \). The program is incorrect due to this adjustment.

Final: **False**
