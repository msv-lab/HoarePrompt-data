You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the coordinates of the corners of the square. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the way the program calculates the distance between the points to determine the side length of the square is flawed. It assumes that the second point in the sorted list is adjacent to the first point, which is not always true. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
2 0
0 2
2 2
```

The sorted coordinates will be:
```
(0, 0)
(0, 2)
(2, 0)
(2, 2)
```

The program will calculate the distance between `(0, 0)` and `(0, 2)` (which is 2) and between `(2, 0)` and `(2, 2)` (which is also 2). It then multiplies these distances to get the area, resulting in `4 * 4 = 16`, which is incorrect. The correct area should be `4`.

A correct approach would involve identifying the unique x and y coordinates and calculating the side length of the square based on the differences between these unique coordinates.
