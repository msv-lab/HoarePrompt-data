Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the way the program calculates the distance between the points to determine the side length of the square is flawed. It assumes that the second point in the sorted list is adjacent to the first point, which is not always true. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
2 0
0 2
2 2
```

The sorted coordinates will be:
```
(0, 0)
(0, 2)
(2, 0)
(2, 2)
```

The program will calculate the distance between `(0, 0)` and `(0, 2)` (which is 2) and between `(2, 0)` and `(2, 2)` (which is also 2). It then multiplies these distances to get the area, resulting in `4 * 4 = 16`, which is incorrect. The correct area should be `4`.

A correct approach would involve identifying the unique x and y coordinates and calculating the side length of the square based on the differences between these unique coordinates.
