### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates directly may not always place the adjacent corners in the correct order for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For example, if the coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2), sorting them will result in [(1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)], which is not the correct order for adjacent corners.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first and second sorted coordinates (`p1`) and between the third and fourth sorted coordinates (`p2`). This approach is incorrect because the distances between these pairs of points are not necessarily the side lengths of the square.
   - The correct approach to find the side length of the square is to calculate the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners, since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The area of the square is then the side length squared.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the rounded value of the area. However, since the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes should always be an integer, rounding is unnecessary and may introduce errors.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(x for (x, y) in coord))
        y_coords = sorted(set(y for (x, y) in coord))
        
        # The side length of the square is the difference between the two unique x or y coordinates
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]  # or y_coords[1] - y_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Extracting Unique Coordinates:**
  - We extract the unique x and y coordinates from the list of corners. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, there will be exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.
- **Calculating Side Length:**
  - The side length of the square is the difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- **Calculating Area:**
  - The area is the side length squared, which is an integer and does not require rounding.

This corrected program will correctly compute the area of the square for each test case.
