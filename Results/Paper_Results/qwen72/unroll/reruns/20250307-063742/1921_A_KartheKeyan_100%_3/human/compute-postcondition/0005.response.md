Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (x, y) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates the area of the square and prints the rounded value of this area. After processing all test cases, the variable `n` is 0, and the function has no return value. The state of other variables outside the function remains unchanged. **
