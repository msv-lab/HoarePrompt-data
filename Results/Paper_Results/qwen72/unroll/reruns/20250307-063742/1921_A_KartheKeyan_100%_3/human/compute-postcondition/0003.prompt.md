Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the coordinates of the corners of the square. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The variable `n` is an input integer, and the loop has not been executed yet.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
