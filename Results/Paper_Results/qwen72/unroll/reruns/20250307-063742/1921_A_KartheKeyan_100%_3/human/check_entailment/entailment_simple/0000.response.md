### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined correctly, and it reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, each time handling a new test case.

2. **Coordinate Collection:**
   - Inside the loop, the function collects the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list `coord`.
   - This is done correctly by reading four lines of input, each containing two integers, and appending them as tuples to the `coord` list.

3. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted using the `sorted` function. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the coordinates are in a predictable order, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations.
   - However, the sorting step is not strictly necessary if we are only interested in the side lengths of the square. The side lengths can be determined by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.

4. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The function calculates the side lengths of the square by computing the Euclidean distance between two pairs of adjacent points.
   - Specifically, it calculates `p1` as the squared distance between `coord[1]` and `coord[0]`, and `p2` as the squared distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.
   - The side length of the square should be the same for both pairs of adjacent points, so `p1` and `p2` should be equal. However, the function does not check this, which is a potential issue.

5. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then rounding the result.
   - This is incorrect because the area of a square is simply the side length squared. Since `p1` and `p2` are both the squared side lengths, the correct area should be `p1` or `p2` (they should be equal).

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the rounded result of the area calculation, which is incorrect as explained above.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The area should be the side length squared, but the program incorrectly multiplies the square roots of two side lengths and rounds the result.

### Correctness: **False**
