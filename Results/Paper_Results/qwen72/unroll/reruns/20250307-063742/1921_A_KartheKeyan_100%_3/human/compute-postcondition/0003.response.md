Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the variable `n` is now 0. The function `func` has not been called, and the state of other variables outside the loop remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 each time until `n` becomes 0.
- Inside the loop, the coordinates of the corners of a square are read, sorted, and the area of the square is calculated and printed.
- After the loop completes all iterations, `n` will be 0, and the loop will terminate.
- The function `func` is not called within the loop, so its state remains as it was initially defined.
- Any other variables not mentioned in the loop head or body remain unchanged.
