Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input directly from the user.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Coordinate Collection**:
   - For each test case, the function reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`.

3. **Coordinate Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a consistent order, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points: `p1` and `p2`.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in the sorted list.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in the sorted list.

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the area of the square by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then rounding the result.
   - However, since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent points (either horizontally or vertically) should be the same and should represent the side length of the square. Therefore, the area should be the square of this side length.

6. **Error in Area Calculation**:
   - The current implementation calculates the area as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, which is incorrect. Since `p1` and `p2` are both squared distances of the side length, the correct area should be `p1` or `p2` directly, as they are equal.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct way to calculate the area of the square is to take the squared distance between any two adjacent points and print that value, as it represents the area directly.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it calculates the area using an incorrect formula.

Correctness: **False**
