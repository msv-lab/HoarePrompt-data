Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the coordinates of the corners of the square. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The variable `n` is an input integer, and the loop has been executed `n` times. For each iteration, `l` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and `s` is printed. After the loop, `n` is 0.**
