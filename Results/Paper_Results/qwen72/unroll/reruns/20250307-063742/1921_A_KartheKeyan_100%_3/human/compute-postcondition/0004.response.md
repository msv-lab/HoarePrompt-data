The function `func` is intended to accept two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and a list of coordinates for the corners of the square. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, which is incorrect.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of coordinates for the corners of the square. For each test case, it should return a result based on the coordinates provided, but the specific return values are not defined in the given information.**
