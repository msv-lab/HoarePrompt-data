#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a list of integers where 1 <= len(v) <= 200,000 and 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to len(v).

    #The program returns the `decorating_function`. No changes are made to the variables `v` and `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns the `decorating_function`. No changes are made to the variables `v` and `p`.
