You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

    results.append(result)

        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9.

    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:

    #State: `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a reversed order, but with elements paired from the ends towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end. `left` is `n`, and `right` is `-1`.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is unchanged.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It sorts `arr` and then creates a new list `new_arr` by pairing elements from the ends of the sorted list towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the way the `new_arr` is constructed. The program alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr` to `new_arr`. However, this approach does not always maximize the beauty of the array.

Consider the following example:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. According to the program, the `new_arr` will be constructed as follows:
- Append `4` (largest)
- Append `1` (smallest)
- Append `3` (next largest)
- Append `2` (next smallest)

So, `new_arr` will be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.

The beauty of this array is calculated as:
- `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2`

However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`:
- `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for the array.
