Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not always compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to maximize this sum by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
   - If the length of the array \(n\) is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment correctly points out that the approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements does not always maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The example provided in the assessment demonstrates this issue clearly:
     - Input: `1 2 3 4`
     - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - Constructed `new_arr`: `[4, 1, 3, 2]`
     - Beauty: \((1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2\)
     - Maximum possible beauty: \((4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2\)

4. **Analysis**:
   - The approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences.
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by arranging the elements in a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - One correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then construct the new array by alternating between the smallest and largest elements, but in a way that maximizes the differences.
   - For example, for the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, but the latter does not always maximize the beauty.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not always produce the maximum beauty.
   - The example provided in the original assessment clearly shows a case where the program's output is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
