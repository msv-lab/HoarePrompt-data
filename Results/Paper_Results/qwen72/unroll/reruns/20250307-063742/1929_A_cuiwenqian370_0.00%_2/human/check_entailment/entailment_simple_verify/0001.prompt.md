You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We need to find the maximum beauty of an array \( a \) of length \( n \).
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- We can rearrange the elements of the array in any way to maximize the beauty.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: \( n \) (the length of the array) and \( arr \) (the array itself).
   - It sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
   - It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them one by one.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array is a good first step because it helps in understanding the range of values and their distribution.
  
- **Constructing `new_arr`:**
  - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
  - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the new array will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
  - The differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` will be:
    - \( |5 - 1| = 4 \)
    - \( |1 - 4| = 3 \)
    - \( |4 - 2| = 2 \)
    - \( |2 - 3| = 1 \)
  - The sum of these differences is \( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

- **Calculating the Beauty:**
  - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
  - This is correct because the absolute differences are always non-negative, and the approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements ensures that these differences are maximized.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
  
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the sorted array will have all elements equal, and the new array will also have all elements equal.
  - The beauty will be 0, which is correct.

- **Large Values:**
  - The program handles large values (up to \( 10^9 \)) correctly because the `sort` function and the absolute difference calculation are both robust to large values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the steps to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then alternating between the largest and smallest elements. The beauty is calculated correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Correctness: **True**
