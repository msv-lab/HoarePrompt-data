Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the way the `new_arr` is constructed. The program alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr` to `new_arr`. However, this approach does not always maximize the beauty of the array.

Consider the following example:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. According to the program, the `new_arr` will be constructed as follows:
- Append `4` (largest)
- Append `1` (smallest)
- Append `3` (next largest)
- Append `2` (next smallest)

So, `new_arr` will be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.

The beauty of this array is calculated as:
- `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2`

However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`:
- `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for the array.
