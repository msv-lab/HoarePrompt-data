The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The loop condition is `left <= right`. Given the initial state, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Since `n` is at least 2, `right` is at least 1, which means `left` (0) is always less than or equal to `right` (at least 1) in the first iteration. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
