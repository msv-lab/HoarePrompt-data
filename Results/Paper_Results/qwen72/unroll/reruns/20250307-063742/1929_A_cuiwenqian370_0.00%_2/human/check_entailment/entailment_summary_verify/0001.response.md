### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array is allowed to achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it helps in understanding the distribution of values.
   - **Constructing `new_arr`:**
     - The function constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
     - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the new array will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - **Calculating the Beauty:**
     - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
     - The absolute differences are:
       - \( |5 - 1| = 4 \)
       - \( |1 - 4| = 3 \)
       - \( |4 - 2| = 2 \)
       - \( |2 - 3| = 1 \)
     - The sum of these differences is \( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \), which is indeed the maximum possible beauty for this array.

4. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1` sorts the array, constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This matches the implementation of the function.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Elements are the Same:**
     - If all elements in the array are the same, the sorted array will have all elements equal, and the new array will also have all elements equal.
     - The beauty will be 0, which is correct.
   - **Large Values:**
     - The program handles large values (up to \( 10^9 \)) correctly because the `sort` function and the absolute difference calculation are both robust to large values.
   - **Odd and Even Length Arrays:**
     - The program correctly handles both odd and even length arrays by appending the middle element only once if the length is odd.

6. **Original Assessment Validation:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the steps taken by the program and validates that the approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements maximizes the beauty.
   - The edge cases and the general approach are correctly analyzed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the steps to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then alternating between the largest and smallest elements. The beauty is calculated correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Final: **True**
