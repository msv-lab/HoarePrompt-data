### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array is a valid step as it helps in organizing the elements to maximize the beauty.
   - **Constructing `new_arr`:**
     - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
     - However, the problem description defines the beauty as the sum of \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), not the sum of absolute differences. The program calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is different from the required sum of differences.
     - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the new array will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - The differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` will be:
       - \( 5 - 1 = 4 \)
       - \( 1 - 4 = -3 \)
       - \( 4 - 2 = 2 \)
       - \( 2 - 3 = -1 \)
     - The sum of these differences is \( 4 + (-3) + 2 + (-1) = 2 \), which is not the maximum possible beauty for this array.
     - The correct approach to maximize the beauty would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which would be:
       - \( 2 - 1 = 1 \)
       - \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)
       - \( 4 - 3 = 1 \)
       - \( 5 - 4 = 1 \)
     - The sum of these differences is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them one by one, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the sorted array will have all elements equal, and the new array will also have all elements equal.
  - The beauty will be 0, which is correct.
- **Large Values:**
  - The program handles large values (up to \( 10^9 \)) correctly because the `sort` function and the difference calculation are both robust to large values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, which is not the same as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) as required by the problem description. The correct approach is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Final: **False**
