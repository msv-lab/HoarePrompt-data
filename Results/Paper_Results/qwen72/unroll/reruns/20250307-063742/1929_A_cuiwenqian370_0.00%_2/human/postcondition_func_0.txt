The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It sorts `arr` and then creates a new list `new_arr` by pairing elements from the ends of the sorted list towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
