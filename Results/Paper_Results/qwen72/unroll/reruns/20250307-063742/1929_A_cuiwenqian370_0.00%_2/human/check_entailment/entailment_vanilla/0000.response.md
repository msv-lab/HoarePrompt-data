Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We need to find the maximum beauty of an array \( a \) of length \( n \).
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- We can rearrange the elements of the array in any way to maximize the beauty.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: \( n \) (the length of the array) and \( arr \) (the array itself).
   - It sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
   - It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them one by one.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array is a good first step because it helps in understanding the range of values and their distribution.
  
- **Constructing `new_arr`:**
  - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
  - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the new array will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
  - The differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` will be:
    - \( |5 - 1| = 4 \)
    - \( |1 - 4| = 3 \)
    - \( |4 - 2| = 2 \)
    - \( |2 - 3| = 1 \)
  - The sum of these differences is \( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

- **Calculating the Beauty:**
  - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
  - This is correct because the absolute differences are always non-negative, and the approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements ensures that these differences are maximized.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
  
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the sorted array will have all elements equal, and the new array will also have all elements equal.
  - The beauty will be 0, which is correct.

- **Large Values:**
  - The program handles large values (up to \( 10^9 \)) correctly because the `sort` function and the absolute difference calculation are both robust to large values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the steps to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then alternating between the largest and smallest elements. The beauty is calculated correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Correctness: **True**
