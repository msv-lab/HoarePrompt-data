To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a reversed order, but with elements paired from the ends towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end.
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `max_beauty` is `0`

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. This means it will iterate `n-1` times.
2. **Effect on `max_beauty`**: In each iteration, the absolute difference between the current element `new_arr[i]` and the previous element `new_arr[i-1]` is added to `max_beauty`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to understand the process better. Suppose `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 5`.

- **Initial `new_arr`**: Since `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end.
  - `new_arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

- **Loop Execution**:
  - `i = 1`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) = abs(1 - 5) = 4`
  - `i = 2`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) = abs(4 - 1) = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2]) = abs(2 - 4) = 2`
  - `i = 4`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[4] - new_arr[3]) = abs(3 - 2) = 1`

- **Final `max_beauty`**: `max_beauty = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`

### General Case:
- The loop will compute the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
- The values of `left` and `right` are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `max_beauty` will be the sum of these absolute differences.

### Output State:
- `new_arr` remains unchanged.
- `left` remains `n`.
- `right` remains `-1`.
- `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Output State: **`max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is unchanged.**
