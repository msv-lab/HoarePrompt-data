Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not always compute the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the construction of `new_arr` within the `func_1` function. The program alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr` to `new_arr`. This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array because it does not necessarily maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program correctly sorts the array `arr` in ascending order. This is a necessary step to ensure that we can manipulate the elements to maximize the beauty.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**: The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This means that for an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the `new_arr` will be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.

3. **Calculating `max_beauty`**: The program calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. For the example `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, the beauty is calculated as:
   - `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2`
   However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`:
   - `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`

4. **Optimal Approach**: To achieve the maximum beauty, we should aim to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements. One effective way to do this is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements, but in a different manner. Specifically, we can construct `new_arr` by starting with the smallest element, then the largest, then the second smallest, then the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

5. **Example Verification**: Let's verify this with the example `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
   - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Construct `new_arr` by alternating: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Calculate the beauty: `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`

This approach indeed maximizes the beauty of the array.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for the array.

Final: **False**
