The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` should start from 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a reversed order, but with elements paired from the ends towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `max_beauty` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
