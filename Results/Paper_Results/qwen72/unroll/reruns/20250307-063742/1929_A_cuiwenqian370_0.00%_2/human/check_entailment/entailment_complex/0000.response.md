Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the differences between consecutive elements should be maximized. 

The provided function `func_1` attempts to achieve this by:
1. Sorting the array `arr`.
2. Creating a new array `new_arr` by alternatingly picking the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.
3. Calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

However, the problem specifies that the beauty is \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. Therefore, the function should not use `abs` when calculating the beauty. Instead, it should directly sum the differences.

Let's analyze the function with this in mind:

1. **Sorting the array**: This step is correct because it helps in rearranging the elements to maximize the differences.
2. **Creating `new_arr`**: This step is also correct because it pairs the largest and smallest elements, which maximizes the differences.
3. **Calculating the beauty**: The function uses `abs` to calculate the differences, which is incorrect for the problem's definition of beauty. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value.

Given this, the function is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's definition of beauty.

Correctness: **False**
