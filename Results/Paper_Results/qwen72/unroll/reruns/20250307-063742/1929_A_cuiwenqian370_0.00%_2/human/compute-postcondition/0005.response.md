Output State: **`new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a reversed order, but with elements paired from the ends towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end. `left` is `n`, and `right` is `-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `left` at 0 and `right` at `n - 1`, and it continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- In each iteration, if `left` is equal to `right`, the middle element is appended to `new_arr` once.
- If `left` is not equal to `right`, the elements at the `right` and `left` indices are appended to `new_arr` in that order.
- After each iteration, `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is decremented by 1.
- The loop ends when `left` becomes greater than `right`, which means `left` will be `n` and `right` will be `-1`.
- The resulting `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr`, but in a pattern where elements are paired from the ends towards the center, and if `n` is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end.
