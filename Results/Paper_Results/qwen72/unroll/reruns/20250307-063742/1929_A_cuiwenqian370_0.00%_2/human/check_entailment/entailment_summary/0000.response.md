Reasoning:  
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To achieve this, the program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation. The problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), which means the differences should be positive. The current implementation calculates the sum of the absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, the differences should be calculated directly without taking the absolute value, and the array should be rearranged to ensure that the differences are positive.

To fix this, the elements should be placed in an alternating pattern such that the larger elements are followed by smaller elements, and vice versa. This can be achieved by starting with the smallest element, then the largest, then the second smallest, then the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are positive and maximized.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly maximize the beauty as defined in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
