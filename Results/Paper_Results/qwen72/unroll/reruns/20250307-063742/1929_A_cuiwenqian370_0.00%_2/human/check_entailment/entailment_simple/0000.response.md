Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing this beauty is to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences between consecutive elements. One effective way to achieve this is to alternate the largest and smallest remaining elements in the sorted array, which can create the largest possible positive differences.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - This part is correct and follows the input format.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array towards the center.
   - If \(n\) is odd, the middle element is appended only once at the end.
   - This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, as the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
   - The use of `abs` is correct because the problem definition involves the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), and the absolute value ensures that the differences are always positive.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct according to the output format.

Given the approach and the states described in the comments, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The states indicate that the array is processed as intended, and the final beauty calculation is performed correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
