### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the length \( n \) and elements of the array \( a \) for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array is a good first step because it helps in understanding the range of values and their distribution.
   - **Constructing `new_arr`:**
     - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
     - However, the problem description defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), not the sum of the absolute differences.
     - The current implementation of `new_arr` construction and the beauty calculation using `abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should be to calculate the differences without the absolute value, as the problem specifies \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them one by one, which is correct.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array is a good first step, but it is not the final step in the solution.
- **Constructing `new_arr`:**
  - The current implementation of alternating between the largest and smallest elements is not optimal for the given problem. The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then calculate the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) directly from the sorted array.
  - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the correct beauty calculation should be:
    - \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \).
  - The current implementation would give a different and incorrect result because it uses absolute differences.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the sorted array will have all elements equal, and the correct beauty will be 0, which is correct.
- **Large Values:**
  - The program handles large values (up to \( 10^9 \)) correctly in terms of sorting and arithmetic operations, but the logic for calculating beauty is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program's approach to constructing `new_arr` and calculating the beauty using absolute differences is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) directly from the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
