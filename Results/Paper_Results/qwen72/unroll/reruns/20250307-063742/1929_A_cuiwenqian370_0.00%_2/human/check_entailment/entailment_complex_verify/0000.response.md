Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not always compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the construction of `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr`. This approach does not always maximize the beauty of the array, as demonstrated by the example provided in the original assessment.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` in ascending order. This is a necessary step to facilitate the construction of `new_arr`.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**:
   - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr`.
   - For an even-length array, this results in a pattern like `[largest, smallest, next largest, next smallest, ...]`.
   - For an odd-length array, the middle element is appended only once at the end.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The program constructs `new_arr` as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
   - The beauty of this array is calculated as:
     - `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2`
   - However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`:
     - `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`

5. **General Case**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - The approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements does not always maximize this sum. The correct approach would be to sort the array and then pair the elements in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for the array.

Final: **False**
