You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate` is a generator that yields all possible products of the first `k` primes from the `primes` list, where each prime can be raised to a power from 0 to `factors[prime]`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, it yields 1. The function does not modify the input variables `k`, `primes`, or `factors`. It returns a series of integer values, which are the products of the primes raised to their respective powers.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Settling Pattern**: The pattern of numbers repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions. The first \(k\) positions are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\), and the next \(k - 2\) positions are numbered \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\).
2. **Constraints**: \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the number of different \(k\) that fit the given constraints.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `generate`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to factorize \(n\) and generate all divisors of \(n\).
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize an empty dictionary `factors` to store the prime factors and their counts.
  2. Initialize `nn` to \(n\) and start with the smallest prime factor \(i = 2\).
  3. Use a while loop to factorize \(n\) by dividing it by \(i\) until \(i \times i\) is greater than \(n\).
  4. If there is any remaining factor greater than 1, add it to the `factors` dictionary.
  5. Convert the keys of the `factors` dictionary to a list `primes`.
  6. Use a generator to yield all divisors of \(n\).

#### Function 2: `generate(k)`
- **Purpose**: This function generates all divisors of \(n\) using the prime factorization stored in `factors`.
- **Steps**:
  1. If \(k\) is equal to the length of `primes`, yield 1 (base case).
  2. Otherwise, recursively generate the rest of the factors.
  3. For each factor generated by the recursive call, multiply it by all powers of the current prime (from 0 to the count of the prime in `factors`).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variable `primes`**: The `primes` list is used in `generate` but is not defined in its scope. It should be passed as an argument or defined globally.
2. **Global Variable `factors`**: The `factors` dictionary is used in `generate` but is not defined in its scope. It should be passed as an argument or defined globally.
3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to factorize \(n\) and generate all divisors, but it does not correctly handle the generation of divisors. It should call `generate` with the correct arguments.
4. **Logic for Finding Valid \(k\)**: The program does not include logic to determine which of the generated divisors are valid \(k\) values based on the given constraints.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to:
1. Define `primes` and `factors` in the scope of `generate`.
2. Correctly call `generate` from `func_1` and handle the generation of divisors.
3. Implement the logic to check which \(k\) values are valid based on the given constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    return factors

def generate(primes, factors, k=0):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(primes, factors, k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    factors = factorize(n - x)
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    valid_ks = 0
    for k in generate(primes, factors):
        if k > 1 and (n - x) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            valid_ks += 1
    return valid_ks

def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, x in test_cases:
        results.append(count_valid_ks(n, x))
    return results

# Example usage
t = 5
test_cases = [
    (10, 2),
    (3, 1),
    (76, 4),
    (100, 99),
    (1000000000, 500000000)
]

results = solve(test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorize Function**: This function correctly factorizes \(n\) and returns a dictionary of prime factors and their counts.
2. **Generate Function**: This function correctly generates all divisors of \(n\) using the prime factorization.
3. **Count Valid \(k\)s Function**: This function uses the factorization to generate all divisors of \(n - x\) and checks if each divisor \(k\) is valid based on the given constraints.
4. **Solve Function**: This function processes multiple test cases and returns the results.

### Correctness:
The corrected program correctly handles the factorization and generation of divisors, and it correctly checks the validity of each \(k\) based on the given constraints. Therefore, the corrected program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
