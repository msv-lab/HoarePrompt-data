Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, the loop yields a series of values, and after the loop completes, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1` for each `factor` in `rest`, but this value is not stored or used outside the loop. The state of `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remains unchanged.***
