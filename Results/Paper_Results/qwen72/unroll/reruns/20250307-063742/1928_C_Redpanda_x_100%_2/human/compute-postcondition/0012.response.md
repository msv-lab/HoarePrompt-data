Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and returns an iterator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function computes the prime factorization of `n` and stores the prime factors and their exponents in a dictionary. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `factors` is a dictionary where the keys are the prime factors of `n` and the values are the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of `n`. The variable `primes` is a list containing all the prime factors of `n`. The function does not modify the original value of `n`. **
