You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    #State: The loop does not modify the variables `i`, `nn`, `factors`, or `primes`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state: `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the initial `n`, `nn` is the largest prime factor of `n` or 1, `factors` is a dictionary with prime factors of `n` as keys and their exponents as values, and `primes` is a list containing all the prime factors of `n`. If `nn` is greater than 1, the value of `factors[nn]` is incremented by 1.

After the loop completes, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`, but this value is not stored or used outside the loop. The state of `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remains unchanged.
    #State: *`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, the loop yields a series of values, and after the loop completes, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1` for each `factor` in `rest`, but this value is not stored or used outside the loop. The state of `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling. However, the provided program is attempting to generate factors of a number and does not address the specific logic required to solve the problem.

Here is a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It attempts to factorize the number \( n \) and store the factors in a dictionary.
   - It then tries to generate factors using a generator function `generate`, but it does not return the number of valid \( k \) values as required by the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`generate`)**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields combinations of factors, but it does not contribute to solving the problem of finding valid \( k \) values.

The program does not implement the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given position \( n \) and number \( x \). For example, the program does not handle the case where \( n \) and \( x \) are given and it needs to check the constraints for \( k \).

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- For the input \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the program does not return the correct number of valid \( k \) values (which should be 4 based on the problem description).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
