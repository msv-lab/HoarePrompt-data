### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern is: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n)`**:
     - This function computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and returns an iterator that yields all possible divisors of \( n \).
     - It correctly identifies and stores the prime factors and their exponents in a dictionary.
     - The `generate` function is used to generate all possible products of these prime factors, which are the divisors of \( n \).
   - **`generate(k)`**:
     - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the first \( k \) primes from the `primes` list.
     - It correctly handles the base case when \( k \) equals the length of `primes`, yielding 1.
     - It recursively generates all combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two sets of possible \( k \) values:
     - `ans` is derived from the divisors of \( n - x \).
     - `ans2` is derived from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) (only if \( x \neq 1 \)).
   - The program then combines these sets and prints the length of the combined set, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Validation of the Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) using the `func_1` function.
   - It filters the divisors to ensure they are even and that \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \), which is a necessary condition for the settling pattern.
   - The union of the two sets ensures that all possible \( k \) values are considered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( x = 1 \) by not computing `ans2`.
   - It also ensures that \( k \) is greater than 1, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case based on the given constraints. The functions `func_1` and `generate` work together to generate the necessary divisors and filter them appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
