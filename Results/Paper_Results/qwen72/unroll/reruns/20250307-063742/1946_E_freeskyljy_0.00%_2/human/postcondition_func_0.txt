The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` from the user. It returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: 1) The last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, 2) The first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`, or 3) Both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates a modified binomial coefficient based on the values of `M1` and `M2`. The final result is returned as `ans`.
