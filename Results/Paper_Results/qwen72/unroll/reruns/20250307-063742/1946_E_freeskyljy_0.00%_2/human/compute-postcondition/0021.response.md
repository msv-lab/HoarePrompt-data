Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers, and `L` is a list of integers that includes `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `M1` > 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is the result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` after applying the loop's modifications. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2` and the other variables retain their initial values.**
