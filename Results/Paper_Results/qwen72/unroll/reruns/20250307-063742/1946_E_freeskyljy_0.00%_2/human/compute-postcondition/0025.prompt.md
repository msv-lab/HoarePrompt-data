Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers, and `L` is a list of integers that includes `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `M2` is greater than 1. `cur` is 1. `i` is `N + 1`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` after applying the loop's modifications. Otherwise, the other variables retain their initial values.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
