Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers. `L` is a list of integers that includes the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1, `M2` is greater than 1, and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.**
