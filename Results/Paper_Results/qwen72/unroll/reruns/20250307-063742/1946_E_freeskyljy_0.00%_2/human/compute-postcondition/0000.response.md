Output State: **The function should take three parameters: `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, where `N` is the length of the permutation, and `M1` and `M2` are the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists, `p` and `s`, of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the lists `p` and `s` should be sorted in increasing order with 1 ≤ `p[i]`, `s[i]` ≤ `N`. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers.**
