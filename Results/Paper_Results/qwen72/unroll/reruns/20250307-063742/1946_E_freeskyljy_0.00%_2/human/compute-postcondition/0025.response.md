Output State: **`i` is `N + 1`, `cur` is the number of elements in `R` that are less than or equal to `N`, `nums_left` is `-N - 1`, and `ans` is the result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` after being modified by the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop starts with `i` as `N + 1` and runs until `i` is no longer less than `N`, `i` will be `N + 1` after the loop finishes.
- **`cur`**: The variable `cur` is incremented each time `i` equals an element in `R`. Therefore, `cur` will be the number of elements in `R` that are less than or equal to `N` after the loop finishes.
- **`nums_left`**: `nums_left` starts at `-1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `N - (N + 1) + 1 = N - N = 0` times, `nums_left` will be `-1 - N = -N - 1` after the loop finishes.
- **`ans`**: If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is initially the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. The loop modifies `ans` by multiplying it by `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not in `R`. The final value of `ans` will depend on the number of such iterations.

The other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
