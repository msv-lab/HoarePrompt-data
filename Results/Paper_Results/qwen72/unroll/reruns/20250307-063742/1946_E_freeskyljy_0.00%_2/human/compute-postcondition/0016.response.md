Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers. `L` is a list of integers that includes the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
