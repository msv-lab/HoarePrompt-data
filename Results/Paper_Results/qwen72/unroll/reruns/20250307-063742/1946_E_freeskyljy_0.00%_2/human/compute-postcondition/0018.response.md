Output State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `nums_left` is -1, and `ans` is the result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` after applying the loop's modifications.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it reaches 1. Since the loop condition is `i > 1`, the loop will stop when `i` becomes 1.
- **`cur`**: `cur` starts at `M1 - 2` and is decremented each time `i` matches `L[cur]`. Given that `L` is a list of integers and `L[-1]` is the first element of `R`, and `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1`, the loop will decrement `cur` until it reaches 0.
- **`nums_left`**: `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs until `i` is 1, `nums_left` will be decremented `L[-1] - 2` times, resulting in `nums_left` being -1.
- **`ans`**: `ans` is initially the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. In each iteration where `i` does not match `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The final value of `ans` will be the result of these multiplications.

The other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
