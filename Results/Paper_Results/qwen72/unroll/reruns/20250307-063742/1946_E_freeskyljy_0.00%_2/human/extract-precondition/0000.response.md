Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, and m1 and m2 are the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists, p and s, of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the lists p and s should be sorted in increasing order with 1 ≤ p[i], s[i] ≤ n.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s` as described above.
