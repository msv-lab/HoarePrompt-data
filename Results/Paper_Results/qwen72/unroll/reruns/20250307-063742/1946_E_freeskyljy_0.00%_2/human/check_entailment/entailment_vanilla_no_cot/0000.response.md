Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:
  - **Input Handling**: The function reads input using `input().split()` and `map(int, input().split())`, but it does not handle the input correctly for multiple test cases. The `input()` should be read inside the loop that iterates over the number of test cases.
  - **Initial Checks**: The initial checks for `L[0] != 1` and `R[0] != N` are incorrect. The first prefix maximum should always be at index 1, and the first suffix maximum should always be at index `N`. However, the condition `L[-1] != R[0]` is correct because the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum should be the same.
  - **Combination Calculation**: The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums and how they affect the placement of the remaining elements.
  - **Loop Logic**: The logic in the loops for calculating the number of valid permutations is flawed. The way `nums_left` and `ans` are updated does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def func_1():
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the first prefix maximum is at index 1 and the first suffix maximum is at index N
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the answer
    ans = 1
    
    # Calculate the number of valid permutations
    for i in range(1, M1):
        ans = ans * math.comb(L[i] - L[i-1] - 1, R[i] - L[i-1] - 1) % MOD
    
    for i in range(1, M2):
        ans = ans * math.comb(R[i] - R[i-1] - 1, L[i] - R[i-1] - 1) % MOD
    
    return ans

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The input is read correctly for each test case.
- The initial checks are performed correctly.
- The combination calculations are done in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.
