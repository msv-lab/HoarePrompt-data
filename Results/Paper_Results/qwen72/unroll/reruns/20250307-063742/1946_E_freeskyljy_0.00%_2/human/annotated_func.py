#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, and m1 and m2 are the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists, p and s, of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the lists p and s should be sorted in increasing order with 1 ≤ p[i], s[i] ≤ n.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` from the user. It returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: 1) The last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, 2) The first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`, or 3) Both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates a modified binomial coefficient based on the values of `M1` and `M2`. The final result is returned as `ans`.
