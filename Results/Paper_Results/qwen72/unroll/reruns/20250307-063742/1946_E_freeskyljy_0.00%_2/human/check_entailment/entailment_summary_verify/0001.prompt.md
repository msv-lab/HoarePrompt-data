You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` from the user. It returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: 1) The last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, 2) The first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`, or 3) Both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates a modified binomial coefficient based on the values of `M1` and `M2`. The final result is returned as `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `L` and `R`, which contain the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of the prefix maximums list `L` is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums list `R`. This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation must be a common element in both lists.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is because the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum, and the last element must be a suffix maximum.
   - If `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1`, it checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This is to ensure that the second largest element in the permutation is not incorrectly placed.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial combination `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, which represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the remaining elements of the permutation, given that the maximum element is at position `L[-1]`.

4. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each position `i` that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements (`nums_left`), and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This ensures that the elements are placed in a way that respects the prefix maximums.

5. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each position `i` that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements (`nums_left`), and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This ensures that the elements are placed in a way that respects the suffix maximums.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is returned after processing both the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the initial validity checks, ensuring that the input is consistent with the problem constraints.
- The combination calculation and the subsequent multiplication steps are designed to count the number of valid permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the maximum element is at the intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums, which is correct.
- The program correctly handles the placement of elements around the maximum element, ensuring that the prefix and suffix maximums are respected.
- However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where the maximum element is the only element in both `L` and `R` (i.e., `M1 = 1` and `M2 = 1`). In such a case, the answer should be 1, but the program might still work correctly due to the initial checks.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. It handles the edge cases and the main logic is sound.
