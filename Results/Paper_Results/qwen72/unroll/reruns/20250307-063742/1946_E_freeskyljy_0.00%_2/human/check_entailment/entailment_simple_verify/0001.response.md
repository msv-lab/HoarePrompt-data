### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and the lists `L` and `R` containing the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of the prefix maximums list `L` is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums list `R`. This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation must be a common element in both lists.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is because the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum, and the last element must be a suffix maximum.
   - If `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1`, it checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This check is to ensure that the second largest element in the permutation is not incorrectly placed, which is a valid constraint.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial combination `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, which represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the remaining elements of the permutation, given that the maximum element is at position `L[-1]`.

4. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each position `i` that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements (`nums_left`), and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This ensures that the elements are placed in a way that respects the prefix maximums.

5. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each position `i` that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements (`nums_left`), and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This ensures that the elements are placed in a way that respects the suffix maximums.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is returned after processing both the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the initial validity checks, ensuring that the input is consistent with the problem constraints.
- The combination calculation and the subsequent multiplication steps are designed to count the number of valid permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the maximum element is the only element in both `L` and `R` (i.e., `M1 = 1` and `M2 = 1`). However, this case is implicitly handled by the initial checks, as the program will return 1 if `L[0] == 1` and `R[0] == N`, which is correct.
- The program correctly handles the placement of elements around the maximum element, ensuring that the prefix and suffix maximums are respected.
- The program's logic for multiplying the answer by the number of remaining elements (`nums_left`) is sound and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. It handles the edge cases and the main logic is sound.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
