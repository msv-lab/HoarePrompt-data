Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers. `L` is a list of integers that includes the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold.**
