The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`. Here, `n` is the length of the permutation, `m1` and `m2` are the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively, and `p` and `s` are lists of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the lists `p` and `s` should be sorted in increasing order with 1 ≤ p[i], s[i] ≤ n.

The function returns:
- **Case 1:** 0
- **Case 2:** 0
- **Case 3:** 0
- **Case 4:** The result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`, which is modified based on the conditions for `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, the binomial coefficient is modified by a loop. If `M2` > 1, the binomial coefficient is modified by another loop. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, the binomial coefficient remains as `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`, and returns 0 in the first three cases. In the fourth case, it returns a modified binomial coefficient based on the conditions for `m1` and `m2`. If `m1` > 1, the binomial coefficient is adjusted by a loop. If `m2` > 1, it is adjusted by another loop. If neither `m1` nor `m2` is greater than 1, the binomial coefficient remains as `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.**
