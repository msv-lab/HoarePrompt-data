To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < N`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers.
- `L` is a list of integers that includes `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements.
- `R` is a list of integers from the input.
- The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `nums_left` is `-1`.
- `M2` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is 1.
- `i` is `N + 1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is `i < N`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Currently, `i` is `N + 1`, which means the loop will not execute.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust `i` so that it is less than `N`. The simplest adjustment would be to set `i` to a value that is less than `N`, such as `i = N - 1`.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers, and `L` is a list of integers that includes `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `M2` is greater than 1. `cur` is 1. `i` is `N - 1`.**
