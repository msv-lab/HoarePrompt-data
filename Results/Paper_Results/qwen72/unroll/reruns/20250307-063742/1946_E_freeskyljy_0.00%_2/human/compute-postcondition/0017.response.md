To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i > 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers.
- `L` is a list of integers that includes the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements.
- `R` is a list of integers from the input.
- The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.
- Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1.

The variable `i` is the only one in the loop head, and its value is `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

Since `L[-1]` is the last element of `L` and it is equal to the first element of `R`, and `R[0]` is `N`, we need `N` to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

Given that `M1` is greater than 1, and the constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` must be at least 3 to satisfy `i > 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `N` is greater than 2, which will make `i` greater than 1.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third inputs, respectively, converted to integers. `L` is a list of integers that includes the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` as its first three elements. `R` is a list of integers from the input. The constraints 1 ≤ `M1`, `M2` ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5 still hold. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. Additionally, `N` must be greater than 2.**
