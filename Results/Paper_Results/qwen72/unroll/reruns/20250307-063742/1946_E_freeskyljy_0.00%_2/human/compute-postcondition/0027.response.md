Output State: **The program returns the result of the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`, which is modified based on the conditions for `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient after applying the loop's modifications. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient after being modified by the loop. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.**
