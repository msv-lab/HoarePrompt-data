Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, `M1`, and `M2` which are the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads two lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (the last prefix maximum) is equal to the first element of `R` (the first suffix maximum). If not, it returns `0` because this condition is necessary for a valid permutation.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is `1` and the first element of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns `0` because the first prefix maximum must be at index `1` and the first suffix maximum must be at index `N`.

3. **Conflict Check**:
   - The program checks if `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns `0` because it would imply a conflict in the permutation where the same element is both a prefix and a suffix maximum at the same index.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` which represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the remaining elements in the permutation.
   - It then iterates over the indices from `L[-1] - 1` down to `1` to adjust the answer based on the prefix maximums. This loop ensures that the elements between the last prefix maximum and the start of the permutation are correctly placed.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the indices from `R[0] + 1` to `N` to adjust the answer based on the suffix maximums. This loop ensures that the elements between the first suffix maximum and the end of the permutation are correctly placed.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program uses the modulo operation to ensure that the answer does not exceed \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `M1` or `M2` is `1` by skipping the respective loops, which is correct because if there is only one prefix or suffix maximum, the placement of the remaining elements is straightforward.

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The program returns the final answer `ans` which is the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices. It handles all the necessary conditions and constraints, and the combination and loop adjustments are correctly applied to ensure the answer is accurate and within the modulo limit.
