#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), and two lists of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}) and (s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}). For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 and m_2 are positive integers (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n) representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The lists p and s contain distinct integers in strictly increasing order, with 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n, and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #The program returns the value of `ans`, which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and may be further modified by the conditions involving `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and two lists of integers `L` and `R`. It checks several conditions and returns 0 if any of the following are true: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1 or `R[0]` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function computes a value `ans` based on the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is further modified by multiplying it by the factorial of `L[-1] - 2` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Similarly, if `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is again modified by the same factorial and modulo operation. The final value of `ans` is returned.
