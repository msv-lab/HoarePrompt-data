Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Condition for First and Last Elements**:
   - The program checks `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N`, but this is incorrect. The first prefix maximum should always be at index 1, and the last suffix maximum should always be at index N. However, the correct condition should be `if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N`.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Overlapping Indices**:
   - The program checks `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])`, but this is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be to check if any prefix maximum index (except the last one) is the same as any suffix maximum index (except the first one).

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Combinations**:
   - The program calculates `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, but this is not the correct way to calculate the number of permutations. The correct approach involves calculating the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Gaps**:
   - The program attempts to handle the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the gaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def func_1():
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the first prefix maximum is at index 1 and the last suffix maximum is at index N
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    
    # Check if any prefix maximum (except the last one) is the same as any suffix maximum (except the first one)
    if set(L[:-1]) & set(R[1:]):
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place the remaining elements
    ans = 1
    last_prefix = 0
    for i in range(M1):
        gap = L[i] - last_prefix - 1
        if gap > 0:
            ans = ans * math.factorial(gap) % MOD
        last_prefix = L[i]
    
    last_suffix = N + 1
    for i in range(M2 - 1, -1, -1):
        gap = last_suffix - R[i] - 1
        if gap > 0:
            ans = ans * math.factorial(gap) % MOD
        last_suffix = R[i]
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to interleave the remaining elements
    remaining = N - M1 - M2 + 1
    ans = ans * math.comb(remaining + M1 - 1, M1 - 1) % MOD
    ans = ans * math.comb(remaining + M2 - 1, M2 - 1) % MOD
    
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly solve the problem.
