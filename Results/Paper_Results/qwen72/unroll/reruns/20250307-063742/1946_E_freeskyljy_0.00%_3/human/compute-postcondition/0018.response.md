Output State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is `M1 - L[-1]`, `nums_left` is 0, `ans` is the result of the computation `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it reaches 1, so the final value of `i` is 1.
- **`cur`**: `cur` is decremented each time `i` matches an element in `L`. Since `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1` and ends at 1, `cur` will be decremented `L[-1] - 2` times. Therefore, the final value of `cur` is `M1 - L[-1]`.
- **`nums_left`**: `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `L[-1] - 2` times, `nums_left` will be 0 at the end.
- **`ans`**: `ans` is initially set to the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. In each iteration where `i` does not match an element in `L`, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `ans` will be multiplied by all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, which is the factorial of `L[-1] - 2` (denoted as `(L[-1] - 2)!`). Therefore, the final value of `ans` is `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`.

The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
