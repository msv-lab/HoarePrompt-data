Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**
