You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the indices of the suffix maximums `R`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `L[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `R[0]`. If not, it returns 0 because the maximum element must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first prefix maximum index `L[0]` is 1 and the first suffix maximum index `R[0]` is `N`. If either of these conditions is not met, it returns 0 because the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum and the last element must be a suffix maximum.
   - It checks if there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums and if the second-to-last prefix maximum index `L[-2]` is equal to the second suffix maximum index `R[1]`. If this condition is met, it returns 0 because the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum cannot be the same element in a valid permutation.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to place the maximum element in the permutation using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is because the maximum element can be placed in any of the `N-1` positions, and we need to choose `L[-1] - 1` positions for the elements before it.

4. **Left Side Calculation:**
   - If there are more than one prefix maximums, the program iterates from the second-to-last prefix maximum index down to 1.
   - For each index, it checks if the current index is a prefix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Right Side Calculation:**
   - If there are more than one suffix maximums, the program iterates from the second suffix maximum index up to `N-1`.
   - For each index, it checks if the current index is a suffix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The program returns the final answer, which is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The initial checks are correct and necessary to ensure the validity of the permutation.
- The combination calculation is correct for placing the maximum element.
- The left and right side calculations are also correct and ensure that the remaining elements are placed in a way that respects the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- The logic for calculating the number of valid permutations is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
