Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.***
