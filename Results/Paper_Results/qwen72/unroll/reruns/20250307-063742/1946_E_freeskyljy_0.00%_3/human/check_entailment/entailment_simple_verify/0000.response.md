Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is called without passing the necessary parameters, which is indeed a logical error. However, the assessment also incorrectly states that the condition `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N` is wrong and should be `if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N`. This part of the assessment is incorrect because the condition `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N` is actually correct based on the problem description:

1. **Prefix Maximums**: The first element of the prefix maximums list `L` should be 1 because the smallest element (1) in a permutation must be a prefix maximum.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: The first element of the suffix maximums list `R` should be `N` because the largest element (`N`) in a permutation must be a suffix maximum.

The original program correctly checks these conditions. The error lies in the function call and the handling of the input parameters. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is indeed more accurate and should be used.

However, the original program has another issue that was not mentioned in the assessment: the combination calculation and the subsequent multiplication logic are not entirely correct. Specifically, the combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the multiplication logic do not correctly account for the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements to satisfy the prefix and suffix maximums conditions.

### Corrected Implementation:
The corrected implementation should:
1. Ensure that the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`.
2. Ensure that the last element of `L` is the same as the first element of `R`.
3. Correctly calculate the number of valid permutations by considering the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = int(1000000000.0 + 7)

def func_1(N, M1, M2, L, R):
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):
        return 0
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, M1):
        ans = ans * math.comb(L[i] - L[i-1] - 1, i - 1) % MOD
    for i in range(1, M2):
        ans = ans * math.comb(R[i] - R[i-1] - 1, i - 1) % MOD
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(N, M1, M2, L, R))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` now correctly takes `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` as parameters.
2. **Initial Checks**:
   - `if L[-1] != R[0]`: Ensures the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum.
   - `if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N`: Ensures the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `N`.
   - `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])`: Ensures that the second-to-last prefix maximum is not the same as the second suffix maximum.
3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The first loop calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the prefix maximums.
   - The second loop calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums.
   - The combination `math.comb(L[i] - L[i-1] - 1, i - 1)` and `math.comb(R[i] - R[i-1] - 1, i - 1)` are used to count the valid arrangements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues with function calls and the combination calculation logic. The corrected version provided above addresses these issues and should be used.

Final: **False**
