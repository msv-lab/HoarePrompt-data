You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), and two lists of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}) and (s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}). For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 and m_2 are positive integers (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n) representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The lists p and s contain distinct integers in strictly increasing order, with 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n, and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #The program returns the value of `ans`, which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and may be further modified by the conditions involving `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cases` where each element is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), and two lists of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}) and (s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}). For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 and m_2 are positive integers (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n) representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The lists p and s contain distinct integers in strictly increasing order, with 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n, and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns 0 in three cases, and in the fourth case, it returns a value `ans` which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns the value of `ans`, which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and may be further modified by the conditions involving `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.
