Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. If `M1` > 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is `M1 - L[-1]`, and `ans` is the result of the computation `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, which simplifies to `N - N - 1` or `-1`. The current value of `M2` is greater than 1.**
