### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `L` and `R` for the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program first checks if the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot have a valid structure where the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum do not coincide.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`. If either of these conditions is true, it returns 0 because the first prefix maximum must be 1 and the first suffix maximum must be `N` in any valid permutation.
   - Finally, it checks if `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because it would imply a conflict in the structure of the permutation.

2. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial value of `ans` using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This represents the number of ways to choose the positions of the elements in the permutation that are not the last prefix maximum.

3. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - If `M1 > 1`, the program processes the prefix maximums by iterating from the second-to-last element of `L` down to 1. It multiplies `ans` by the number of available positions for each element that is not a prefix maximum, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - If `M2 > 1`, the program processes the suffix maximums by iterating from the second element of `R` up to `N`. It multiplies `ans` by the number of available positions for each element that is not a suffix maximum, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program returns the final value of `ans`, which is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The initial checks ensure that the permutation can be valid based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The combination calculation is correct for the initial setup of the permutation.
- The processing of prefix and suffix maximums is done correctly by iterating through the lists and multiplying the available positions, ensuring that the constraints are met.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

However, there is a potential issue in the state comments and the logic for `nums_left` in the suffix maximums processing. Specifically, the comment states that `nums_left` becomes `-N` after the loop, which is incorrect. `nums_left` should be 0 after the loop, as it is decremented for each position processed.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issue in the state comments, the logic of the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
