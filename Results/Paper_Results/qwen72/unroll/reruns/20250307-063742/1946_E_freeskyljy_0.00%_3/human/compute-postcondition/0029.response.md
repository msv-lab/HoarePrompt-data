Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input values for `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and two lists of integers `L` and `R`. It checks several conditions and returns 0 if any of the following are true: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1 or `R[0]` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function computes a value `ans` based on the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is further modified by multiplying it by the factorial of `L[-1] - 2` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Similarly, if `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is again modified by the same factorial and modulo operation. The final value of `ans` is returned. **
