### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, followed by the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the indices of the suffix maximums `R`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - **Check 1:** `if L[-1] != R[0]: return 0`
     - This check ensures that the maximum element (which must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum) is correctly placed. If the last element of `L` (the last prefix maximum) is not equal to the first element of `R` (the first suffix maximum), the permutation is invalid.
     - This check is correct.
   - **Check 2:** `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N: return 0`
     - This check ensures that the first element of the permutation is a prefix maximum and the last element is a suffix maximum.
     - This check is correct.
   - **Check 3:** `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]: return 0`
     - This check ensures that the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum are not the same element. If they are, the permutation is invalid.
     - This check is correct.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to place the maximum element using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
   - This is correct because the maximum element can be placed in any of the `N-1` positions, and we need to choose `L[-1] - 1` positions for the elements before it.

4. **Left Side Calculation:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last prefix maximum index down to 1.
   - For each index, it checks if the current index is a prefix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the remaining elements are placed in a way that respects the prefix maximums.

5. **Right Side Calculation:**
   - The program iterates from the second suffix maximum index up to `N-1`.
   - For each index, it checks if the current index is a suffix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the remaining elements are placed in a way that respects the suffix maximums.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The program returns the final answer, which is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The initial checks are correct and necessary to ensure the validity of the permutation.
- The combination calculation is correct for placing the maximum element.
- The left and right side calculations are also correct and ensure that the remaining elements are placed in a way that respects the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- The logic for calculating the number of valid permutations is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
