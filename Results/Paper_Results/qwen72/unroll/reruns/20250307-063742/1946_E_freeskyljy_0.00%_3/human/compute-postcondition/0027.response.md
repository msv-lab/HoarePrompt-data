Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans`, which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and may be further modified by the conditions involving `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.**
