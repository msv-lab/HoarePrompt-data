The code snippet `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `R`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input.**
