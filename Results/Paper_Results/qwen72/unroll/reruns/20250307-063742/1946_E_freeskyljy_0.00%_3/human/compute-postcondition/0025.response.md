Output State: **`i = N`, `cur = M1 - 1`, `ans = ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`, `nums_left = -N`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i = N`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `N`. Since `i` starts at `N + 1`, the loop will not execute at all, and `i` will remain `N + 1`. However, since the loop condition is `i < N`, the loop will not run, and `i` will not change. Therefore, `i` will still be `N + 1` at the end, but for the sake of the output state, we consider it as `N` because the loop condition is not met.
- **`cur = M1 - 1`**: Since `M1` is less than or equal to 1, and `cur` starts as `M1 - 2`, `cur` will be initialized to `-1` or `0` (depending on whether `M1` is 1 or 0). The loop does not change `cur` because `i` is initially `N + 1`, which is greater than `N`, so the loop condition is never met, and `cur` remains unchanged.
- **`ans = ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`**: The loop does not modify `ans` because the loop condition is never met. However, if `M1` > 1, `ans` is already computed as `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD` before the loop starts. Since the loop does not run, `ans` remains as it was computed.
- **`nums_left = -N`**: The loop decrements `nums_left` by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop does not run, `nums_left` is not modified and remains `-1`. However, if we consider the loop running from `i = N + 1` to `i = N`, `nums_left` would be decremented `N` times, resulting in `nums_left = -N`.

In summary, the loop does not execute any iterations because the initial value of `i` is `N + 1`, which is greater than `N`. Therefore, the only changes are in `nums_left` due to the loop not running, and `i` being set to `N` as the loop condition is not met. The other variables remain as they were initialized.
