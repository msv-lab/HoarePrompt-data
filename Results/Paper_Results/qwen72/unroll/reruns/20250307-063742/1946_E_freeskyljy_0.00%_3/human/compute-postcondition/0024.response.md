To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < N`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `cases` is a list of tuples
- `N` is an input integer
- `M1` is an input integer
- `M2` is an input integer
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`
- Either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`
- `ans` is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`
- If `M1` > 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is 1, and `ans` is the result of the computation `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`
- Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `-1`
- The current value of `M2` is greater than 1
- `i` is `N + 1`

The condition `i < N` must be true for the loop to execute. Currently, `i` is `N + 1`, which means `i` is greater than `N`, so the loop will not execute.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the value of `i` so that it is less than `N`. The simplest adjustment would be to set `i` to a value that is less than `N`. Since `i` is currently `N + 1`, we can set `i` to `N - 1` or any value less than `N`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `ans` is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`, if `M1` > 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is 1, and `ans` is the result of the computation `ans * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`, otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `-1`, the current value of `M2` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`**
