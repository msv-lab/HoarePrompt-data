Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cases` where each element is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), and two lists of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}) and (s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}). For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 and m_2 are positive integers (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n) representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The lists p and s contain distinct integers in strictly increasing order, with 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n, and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns 0 in three cases, and in the fourth case, it returns a value `ans` which is the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is also multiplied by `(L[-1] - 2)!` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If neither `M1` nor `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` remains the initial combination value.**
