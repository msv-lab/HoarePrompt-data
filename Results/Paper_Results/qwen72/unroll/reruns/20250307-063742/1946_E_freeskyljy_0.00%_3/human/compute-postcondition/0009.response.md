Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer greater than 1, `M2` is an input integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.**
