Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), and two lists of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}) and (s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}). For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), `m_1` and `m_2` are positive integers (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n) representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The lists `p` and `s` contain distinct integers in strictly increasing order, with 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n, and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer.**
