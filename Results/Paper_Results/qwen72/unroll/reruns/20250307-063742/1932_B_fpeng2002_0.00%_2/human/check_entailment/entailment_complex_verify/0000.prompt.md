You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

        for x in range(0, len(nums)):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop where the number of iterations is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: The `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0, and the `start_year` variable is updated to the last computed value for each test case, which represents the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in the `nums` list, starting from 0. The `n` and `nums` variables are updated for each test case based on the input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` integers `nums` (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function then computes and prints the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in `nums`, starting from year 0. After processing all test cases, the `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential waiting rule as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Year Calculation**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
3. **Sequential Sign Calculation**: For each sign, the program updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that the next sign starts waiting from the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
4. **Formula Explanation**: The formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that:
   - `start_year + 1` is the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
   - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)` calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign will occur.

This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting and ensures that the signs occur in the required order. The program also handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers.

Since the program meets the requirements for every potential case and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
