You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` integers `nums` (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function then computes and prints the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in `nums`, starting from year 0. After processing all test cases, the `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description:
- The problem states that there are \( n \) signs of the apocalypse, and the \( i \)-th sign occurs every \( a_i \) years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning if the \( i \)-th sign occurs in year \( x \), the \( (i+1) \)-th sign must occur after year \( x \).
- The goal is to find the year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs, which will mark the apocalypse.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `num_tests = int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the list of periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) using `n = int(input())` and `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the year in which the signs occur.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign using a for loop: `for x in range(0, len(nums))`.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` using the formula: `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Understanding the Formula:**
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division, which gives the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity that have occurred by the current year.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the year in which the next cycle of the sign occurs.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For the first sign (3): `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For the second sign (2): `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For the third sign (4): `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For the fourth sign (5): `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For the fifth sign (9): `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For the sixth sign (18): `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For the first sign (1): `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For the second sign (2): `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For the third sign (3): `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
  - For the fourth sign (4): `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For the fifth sign (5): `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Output: `5` (Correct, but the program output is `10` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `5` as per the example.)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For each sign (1): `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1` (repeated 5 times)
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For the first sign (50): `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For the second sign (30): `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 90`
  - For the third sign (711): `start_year = ((90 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For the fourth sign (200): `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 1000`
  - For the fifth sign (503): `start_year = ((1000 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1509`
  - For the sixth sign (1006): `start_year = ((1509 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it fails for the second test case. The issue is that the program should output `5` for the second test case, but it outputs `10`. This is because the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not correctly handling the sequential nature of the signs for the second test case.
