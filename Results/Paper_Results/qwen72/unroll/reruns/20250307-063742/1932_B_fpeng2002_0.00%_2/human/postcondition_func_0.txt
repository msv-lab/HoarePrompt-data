The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` integers `nums` (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function then computes and prints the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in `nums`, starting from year 0. After processing all test cases, the `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
