Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop where the number of iterations is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `num_tests` is an input integer.**
