You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop where the number of iterations is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: The `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0, and the `start_year` variable is updated to the last computed value for each test case, which represents the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in the `nums` list, starting from 0. The `n` and `nums` variables are updated for each test case based on the input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns a result for each test case, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, the function processes the list `a` (of length `n` with elements 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and returns a specific output based on the periodicities of the signs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
