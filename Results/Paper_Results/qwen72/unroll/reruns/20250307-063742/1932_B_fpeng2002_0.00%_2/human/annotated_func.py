#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop where the number of iterations is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: The `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0, and the `start_year` variable is updated to the last computed value for each test case, which represents the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in the `nums` list, starting from 0. The `n` and `nums` variables are updated for each test case based on the input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` integers `nums` (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function then computes and prints the earliest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities in `nums`, starting from year 0. After processing all test cases, the `num_tests` variable is decremented to 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
