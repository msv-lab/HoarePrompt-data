Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The function processes multiple test cases, each with a different set of periodicities.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num_tests` from the input.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `num_tests` times, processing each test case.

2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `nums` representing the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Computing the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting year.
   - The function iterates over the list `nums` and updates `start_year` for each sign.
   - For each sign `x`, the function calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the previous sign has occurred. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[x]
     \]
     - The expression \((\text{start\_year} + 1) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\) finds the smallest integer greater than \(\text{start\_year} + 1\) that is a multiple of \(\text{nums}[x]\).
     - Multiplying this integer by \(\text{nums}[x]\) gives the next year in which the sign will occur.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the function prints the value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function continues to process test cases until `num_tests` is decremented to 0.

The logic of the function is correct because it ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one by always finding the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the year in which the previous sign occurred. This aligns with the problem's requirement that the signs must occur sequentially.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the function correctly computes the earliest year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
