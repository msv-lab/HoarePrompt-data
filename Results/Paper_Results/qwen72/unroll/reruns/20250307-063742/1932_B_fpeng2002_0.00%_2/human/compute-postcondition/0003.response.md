The function `func` should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the periodicities of the signs, and `n` represents the number of signs. The length of the list `a` is equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function should be called in a loop where the number of iterations is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which represents the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns a result for each test case, where the number of test cases is determined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, the function processes the list `a` (of length `n` with elements 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and returns a specific output based on the periodicities of the signs.**
