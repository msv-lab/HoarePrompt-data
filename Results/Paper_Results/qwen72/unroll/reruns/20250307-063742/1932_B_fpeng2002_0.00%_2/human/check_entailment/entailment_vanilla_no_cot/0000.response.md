Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`). For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the current year.

3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. Here's a step-by-step explanation:
   - `start_year + 1`: This ensures that the next sign occurs after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]`: This finds the number of complete cycles of the current sign's periodicity that fit into the current year plus one.
   - `+ 1`: This ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]`: This calculates the actual year when the next sign occurs.

4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
