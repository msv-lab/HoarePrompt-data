Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the earliest year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of each sign. The key logic in the program is the loop that iterates through each sign and calculates the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Loop through signs**: For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the quotient when the current year is divided by the periodicity of the sign.
   - `+ 1` ensures that the next occurrence is the next multiple of the periodicity.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year of the next occurrence.

This formula correctly ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. The program then prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and the logic is consistent with the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
