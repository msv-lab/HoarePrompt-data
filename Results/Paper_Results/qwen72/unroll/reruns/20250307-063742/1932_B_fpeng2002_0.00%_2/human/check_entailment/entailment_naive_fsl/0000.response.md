Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential waiting rule as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Year Calculation**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
3. **Sequential Sign Calculation**: For each sign, the program updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that the next sign starts waiting from the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
4. **Formula Explanation**: The formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that:
   - `start_year + 1` is the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
   - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)` calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign will occur.

This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting and ensures that the signs occur in the required order. The program also handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers.

Since the program meets the requirements for every potential case and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
