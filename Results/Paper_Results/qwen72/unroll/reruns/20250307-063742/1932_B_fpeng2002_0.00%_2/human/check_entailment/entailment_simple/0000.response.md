Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of each sign. The key aspect of the problem is that signs must occur sequentially, and the next sign can only occur after the previous sign has occurred. The program uses a loop to process each test case and a nested loop to compute the year for each sign based on the provided periodicities.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   ```python
   num_tests = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   while num_tests > 0:
       num_tests -= 1
   ```
   This loop processes each test case one by one, decrementing `num_tests` after each iteration. This is also correct.

3. **Reading the Number of Signs:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads the number of signs, `n`, for the current test case. This is correct as per the problem description.

4. **Reading the Periodicities of the Signs:**
   ```python
   nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
   ```
   This line reads the periodicities of the signs, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and stores them in the list `nums`. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Computing the Year for Each Sign:**
   ```python
   start_year = 0
   for x in range(0, len(nums)):
       start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is the starting year.
   - The loop iterates over each sign's periodicity in `nums`.
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, starting from `start_year + 1`. This is done using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

   The formula works as follows:
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign can only occur after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division, which gives the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity up to `start_year + 1`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` multiplies the cycle number by the periodicity to get the exact year of the next occurrence.

   This formula correctly computes the year in which the next sign will occur, ensuring that it is strictly after the previous sign.

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   ```python
   print(start_year)
   ```
   After the loop, `start_year` contains the year in which the n-th sign will occur. This is printed for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program handles multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
