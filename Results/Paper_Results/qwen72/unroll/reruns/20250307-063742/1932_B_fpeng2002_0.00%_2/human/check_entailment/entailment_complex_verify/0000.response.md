Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential waiting rule as described. Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify this:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initial Year Calculation**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
   - This is correct as the problem starts from year 0.

3. **Sequential Sign Calculation**:
   - The program updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that the next sign starts waiting from the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
   - The formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to calculate the next occurrence of the sign.
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `start_year + 1` is the year immediately after the current sign occurs.
     - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)` calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign will occur.
   - This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting and ensures that the signs occur in the required order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1 and when the periodicities are large numbers.
   - For example, if all signs have a periodicity of 1, the program will correctly output the year `n` for each test case.
   - For large periodicities, the formula ensures that the next multiple is correctly calculated.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the computed `start_year` for each test case.
   - This matches the problem description, which requires the output to be the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Given the annotations and the breakdown of the program, the logic and implementation are sound. The program correctly follows the sequential waiting rule and computes the earliest year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Final: **True**
