Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `k` from the standard input, constructs the adjacency list `adj`, and performs a binary search to find the maximum value `L` such that the number of cuts `numCuts` is greater than or equal to `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and the leftover value is greater than or equal to `x`. After all iterations, the final value of `L` is printed for each iteration. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` are reset for each iteration, and the final output is the sequence of `L` values for each test case.**
