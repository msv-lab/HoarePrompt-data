The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it seems there should be parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. Given the constraints:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5.
- `adj` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the adjacent vertices of the corresponding vertex.

The function likely processes these parameters to perform some graph-related operation, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Since the output is not specified, I cannot describe the exact return value. However, based on typical graph functions, it might return some form of graph traversal result, a specific path, or a boolean indicating a condition.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= k < n <= 10^5), and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a graph. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided.**
