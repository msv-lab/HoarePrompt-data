The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of cuts `k`, constructs an adjacency list `adj` representing a tree, and performs a binary search to determine the maximum value `L` such that the number of cuts required to achieve a certain condition is greater than or equal to `k` or exactly `k` with a leftover value meeting a specific threshold. The function prints the value of `L` for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` are reset for each test case, and the final state of the program is the sequence of printed `L` values corresponding to each test case.
