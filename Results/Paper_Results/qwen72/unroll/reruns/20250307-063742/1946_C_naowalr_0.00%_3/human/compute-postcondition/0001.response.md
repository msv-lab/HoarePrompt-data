The only objects in the loop head are the variables `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of an input integer read from the standard input, which must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. The variables `n`, `k`, and `adj` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (t >= 1), `z` is 0**
