Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the phone is turned off and on at the same moment as sending a message. Specifically, the program does not account for the initial charge consumption when the phone is turned on at the first message moment. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
1 3 1 5
3

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES
```

In this test case, the phone starts with 3 units of charge. If the phone is turned on at moment 0 and remains on until moment 3, it will lose 3 units of charge (3 - 0) * 1 = 3, leaving the phone with 0 units of charge, which means the message cannot be sent. If the phone is turned off and on at moment 3, it will lose 5 units of charge, which is also more than the initial charge, so the message cannot be sent. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO", but the program outputs "YES".
