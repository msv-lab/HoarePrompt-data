### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of integers `ls` representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element.
   - For each message, it calculates the charge loss between the current message and the previous message. The charge loss is the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` (charge loss due to time) and `b` (charge loss due to turning the phone off and on).
   - It subtracts this minimum charge loss from the current charge `f`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages in the list, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f` is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f` is less than or equal to 0, it prints 'NO', indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases and Integer Overflow:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it does not enter the loop and directly checks the initial charge.
   - The function should be able to handle large values of `f`, `a`, and `b` without integer overflow, assuming Python's built-in integer type can handle large values.

5. **Initial Charge Check:**
   - The function does not explicitly check the initial charge `f` before the loop, which is necessary to ensure that the phone has enough charge to send the first message. This is a critical oversight.

### Correctness:
- The function is almost correct but has a critical flaw: it does not check if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send the first message. If `f` is less than `a * ls[0]`, the phone will not have enough charge to send the first message, and the function should print 'NO' immediately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function needs to include a check for the initial charge before entering the loop to ensure that the phone has enough charge to send the first message.
