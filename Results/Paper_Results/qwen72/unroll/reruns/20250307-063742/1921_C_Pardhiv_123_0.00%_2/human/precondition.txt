t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains four integers n, f, a, b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, where n is the number of messages, f is the initial phone's charge, a is the charge consumption per unit of time, and b is the consumption when turned off and on sequentially. Additionally, each test case contains a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
