Correctness: **True**

The program is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `arr`.
3. **Output Calculation**: The program prints `x - 2` for each test case. This is the correct formula for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using `x` vertices in a regular polygon with `n` sides, given that `y = 0` (i.e., no additional vertices can be chosen).

### Explanation of the Formula:
- **Triangulation of a Polygon**: A polygon with `x` vertices can be triangulated into `x - 2` triangles. This is a well-known result in computational geometry.
- **Given Constraints**: Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices, so the maximum number of triangles is determined solely by the vertices Bessie has chosen, which is `x - 2`.

### Example Verification:
- For `n = 8`, `x = 4`, and `y = 0` with vertices `1, 6, 2, 5`, the maximum number of triangles is `4 - 2 = 2`.
- For `n = 8`, `x = 8`, and `y = 0` with vertices `1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8`, the maximum number of triangles is `8 - 2 = 6`.
- For `n = 4`, `x = 2`, and `y = 0` with vertices `1, 3`, the maximum number of triangles is `2 - 2 = 0`. However, since a polygon with 2 vertices cannot form a triangle, the output is correctly `2 - 2 = 0`.

The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly, so it is indeed correct.
