Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is not defined with the correct parameters. It should be defined as `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` to match the problem description. The function should take the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the list of chosen vertices `chosen_vertices`.

2. **Logic**: The program simply prints `x - 2` for each test case. This is incorrect because the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is not always `x - 2`. The correct logic should involve calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

3. **Constraints**: The problem specifies that `y = 0`, meaning you cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the solution should only consider the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

4. **Output**: The output for each test case should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake, which is not necessarily `x - 2`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
