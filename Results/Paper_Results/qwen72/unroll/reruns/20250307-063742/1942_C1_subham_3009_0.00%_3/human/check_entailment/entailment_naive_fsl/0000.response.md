Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints `x - 2` as the number of triangular pieces of cake, which is not always the correct answer. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 3 0
1 2 4
```
In this case, the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 2, and 4. The program will output `1` (since `3 - 2 = 1`). However, the correct answer should be `2`, as you can form two non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 4) and (2, 3, 4).

This shows that the program does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
