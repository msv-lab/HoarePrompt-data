### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for the given problem description. However, the function reads input directly within its body, which is a common practice in competitive programming.
   - The function should ideally be defined as `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` to match the problem description, but since it reads input directly, it still works in the context of the problem.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices and converts them to a list of integers.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints `x - 2` for each test case.
   - According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` chosen vertices in a polygon is indeed `x - 2`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are respected: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0`.
   - The function does not use `y` since it is always 0, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `x = 2` by printing `0` (since `2 - 2 = 0`), which is correct because no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices.
   - The function also handles the case where `x = n` (all vertices are chosen) by printing `n - 2`, which is correct because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` vertices is `n - 2`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct result for each test case. The only minor issue is the function definition, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution in the given context.

### Correctness:
**True**
