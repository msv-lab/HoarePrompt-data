Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0`. The program is currently executing in the main module, meaning the code block under the `if (__name__ == '__main__')` condition is being evaluated. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
