Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Three integers: `n` (number of sides of the polygon), `x` (number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `y` (maximum number of other vertices you can choose, which is always 0 in this version).
     - A list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of `x` vertices Bessie has chosen and converts them to integers.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Reasoning:
- **Understanding the Problem**:
  - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
  - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
  - In a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`.

- **Correctness of the Solution**:
  - The formula `x - 2` is correct for the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon.
  - This is because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can be triangulated into `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

- **Handling Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints:
    - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
    - `4 <= n <= 10^9`
    - `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
    - `y = 0`

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should work for the edge cases where `x = 2` or `x = 3`:
    - If `x = 2`, the number of triangles is `0` (since you need at least 3 vertices to form a triangle).
    - If `x = 3`, the number of triangles is `1` (since 3 vertices form exactly one triangle).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
