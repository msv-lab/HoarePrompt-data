Output State: **t is 0, and the loop has printed `x - 2` for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration.
- In each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input, and a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.
- The loop then prints `x - 2` for each iteration.
- After `t` iterations, the value of `t` becomes 0, and the loop terminates.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` are read and used in each iteration but are not retained between iterations.
- The variable `y` is read but not used in the loop body, so its value is irrelevant to the output state.
- The initial state of the function `func` and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` outside the loop remain unchanged.
