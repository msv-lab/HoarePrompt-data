#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0` (though `y` is not used in the function parameters, it is part of the problem constraints).
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: t is 0, and the loop has printed `x - 2` for each iteration.
    #State: *If the script is run as the main program, `t` is set to 0, and the loop prints `x - 2` for each iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables and no output is produced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the script is run as the main program, it reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, and a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the loop terminates, and the function ends with `t` set to 0. If the script is not run as the main program, no changes are made to the variables and no output is produced.
