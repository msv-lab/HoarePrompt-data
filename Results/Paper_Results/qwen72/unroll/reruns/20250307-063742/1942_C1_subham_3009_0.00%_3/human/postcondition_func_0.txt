The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the script is run as the main program, it reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, and a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the loop terminates, and the function ends with `t` set to 0. If the script is not run as the main program, no changes are made to the variables and no output is produced.
