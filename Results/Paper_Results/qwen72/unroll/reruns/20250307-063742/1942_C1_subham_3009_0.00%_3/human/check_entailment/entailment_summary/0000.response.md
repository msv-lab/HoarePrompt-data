### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie and potentially additional vertices chosen by you. However, in this version of the problem, \( y = 0 \), which means you cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the only vertices available for forming triangles are the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie.

Given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides and \( x \) chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \). This is a well-known property in computational geometry: any convex polygon with \( k \) vertices can be triangulated into \( k - 2 \) non-intersecting triangles.

The program reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (where \( y \) is always 0). It then reads the list of \( x \) chosen vertices and prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case. This matches the expected behavior and output for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie. The output for each test case is \( x - 2 \), which is the correct solution based on the problem's constraints and the provided execution summary.
