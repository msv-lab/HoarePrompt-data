### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Structure**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for the problem. However, the function is only used when the script is run as the main program, and it reads the necessary inputs within the function.
   - The function reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of `x` vertices Bessie has chosen and converts them to integers.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.
   - The formula `x - 2` is indeed correct for the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry.

4. **Handling Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints:
     - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
     - `4 <= n <= 10^9`
     - `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
     - `y = 0` (though `y` is not used in the function, it is part of the problem constraints).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should work for the edge cases where `x = 2` or `x = 3`:
     - If `x = 2`, the number of triangles is `0` (since you need at least 3 vertices to form a triangle).
     - If `x = 3`, the number of triangles is `1` (since 3 vertices form exactly one triangle).

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. However, the program's structure and logic are correct for the given problem constraints.
  - The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):`, but the current implementation reads the inputs within the function and processes them correctly.

- **State of the program within the loop**:
  - The program reads `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case.
  - It reads the list of `x` vertices and converts them to integers.
  - It prints `x - 2` for each test case.

- **State of the program after the loop**:
  - After processing all test cases, `t` is set to 0, and the loop has printed `x - 2` for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case. The formula `x - 2` is accurate for the given constraints and edge cases.
