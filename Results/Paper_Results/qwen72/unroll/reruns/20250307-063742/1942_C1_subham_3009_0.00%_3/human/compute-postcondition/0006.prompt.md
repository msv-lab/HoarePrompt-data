You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0` (though `y` is not used in the function parameters, it is part of the problem constraints).
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: t is 0, and the loop has printed `x - 2` for each iteration.
    #State: *If the script is run as the main program, `t` is set to 0, and the loop prints `x - 2` for each iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables and no output is produced.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon; `x`, an integer representing the number of chosen vertices; and `chosen_vertices`, a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices. It returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices of the polygon, excluding the chosen vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
