The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is calculated as the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since `a` and `b` are both positive, the absolute value of their product is simply their product.
