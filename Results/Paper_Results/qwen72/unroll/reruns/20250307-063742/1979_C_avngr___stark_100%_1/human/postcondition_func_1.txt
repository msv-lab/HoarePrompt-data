The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list. The state of the `numbers` list remains unchanged after the function call.
