### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)`.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.
   - **func_2(numbers):** This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers. It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The program checks if the total amount bet is less than `m`. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k` ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a common multiple of the multipliers.
   - The condition `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` is checked by ensuring that `sum(c) < m`. If this condition is met, the bets are valid.
   - If the condition is not met, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of coins exists.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the bets will be equal. In this case, the total bet will be `n * (m // k_i)`, which is equal to `m` if `n == k_i`. This is why the program correctly prints `-1` for such cases.
   - For other cases, the LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
