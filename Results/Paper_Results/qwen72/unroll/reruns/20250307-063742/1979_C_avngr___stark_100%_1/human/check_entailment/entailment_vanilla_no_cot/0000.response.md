Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not relevant to the problem of distributing coins to ensure a profit in a game with multiple outcomes.

To solve the problem, you need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. This can be achieved by setting the bet for each outcome in such a way that the sum of the bets is less than the smallest product of the bets and their respective multipliers. Here's a more appropriate approach:

1. For each test case, calculate the sum of the multipliers.
2. For each outcome, set the bet to be `1` divided by the multiplier, then scale all bets by a common factor to ensure they are integers and the total sum is less than the smallest product of the bets and their respective multipliers.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        k = case[1]
        total_sum = sum(k)
        bets = [total_sum // (ki * n) + 1 for ki in k]
        if sum(bets) < total_sum:
            results.append(bets)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, k))

# Solving and printing output
results = solve(test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This program correctly addresses the problem by ensuring that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. If no such distribution is possible, it outputs `-1`.
