### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `k_i` is the multiplier and `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers `k_i`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers `numbers`.
   - It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.
   - The result is the LCM of all the multipliers `k_i`.

4. **Main Program:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that each bet `x_i` is `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the total amount bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than `m`.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets `x_i`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` ensures that `m` is a multiple of all `k_i`.
   - By setting `x_i = m // k_i`, the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i) = sum(m // k_i)`.
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < m` to hold, the sum of the bets must be strictly less than the LCM.
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all `k_i` are the same, the sum of the bets `sum(x_i)` will be `n * (m // k_i)`.
   - For the condition to hold, `n * (m // k_i)` must be less than `m`.
   - This is only possible if `n < k_i`, which is not guaranteed by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case. It uses the LCM to ensure that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The program also correctly handles cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
