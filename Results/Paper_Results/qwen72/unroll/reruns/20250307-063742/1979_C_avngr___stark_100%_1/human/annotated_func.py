#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are both positive integers, the absolute value of their product is simply their product, and the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is calculated as the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since `a` and `b` are both positive, the absolute value of their product is simply their product.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is equal to the final value returned by the repeated application of `func_1` to the elements of the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list. The state of the `numbers` list remains unchanged after the function call.
