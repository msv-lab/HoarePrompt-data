The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the slice `numbers[1:]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the slice `numbers[1:]`. If `numbers[1:]` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers and `result` is equal to the first integer in the `numbers` list, the loop will execute if `numbers` has more than one element.

For the loop to execute, `numbers[1:]` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element in `numbers[1:]`.

State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `result` is equal to the first integer in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second integer in the `numbers` list**
