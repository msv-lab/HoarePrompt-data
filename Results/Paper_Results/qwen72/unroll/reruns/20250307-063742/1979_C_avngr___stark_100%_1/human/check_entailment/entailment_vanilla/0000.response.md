To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it solves the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has `n` outcomes with multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   - The goal is to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `-1` if no solution exists.
   - Otherwise, output `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that:
     - The total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for each `i`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution includes two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The formula used is `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, which is correct for finding the LCM.

2. **func_2(numbers):**
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iterates through the list and uses `func_1` to compute the LCM progressively.
   - The final result is the LCM of all numbers in the list.

### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that:
- The total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for each `i`.

One way to ensure this is to find a common multiple of the multipliers `k_i` and then distribute the bets in such a way that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome. The LCM of the multipliers can be used to find such a common multiple.

However, the provided solution only calculates the LCM of the multipliers and does not distribute the bets. The LCM itself does not directly give us the bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`. Instead, we need to use the LCM to determine the bets.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Calculating the LCM of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
2. Distributing the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any outcome.

For example, if the LCM of the multipliers is `L`, we can set `x_i = L // (k_i - 1)` for each `i`. This ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Provided Solution:
The provided solution only calculates the LCM and does not distribute the bets. Therefore, it does not solve the problem as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not distribute the bets and only calculates the LCM, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
