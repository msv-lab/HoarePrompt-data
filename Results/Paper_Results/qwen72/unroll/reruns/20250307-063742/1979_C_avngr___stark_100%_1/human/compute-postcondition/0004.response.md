The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers. The function returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list.
