You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are both positive integers, the absolute value of their product is simply their product, and the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is calculated as the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since `a` and `b` are both positive, the absolute value of their product is simply their product.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is equal to the final value returned by the repeated application of `func_1` to the elements of the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns the final value obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the list, starting with the first element and then applying the function to the result and each subsequent element in the list. The state of the `numbers` list remains unchanged after the function call.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but the problem requires a different approach to determine the bets for each outcome.

The problem requires that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided functions do not address this requirement. Instead, they compute the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's solution.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the product of each bet with its corresponding multiplier. This can be achieved by setting each bet \( x_i \) to a value that ensures the total sum of bets is less than the smallest product \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        k = case[1]
        total_sum = sum(k)
        if min(k) <= 1:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        bets = [1] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if k[i] * bets[i] <= total_sum:
                bets[i] = (total_sum + 1) // k[i]
        if sum(bets) < total_sum:
            results.append(bets)
        else:
            results.append(-1)
    return results

# Example usage:
test_cases = [
    (3, [3, 2, 7]),
    (2, [3, 3]),
    (5, [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]),
    (6, [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]),
    (3, [6, 3, 2]),
    (5, [9, 4, 6, 8, 3])
]

results = solve(test_cases)
for result in results:
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This code correctly handles the problem by ensuring that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers, and it provides a valid set of bets for each test case. The provided program does not meet this requirement and thus is incorrect.
