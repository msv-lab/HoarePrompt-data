### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), if the i-th outcome wins, the amount received back is \( k_i \times x_i \), where \( x_i \) is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).
   - The condition to satisfy is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_2` to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - The LCM is used to determine the minimum amount of coins \( m \) that can be distributed in such a way that the condition is satisfied.
   - The bets \( x_i \) are calculated as \( m // k_i \) for each outcome \( i \).
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than \( m \). If not, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), which is correct.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.
   - The initial value of `result` is set to the first element of the list, and then it is updated by computing the LCM with each subsequent element.
   - The final value of `result` is the LCM of all elements in the list, which is correct.

5. **Main Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It calculates the bets \( x_i \) as \( m // k_i \) for each outcome \( i \).
   - It checks if the sum of the bets is strictly less than \( m \). If not, it prints \(-1\).
   - If the sum of the bets is less than \( m \), it prints the bets.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \) is satisfied for all \( i \).
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution of coins is possible by printing \(-1\).
   - The program ensures that the bets are positive integers and within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the coins in a way that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
