### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the provided program step by step using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `func_2` function.
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the bets `x_i` as `m // k[i]` where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - This means each bet `x_i` is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`.

4. **Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than the LCM `m`.
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it outputs `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Analysis of the Bet Calculation:
- The key idea is to ensure that the total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i`.
- The program calculates `x_i` as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
- This means that for each outcome `i`, the return `k_i * x_i` is `k_i * (m // k_i)`, which simplifies to `m` (since `k_i` divides `m` exactly).
- Therefore, the return for any winning outcome is always `m`.
- The total bet `sum(x_i)` is the sum of `m // k_i` for all `i`.

### Validity Check:
- The program checks if `sum(x_i) < m`.
- If `sum(x_i) >= m`, it outputs `-1` because the total bet is not strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
- If `sum(x_i) < m`, it outputs the bets `x_i`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- `k = [3, 2, 7]`
- `m = LCM(3, 2, 7) = 42`
- `x_1 = 42 // 3 = 14`
- `x_2 = 42 // 2 = 21`
- `x_3 = 42 // 7 = 6`
- `sum(x_i) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- `sum(x_i) < m` (41 < 42), so the program outputs `14 21 6`.

#### Test Case 2:
- `k = [3, 3]`
- `m = LCM(3, 3) = 3`
- `x_1 = 3 // 3 = 1`
- `x_2 = 3 // 3 = 1`
- `sum(x_i) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `sum(x_i) < m` (2 < 3), so the program outputs `1 1`.

#### Test Case 3:
- `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- `m = LCM(5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5`
- `x_1 = 5 // 5 = 1`
- `x_2 = 5 // 5 = 1`
- `x_3 = 5 // 5 = 1`
- `x_4 = 5 // 5 = 1`
- `x_5 = 5 // 5 = 1`
- `sum(x_i) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`
- `sum(x_i) >= m` (5 >= 5), so the program outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets `x_i`. The validity check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
