Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the phone needs to be turned on at the moment of the first message. The initial charge is not checked against the charge required to send the first message. If the initial charge `f` is less than the charge required to send the first message at `m_1`, the program will still try to send the message, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
1 2 1 3
3

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES
```

In this case, the initial charge `f` is 2, and the first message needs to be sent at moment 3. The phone will lose 3 units of charge by the time it reaches moment 3, which is more than the initial charge. Therefore, Stepan cannot send the message, and the output should be "NO". However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES".
