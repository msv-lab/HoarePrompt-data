Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of messages, initial charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `ls` which represent the moments at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the list of message times `ls` starting from the second message (index 1).
   - For each message, it calculates the charge consumption between the current message and the previous message. This is done using the formula `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`.
   - The `min` function ensures that the charge consumption is the lesser of the charge lost by keeping the phone on (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) or the charge lost by turning the phone off and on (`b`).

3. **Final Charge Check**:
   - After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES" indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO" indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there is only one message correctly. In this case, the loop does not run, and the initial charge `f` is checked directly.
   - The program also handles the case where the initial charge `f` is less than the charge required to send the first message.

5. **Integer Overflow**:
   - The program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle large numbers without overflow. This is important for the last test case where large values are provided.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, where n is the number of messages. This is appropriate given the constraints.

7. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
