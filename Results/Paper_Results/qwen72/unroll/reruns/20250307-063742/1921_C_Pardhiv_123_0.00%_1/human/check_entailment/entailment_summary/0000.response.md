### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `ls`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the list `ls` and calculates the charge `f` after each message is sent.
   - It updates `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` for each pair of consecutive message times.
   - This approach is correct because:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` represents the charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message time to the current message time.
     - `b` represents the charge lost if the phone is turned off after the previous message and turned on again just before the current message.
     - The minimum of these two values is the optimal charge loss to ensure the phone has enough charge to send the next message.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all messages, the function checks if `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f` is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f` is 0 or less, it prints 'NO', indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `t` is 1 or the maximum allowed value (10^4).
   - It also handles the edge case where `n` is 1, which is correctly managed by the initial value of `f`.

5. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The function does not explicitly handle integer overflow, but Python's integer type can handle very large numbers without overflow, so this is not a concern for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages based on the provided problem description and constraints. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case as expected and outputs the correct result.
