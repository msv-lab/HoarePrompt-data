### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of moments `ls` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the list of message moments `ls` starting from the second element.
   - For each message moment `ls[i]`, it calculates the charge loss between the current moment and the previous moment `ls[i-1]`.
   - The charge loss is calculated as the minimum of two values:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1])`: the charge lost if the phone remains on.
     - `b`: the charge lost if the phone is turned off and then turned on again.
   - This ensures that Stepan can choose the most efficient way to manage the charge between messages.

3. **Final Charge Check**:
   - After processing all message moments, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO", indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the large values of `f`, `a`, and `b` (up to \(10^9\)).
   - It also handles the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **Initial Charge**:
   - The initial charge `f` is not adjusted before the loop, which is correct because the phone starts with `f` units of charge at moment 0.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient and avoids unnecessary operations, making it suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages based on the given constraints and input. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the charge is managed efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
