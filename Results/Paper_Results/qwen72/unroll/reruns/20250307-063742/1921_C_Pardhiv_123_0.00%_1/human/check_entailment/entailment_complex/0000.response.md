### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of moments `ls`.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the list of moments `ls` starting from the second element.
   - For each pair of consecutive moments `(ls[i], ls[i-1])`, it calculates the charge loss as the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1])` (charge loss due to time) and `b` (charge loss due to turning off and on).
   - This is a correct approach because Stepan can either keep the phone on and lose charge over time, or turn it off and on to save charge, whichever is less.

3. **Initial Charge Check**:
   - The function does not explicitly check the initial charge before the first message is sent. However, since the initial charge `f` is given and the first message is sent at `m_1`, the initial charge should be sufficient to send the first message if `f >= a * m_1`.

4. **Final Charge Check**:
   - After processing all messages, the function checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints 'NO', indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the loop does not run, and the function directly checks if the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message.
   - The function also handles the case where the charge `f` is very large and the time intervals are large, ensuring no integer overflow occurs.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic of subtracting the minimum charge loss between consecutive messages is correct.
   - The function correctly updates the charge `f` and checks if it remains positive after all messages are processed.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles the given problem constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
