The function `func` accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m` where `m` contains `n` elements. The parameters have the following constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9.
- `m` is a list of integers where each element `m_i` satisfies 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m` with the specified constraints, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
