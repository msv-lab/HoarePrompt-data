The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` and a list of `n` integers `ls`. It then iterates through the list `ls` and updates the value of `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` for each pair of consecutive elements. After processing the list, it prints 'YES' if `f` is greater than 0, and 'NO' otherwise. The function continues this process for all `t` test cases. After all test cases are processed, `t` is 0, and the function ends.
