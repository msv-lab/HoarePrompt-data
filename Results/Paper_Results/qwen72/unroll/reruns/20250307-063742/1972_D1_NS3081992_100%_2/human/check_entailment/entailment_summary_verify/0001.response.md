### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This condition ensures that \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).
   - However, the condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is not the most appropriate for the problem. It should be \(i \le m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) to ensure that \(b\) does not exceed \(m\) and \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).

5. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - However, this expression is not correct for the problem. The correct expression should be \((n // i)\) to count the number of multiples of \(i\) that are less than or equal to \(n\).

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair. This adjustment is not necessary and could lead to incorrect results.

7. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.
   - The input and output handling functions (`func_10()` and `sys.stdout.write()`) are correctly used to read the number of test cases and print the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The loop condition and the expression used to count valid pairs are incorrect, leading to potential overcounting or undercounting of valid pairs. The final adjustment of `ans - 1` is also unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
