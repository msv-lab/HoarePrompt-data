Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the first value from the recursive call minus the integer division of `a` by `b` times the second value from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. **
