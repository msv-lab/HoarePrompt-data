Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or `i` is `m + 1` if that condition is not met.**

In natural language: The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is calculated by summing the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for all `i` starting from 1 up to the point where `i * i` is greater than `n + i`, or up to `m + 1` if that condition is never met.
