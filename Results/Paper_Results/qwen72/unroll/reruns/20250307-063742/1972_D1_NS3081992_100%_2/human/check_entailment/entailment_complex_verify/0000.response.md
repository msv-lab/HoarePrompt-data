Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_15` does not correctly implement the required conditions for counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's break down the logic of `func_15` and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each pair (a, b), where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - Count the number of such pairs.

2. **Function `func_15` Logic**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem's condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. It simply performs integer division and adds the result to `ans`.
   - The function does not iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - The function does not compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` or check the required condition.

4. **Example**:
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.
   - The function `func_15` will not correctly count these pairs. It will instead count something entirely different based on the loop and division logic.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
