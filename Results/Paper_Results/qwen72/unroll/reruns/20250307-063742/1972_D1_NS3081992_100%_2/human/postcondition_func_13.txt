The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
