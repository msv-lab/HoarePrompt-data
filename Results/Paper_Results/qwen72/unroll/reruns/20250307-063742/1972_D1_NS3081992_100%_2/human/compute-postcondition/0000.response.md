The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
