    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers read from a line of space-separated input from stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any arguments. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of integers is returned, which represents the converted parts of the input line.

    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, where `rows_number` is a non-negative integer.

    #The program returns a byte string representing the next line from the standard input, with trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters.

It then splits the string into individual parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` that is present in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes the elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and returns the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to this final returned value. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, while `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the end of the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.

    #The program returns the value of `y` as it was returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, the value of `x - a // b * y` where `x` is also returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, and the value of `g` as it was returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the first value from the recursive call minus the integer division of `a` by `b` times the second value from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or `i` is `m + 1` if that condition is not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7`. The function then returns this sum minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It prints the result of `func_15()` for a number of iterations determined by the output of `func_10()`. Each result is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value. The state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.
