You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` is the core of the solution. It reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).
   - The function `func_15()` seems to be leveraging the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This condition ensures that \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).

5. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair.

7. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.

8. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input and output handling functions (`func_10()` and `sys.stdout.write()`) are correctly used to read the number of test cases and print the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The mathematical insight and loop conditions are appropriate for the problem constraints, and the input/output handling is correct.

Correctness: **True**
