The function `func_15` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it operates with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m + 1` if the condition is not met. It then returns the value of this sum minus 1.
