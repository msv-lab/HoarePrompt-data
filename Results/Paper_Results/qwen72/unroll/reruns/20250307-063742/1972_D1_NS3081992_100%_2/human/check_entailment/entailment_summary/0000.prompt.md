Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from the standard input and returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any arguments. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of integers is returned, which represents the converted parts of the input line.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the result as a byte string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a byte string representing the next line from the standard input, with trailing whitespace removed, is returned.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes the resulting bytes to a string. The function returns this string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a string of integers separated by whitespace. It then splits the string into individual parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a positive integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables, and the final state of the program is that the returned list contains the results of `func_7()` for each element.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the standard input and returns the same string. After the function concludes, the program has the string that was provided as input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned the integer input by the user, and no other state changes occur.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input has been processed and a list of strings is available for further use.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` that is present in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes the elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and returns the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to this final returned value. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, while `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the end of the function.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the first value from the recursive call minus the integer division of `a` by `b` times the second value from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7`. The function then returns this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It prints the result of `func_15()` for a number of iterations determined by the output of `func_10()`. Each result is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value. The state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.
