The function `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of integers is returned, which represents the converted parts of the input line.
