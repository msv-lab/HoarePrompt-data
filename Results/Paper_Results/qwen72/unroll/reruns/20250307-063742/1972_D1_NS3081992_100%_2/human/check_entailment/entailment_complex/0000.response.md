### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.
   - These functions correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16()` iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_15()` to compute the result for the current test case and printing it.
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases as required.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - `func_15()` is the main function that computes the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The logic in `func_15()` is as follows:
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
     - For each valid `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
     - This implies that `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` attempts to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by iterating over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in this context) and checking the condition `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - However, the condition `i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem's requirement. The correct condition should be based on the divisibility of `a + b` by `b * gcd(a, b)`.

5. **Correctness of the Core Logic**:
   - The core logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop and the condition `i * i <= n + i` are not sufficient to ensure that the pairs `(a, b)` meet the required condition.
   - The function `func_15()` is likely to produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the core logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the condition specified in the problem statement. The loop and the condition used in `func_15()` are not aligned with the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

**Correctness: False**
