### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).
   - The function `func_15()` seems to be leveraging the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This condition ensures that \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).
   - However, the loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is not the most straightforward or correct way to ensure \(a\) does not exceed \(n\). A more appropriate condition would be \(i \le \sqrt{n}\) or \(i \le m\), whichever is smaller.

5. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - However, the loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) can be misleading and might not correctly handle all cases, especially when \(n\) and \(m\) are large.

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair. This adjustment is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

7. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result using `sys.stdout.write()`.

8. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input and output handling functions (`func_10()` and `sys.stdout.write()`) are correctly used to read the number of test cases and print the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is not appropriate, and the final adjustment `ans - 1` is incorrect. These issues can lead to incorrect results, especially for larger values of \(n\) and \(m\).

Final: **False**
