Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic of `func_15()`, which is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement this condition.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_15()`**:
   - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given condition.

2. **Use of `sys.stdin.buffer.readline()`**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` use `sys.stdin.buffer.readline()`, which is not necessary for this problem and can be simplified to using `input()` or `sys.stdin.readline()`.

3. **Redundant Functions**:
   - Functions like `func_12`, `func_13`, and `func_14` are not used in the main logic and are irrelevant to the problem.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is less common and can be simplified to using `print`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a function that iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case and prints the results in the required format.
