### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required conditions.
   - The loop in `func_15`:
     ```python
     while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
         ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
         i += 1
     ```
     - This loop iterates over values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
     - It calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and adds this to `ans`.
     - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked in this loop.
     - Instead, the loop seems to be counting the number of times \((n + i)\) can be divided by \(i^2\), which is not related to the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The function `func_15` will not correctly count these pairs because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Function `func_16` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, `func_16` will also produce incorrect results for the test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
