You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` that is present in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes the elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and returns the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to this final returned value. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, while `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the end of the function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the first value from the recursive call minus the integer division of `a` by `b` times the second value from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `m + 1` or `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the value of `i` before the loop terminates.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or `i` is `m + 1` if that condition is not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7`. The function then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on the output of `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations and `func_15()` to generate the result for each iteration.
def func_16():

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and for each iteration, `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed on a new line. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It prints the result of `func_15()` for a number of iterations determined by the output of `func_10()`. Each result is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value. The state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` is the core of the solution. It reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).
   - The function `func_15()` seems to be leveraging the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This condition ensures that \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).

5. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair.

7. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.

8. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input and output handling functions (`func_10()` and `sys.stdout.write()`) are correctly used to read the number of test cases and print the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The mathematical insight and loop conditions are appropriate for the problem constraints, and the input/output handling is correct.

Correctness: **True**
