### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` is the core of the solution. It reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This condition ensures that \(a\) does not exceed \(n\).
   - However, the loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is not the most appropriate. It should be \(i \le m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) to ensure that \(i\) does not exceed \(m\) and the condition \(a \le n\) is met.

5. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair. However, this adjustment is not necessary and might lead to incorrect results.

7. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.

8. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input and output handling functions (`func_10()` and `sys.stdout.write()`) are correctly used to read the number of test cases and print the results.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is not the most appropriate. It should be \(i \le m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) to ensure that \(i\) does not exceed \(m\) and the condition \(a \le n\) is met.
  - The current condition might lead to incorrect results for some values of \(n\) and \(m\).

- **Final Adjustment:**
  - The function returns `ans - 1` to account for the fact that the loop might count one extra pair. This adjustment is not necessary and might lead to incorrect results.
  - For example, in the first test case where \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the loop will only run once with \(i = 1\), and \((n + i) // (i \cdot i) = 2 // 1 = 2\). Subtracting 1 from 2 gives 1, which is correct, but this might not hold for other cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
- The loop condition should be \(i \le m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) to ensure correctness.
- The final adjustment `ans - 1` is not necessary and might lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

Final: **False**
