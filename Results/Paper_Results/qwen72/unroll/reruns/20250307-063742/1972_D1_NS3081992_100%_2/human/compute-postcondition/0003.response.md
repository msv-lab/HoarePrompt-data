The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It relies on the output of `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations and `func_15()` to generate the result for each iteration. The function returns a list of results generated by `func_15()` for each iteration.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of results generated by calling `func_15()` for a number of iterations determined by the output of `func_10()`.**
