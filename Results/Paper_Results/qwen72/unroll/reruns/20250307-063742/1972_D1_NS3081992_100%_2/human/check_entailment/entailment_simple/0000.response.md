### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case from the standard input using `func_7()`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_15()`:**
   - The function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and continues as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\). This condition is derived from the problem's constraints and is used to optimize the calculation.
   - For each valid `i`, the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is added to `ans`.
   - The loop terminates when \(i \cdot i > n + i\) or when `i` exceeds `m`.
   - The function returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - `func_16()` iterates over the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result on a new line.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_15()` is based on the observation that for a pair \((a, b)\) to satisfy \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), \(a\) must be of the form \(k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The loop in `func_15()` effectively counts the number of such valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in the problem) and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `i`.
   - The condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) is used to ensure that the loop does not run unnecessarily, as it would not contribute to the count of valid pairs beyond this point.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, returning the correct result of 1.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example, and the logic appears to be consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The input and output handling is also correct, and the optimization in the loop is appropriate for the problem constraints.

**Correctness: **True****

However, there is a minor issue in the loop condition of `func_15()`. The condition should be \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) and not \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) and \(i \le m\). The loop should terminate when \(i \cdot i > n + i\) or when `i` exceeds `m`, whichever comes first. This is a subtle but important detail to ensure the loop runs correctly for all test cases.

### Corrected Function 15:
```python
#Function 15:
#State of the program right before the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

With this correction, the program is fully correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

**Correctness: **True** (with the minor correction mentioned)**
