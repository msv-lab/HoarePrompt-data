Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_15` is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. However, the logic within `func_15` does not correctly implement the required conditions. Specifically, the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not correctly checked.

The loop in `func_15`:
```python
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
    ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
    i += 1
```
does not ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it seems to be counting something else entirely.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`. The valid pairs should be `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, but the function `func_15` will not correctly count these pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
