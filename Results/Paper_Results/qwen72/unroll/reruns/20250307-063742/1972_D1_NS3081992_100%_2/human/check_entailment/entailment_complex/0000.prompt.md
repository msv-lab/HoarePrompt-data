Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers read from a line of space-separated input from stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any arguments. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a part of the line read from standard input, after splitting the line by whitespace and converting each part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of integers is returned, which represents the converted parts of the input line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows_number is a non-negative integer.
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, where `rows_number` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a string of integers separated by whitespace. It then splits the string into individual parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Function 8:

def func_10():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that the user inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned the integer input by the user, and no other state changes occur.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_11():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings that are the result of splitting the input provided by the user on whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input has been processed and a list of strings is available for further use.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is 1000000000, and the length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` remains unchanged, `processing` has some elements set to 1 and then reset to 0, `da` remains unchanged, `rank` remains unchanged, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value returned by `func_12` for the elements in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for the elements in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The `rank[da - 1]` is updated to this returned value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` that is present in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes the elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and returns the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to this final returned value. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, while `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the end of the function.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a), where 'a' is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= n.
    #State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and b is not equal to 0.
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns the value of `y` as it was returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, the value of `x - a // b * y` where `x` is also returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, and the value of `g` as it was returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the first value from the recursive call minus the integer division of `a` by `b` times the second value from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: a remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, k is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, k is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m, and k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `m + 1` or `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the value of `i` before the loop terminates.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or `i` is `m + 1` if that condition is not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7`. The function then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on the output of `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations and `func_15()` to generate the result for each iteration.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and for each iteration, `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed on a new line. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It prints the result of `func_15()` for a number of iterations determined by the output of `func_10()`. Each result is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value. The state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.
