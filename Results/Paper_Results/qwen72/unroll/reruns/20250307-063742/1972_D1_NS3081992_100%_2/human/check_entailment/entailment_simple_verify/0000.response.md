Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The loop in `func_15`:
```python
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
    ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
    i += 1
```
is not designed to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). Instead, it appears to be counting the number of times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the function would need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not do this, and thus, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
