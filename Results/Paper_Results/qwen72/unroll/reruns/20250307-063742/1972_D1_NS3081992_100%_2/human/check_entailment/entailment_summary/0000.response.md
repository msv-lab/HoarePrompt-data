### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions:
     - `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function uses a loop to iterate over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in this context) and calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `b` using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`, and the result is accumulated in `ans`.
   - The function returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - `func_16()` iterates `t` times (the number of test cases) and prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
- The function `func_15` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The loop in `func_15` iterates over possible values of `b` (denoted as `i` in the function) and calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `b`.
- The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be simplified to:
  - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
  - This implies `a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b`.
  - Since `gcd(a, b)` divides both `a` and `b`, `a` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b) - b`.
- The function uses the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. This formula is derived from the condition that `a` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b) - b`, and it correctly counts the number of valid `a` values for each `b`.

### Analysis of `func_16`:
- `func_16` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_15()` for each test case and printing the result.
- This function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- The functions `func_15` and `func_16` together correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
- The input and output handling is also correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
