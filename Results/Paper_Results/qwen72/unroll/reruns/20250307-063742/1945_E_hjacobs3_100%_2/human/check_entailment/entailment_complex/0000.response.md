Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Permutation**: The program attempts to use binary search on an unsorted permutation. Binary search is typically used on sorted arrays, but the problem allows for up to two swaps to make the array suitable for binary search.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n` (the length of the array).
   - **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `r - l` is 1. Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and adjusts `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array. If not, it prints 1 and returns a list of two indices to swap. If `l` is the index of `find`, it prints 0.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function returns a list of two indices to swap if `l` is not the index of `find`. This means it tries to swap the element at `l` with the element at the index of `find` to ensure that `find` is at the correct position after the binary search.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the indices to swap if needed. This matches the problem's requirement to output the number of operations and the indices involved in the swaps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `find` is already at the correct position by printing 0 and not performing any swaps.
   - It also handles the case where `find` is not at the correct position by performing one swap.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Indexing**: The binary search loop uses 0-based indexing, but the problem requires 1-based indexing for the output. The function correctly converts the indices to 1-based when printing the swaps.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a list of strings for the indices to swap, but it does not return anything when no swaps are needed. This is not consistent with the problem's requirement to output the number of operations and the indices involved in the swaps.

Given these points, the program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the return value when no swaps are needed. The function should return an empty list when no swaps are needed to ensure consistency.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the function should return an empty list when no swaps are needed:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
        return []
```

This ensures that the function always returns a list, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
