Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of rearranging a permutation to allow a binary search to find a specific value `x`. However, there are a few issues with the program that affect its correctness:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search variables `l` and `r` are initialized as `0` and `n` respectively. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that `l` should be initialized to `1` and `r` to `n + 1`. This discrepancy means that the binary search will not operate correctly over the 1-based index range.

2. **Return Value and Output**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps. However, the function prints the number of swaps directly and returns the indices as a list of strings. This is not consistent with the problem's requirement, which expects the number of swaps to be printed first, followed by the swap indices.

3. **Handling of Correct Position**: The function checks if `l` (the index found by binary search) is equal to the index of `find` in the array. However, this check is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, while the problem requires a 1-based index. Additionally, the binary search logic itself is flawed due to the incorrect initialization of `l` and `r`.

4. **Output Format**: The function should print the number of swaps and then the swap indices, but it only prints the number of swaps and returns the indices. This means that the main loop will not print the indices correctly.

5. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not actually perform the swaps on the array. It only returns the indices where the swaps should be performed. The problem requires the program to output the number of swaps and the swap indices, but it does not need to modify the array in place.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search logic is flawed, and the output format is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
