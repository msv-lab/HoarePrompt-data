Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array` if `find` exists in `array`. If `l` (the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`) is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1` and returns the list. If `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `0` and does not return anything. **
