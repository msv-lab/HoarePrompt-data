Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` should be `1` and `n + 1` respectively, as specified in the problem statement. The program initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n`, which can lead to incorrect results because the binary search algorithm is designed to work with 1-based indexing, not 0-based indexing.

2. **Swap Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find the correct position. However, the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps, which can lead to incorrect results in cases where a single swap is insufficient.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not in line with the problem statement. According to the problem, the number of swaps should be printed first, followed by the swap operations on separate lines. The current implementation prints the number of swaps inside the function, which is not the correct approach.

Let's analyze the provided test case to further validate the original assessment:

**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output**:
```
1
1 5
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `array = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`
   - `find = 1`
   - `n = 5`
   - `l = 0`, `r = 5`

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `mid = (0 + 5) // 2 = 2`
   - `array[mid] = 4` (which is greater than `find = 1`)
   - `r = mid = 2`

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `mid = (0 + 2) // 2 = 1`
   - `array[mid] = 5` (which is greater than `find = 1`)
   - `r = mid = 1`

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - `mid = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `array[mid] = 3` (which is greater than `find = 1`)
   - `r = mid = 0`

5. **End of Loop**:
   - `r - l = 1`, so the loop ends.
   - `l = 0`, `array[l] = 3`
   - `array.index(find) = 4` (1-based index is 5)

6. **Swap Operation**:
   - The program performs a single swap between `l + 1 = 1` and `array.index(find) + 1 = 5`.
   - After the swap, `array = [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]`.

7. **Binary Search After Swap**:
   - The binary search would now find `l = 0` (1-based index is 1), which is correct for `find = 1`.

However, the problem statement requires that the binary search should work correctly after no more than 2 swaps. In this case, a single swap is insufficient because the array is still not in a state where the binary search will always find the correct position. The correct solution would require two swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search works correctly.

**Correct Solution**:
- The correct solution would involve:
  - Initializing `l` and `r` to `1` and `n + 1` respectively.
  - Performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
  - Printing the number of swaps and the swap operations in the correct format.

Given the issues identified and the test case provided, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
