### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`, which is correct for a 0-based index array.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions `l = mid` and `r = mid` are correct for the binary search.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program checks if `l` is the correct index for `x` using `array.index(find)`.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it returns the indices to be swapped.
   - However, the program only handles the case where one swap is needed. The problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, but the program does not account for scenarios where more than one swap is necessary.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where no swaps are needed or where 2 swaps are needed.
   - Specifically, the function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices to be swapped, but it only prints the number of operations and returns the indices for one swap. This is a significant issue because the output format is incorrect and incomplete.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program and the logic of the binary search.
- The annotations also correctly identify that the function returns the indices to be swapped if `l` is not the correct index for `x`.
- However, the annotations do not address the fact that the program only handles one swap, which is a critical flaw given the problem's requirement for up to 2 swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it only handles the case where one swap is needed, but the problem requires handling up to 2 swaps. Additionally, the program does not correctly print the number of operations for each test case, which is a requirement of the problem.

Final: **False**
