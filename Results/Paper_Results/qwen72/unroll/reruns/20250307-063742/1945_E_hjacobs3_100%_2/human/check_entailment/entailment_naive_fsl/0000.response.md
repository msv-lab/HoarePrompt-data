Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it performs the binary search and the swap operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the binary search and the swap operations as described in the problem statement.

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed incorrectly. The initial values of `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, but the problem statement specifies that `l` and `r` should be `1` and `n + 1` respectively. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Swap Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find the correct position. However, the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not in line with the problem statement. The number of swaps should be printed first, followed by the swap operations on separate lines.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output**:
```
1
1 5
```

In this case, the program only performs one swap, which is insufficient to ensure that the binary search will find the correct position for `x = 1`. The correct solution would require two swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search works correctly.
