Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignments: `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to the value of `n`.
