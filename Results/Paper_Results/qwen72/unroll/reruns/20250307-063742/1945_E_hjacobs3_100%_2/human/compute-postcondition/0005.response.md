The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
- The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r`:
  - `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`.
  - `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
  - The current value of `l` is not the index of `find` in the array.
- However, these variables and their values do not affect the `print` statement, as the statement is only printing the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
