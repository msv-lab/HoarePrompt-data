Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is indeed incorrect. The problem statement specifies that `l` and `r` should be initialized to `1` and `n + 1` respectively, but the program initializes them to `0` and `n`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results, especially when the index `l` or `r` is used to access the array, as Python lists are 0-indexed.
   - Additionally, the binary search loop should terminate when `r - l == 1`, but the program uses `r - l > 1`. This means that the loop will not terminate correctly for some cases, leading to potential off-by-one errors.

2. **Swap Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find the correct position. However, the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps, which can lead to incorrect results in cases where a single swap is insufficient.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not in line with the problem statement. The number of swaps should be printed first, followed by the swap operations on separate lines. The current implementation prints the number of swaps within the function, which is not the correct approach.

Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues using the provided test case:

**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output**:
```
1
1 5
```

**Analysis**:
- The binary search is performed with `l = 0` and `r = 5`. The first iteration sets `mid = 2` (since `(0 + 5) // 2 = 2`), and `array[2] = 4` which is greater than `1`, so `r` is set to `2`.
- The second iteration sets `mid = 1` (since `(0 + 2) // 2 = 1`), and `array[1] = 5` which is greater than `1`, so `r` is set to `1`.
- The loop terminates because `r - l == 1`.
- The program checks if `l` (which is `0`) is equal to the index of `1` in the array (which is `4`). Since they are not equal, it prints `1` and returns the swap operation `[1, 5]`.

However, this single swap is insufficient to ensure that the binary search will find the correct position for `x = 1`. The correct solution would require two swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search works correctly.

**Corrected Approach**:
- Initialize `l` and `r` to `1` and `n + 1` respectively.
- Perform the binary search correctly, ensuring the loop terminates when `r - l == 1`.
- If the binary search does not find the correct position, perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search will work correctly.
- Print the number of swaps and the swap operations in the correct format.

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues with binary search initialization, the number of swaps allowed, and the output format. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program meets the problem requirements.
