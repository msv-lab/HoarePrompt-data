Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`.
- `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
- `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` is the index of `find` in the `array`. This means that `array[l]` is equal to `find`.
   - `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`. Since `l` is the index of `find`, `r` must be `l + 1` (assuming the array is sorted and there is at least one element greater than `find`).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet is `print(0)`.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `0`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`.

Output: **0**
