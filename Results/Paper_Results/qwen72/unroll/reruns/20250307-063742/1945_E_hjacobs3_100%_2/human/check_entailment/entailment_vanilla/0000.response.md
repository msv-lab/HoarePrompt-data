Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases, each with a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to be found.
   - The permutation `p` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the number of operations `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 2) and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` to find the position `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm is as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
     - While `r - l > 1`:
       - Calculate `mid = (l + r) // 2`.
       - If `p[mid] <= x`, set `l = mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `r = mid`.
     - The loop ends when `r - l = 1`.

4. **Swapping Operations:**
   - Before running the binary search, you can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search will find `x` at position `l`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function:**
   - The function `func_1(array, find)` performs the binary search.
   - It initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - It calculates `mid` and updates `l` or `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is the correct index for `x` by comparing `l` with `array.index(find)`.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints `1` and returns the indices to be swapped.
   - If `l` is the correct index, it prints `0`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped for each test case.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`, which is correct for a 0-based index array.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions `l = mid` and `r = mid` are correct for the binary search.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program checks if `l` is the correct index for `x` using `array.index(find)`.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it returns the indices to be swapped.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. The problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, but the program only handles one swap.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where no swaps are needed or where 2 swaps are needed.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only handles the case where one swap is needed, but the problem requires handling up to 2 swaps. Additionally, the program does not correctly print the number of operations for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
