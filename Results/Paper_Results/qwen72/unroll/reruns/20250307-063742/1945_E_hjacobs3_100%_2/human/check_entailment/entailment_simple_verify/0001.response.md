### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`, which is correct for a 0-based index array.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct.
   - The update conditions `l = mid` and `r = mid` are correct for the binary search.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program checks if `l` is the correct index for `x` using `array.index(find)`.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it returns the indices to be swapped.
   - However, the program only handles the case where one swap is needed. The problem statement clearly allows for up to 2 swaps, and the program does not account for this. This is a significant oversight.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where no swaps are needed or where 2 swaps are needed.
   - The program should print the number of operations (0, 1, or 2) and the indices to be swapped for each test case.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State before function call:**
  - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
  - `find` is an integer such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`.

- **Function `func_1` behavior:**
  - The binary search correctly finds the largest index `l` such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`.
  - If `l` is not the index of `find`, the program prints `1` and returns the indices to be swapped.
  - If `l` is the index of `find`, the program prints `0`.

- **State after function call:**
  - The program prints the result of the function call, which is the indices to be swapped if `l` is not the correct index.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it only handles the case where one swap is needed, but the problem requires handling up to 2 swaps. Additionally, the program does not correctly print the number of operations for each test case, which is a critical part of the output format.

Final: **False**
