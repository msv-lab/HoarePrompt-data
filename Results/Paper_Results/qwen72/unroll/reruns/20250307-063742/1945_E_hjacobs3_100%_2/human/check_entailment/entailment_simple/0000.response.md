### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search on Permutation**:
   - The problem involves performing a binary search on a permutation to find the index of a given number `x`. Normally, binary search requires a sorted array, but here, the array is a permutation, which is not sorted.
   - The goal is to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search can correctly find the position of `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a permutation `array` and a number `find` to be found.
   - It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n` (the length of the array).
   - It then performs a binary search loop:
     - If `r - l > 1`, it calculates the midpoint `mid`.
     - If `array[mid] <= find`, it updates `l` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `r` to `mid`.
   - After the loop, `l` should be the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` should be the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`.

3. **Swapping Elements**:
   - After the binary search, the function checks if `l` is the correct index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the string representations of `l + 1` and the index of `find` in the array plus 1. This indicates that one swap is needed to move `find` to the correct position.
   - If `l` is the correct index, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search**:
   - The binary search logic is correct for a sorted array, but since the array is a permutation, the binary search will not necessarily find the correct index without swaps.
   - The function correctly identifies the need for a swap if the binary search does not find the correct index.

5. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies the indices to swap to move `find` to the correct position.
   - However, the function only performs one swap, which is not always sufficient to ensure the binary search works correctly. The problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps, and the function should be designed to handle cases where two swaps are necessary.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the number of swaps and returns the indices of the swaps in the correct format as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is not fully correct because it only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient to ensure the binary search works correctly for all permutations. The problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps, and the function should be designed to handle cases where two swaps are necessary.

### Correctness:
**False**
