Output State: **`l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`.**

### Explanation:
The loop is a binary search that operates on a sorted list `array`. It adjusts the indices `l` and `r` to narrow down the search range until `r - l` is no longer greater than 1. 

- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, the loop updates `l` to `mid`, meaning that `l` is moved to the right.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, the loop updates `r` to `mid`, meaning that `r` is moved to the left.

When the loop terminates, `l` will be the largest index where `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the smallest index where `array[r]` is greater than `find`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `l` and `r` until they converge to the boundary where the condition changes.
