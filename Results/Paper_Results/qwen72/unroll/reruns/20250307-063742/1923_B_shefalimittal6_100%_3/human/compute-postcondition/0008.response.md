Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of positive integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of non-zero integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters (unique and sorted in ascending order), and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The function attempts to eliminate all monsters by firing bullets at them in order of their proximity to the origin (0). If at any point a monster is at the same distance from the origin as the current `distance` (which increments each second), the function returns `False`. If all monsters are eliminated, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of non-positive integers representing the health of the monsters, and `distance` is the number of seconds it took to eliminate all monsters. **
