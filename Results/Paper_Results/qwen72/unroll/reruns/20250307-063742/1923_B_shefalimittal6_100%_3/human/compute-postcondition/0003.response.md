The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided indicates that there is an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4, which is likely used within the function. Since the output details are not provided, I cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the given information, I can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates with an integer `t` within the range 1 to 30,000. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not described.**
