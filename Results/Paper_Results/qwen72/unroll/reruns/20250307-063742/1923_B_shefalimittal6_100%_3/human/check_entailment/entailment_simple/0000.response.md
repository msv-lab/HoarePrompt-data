### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a player at point 0 on a line, with `n` monsters at various positions `x_i` and health `a_i`.
   - Each second, the player can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
   - Monsters move 1 point closer to the player each second.
   - The player loses if any monster reaches point 0.
   - The goal is to determine if the player can kill all monsters before any of them reach point 0.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, x, k)`**:
     - The function takes three parameters: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), and `k` (number of bullets per second).
     - It first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
     - It then iterates through the sorted indices, firing bullets at the monsters in order of their distance from the player.
     - The function checks if the current monster's position is equal to the distance the player has already covered (`distance`). If so, it returns `False` because the monster has reached the player.
     - It continues to fire bullets at the current monster until it is either dead or the player has no more bullets to fire in the current second.
     - The `distance` is incremented at the end of each second.
     - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the player, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - The function correctly handles the sorting of monsters based on their distance from the player.
   - It ensures that the player fires bullets at the closest monsters first, which is a crucial strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the player.
   - The function correctly checks if a monster has reached the player by comparing the current `distance` with the monster's position.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the player can fire multiple bullets at a single monster in one second.

4. **Function 2:**
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, the health of the monsters `a`, and their positions `x`.
     - It calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints 'YES' if the function returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem.
   - It handles the input and output format as required.
   - The strategy of targeting the closest monsters first is sound and ensures that the player can survive if it is possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description and constraints.
