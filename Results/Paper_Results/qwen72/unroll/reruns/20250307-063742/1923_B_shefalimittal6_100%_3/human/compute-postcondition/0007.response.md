The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of the monsters, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and each element in `x` is unique and sorted in ascending order. After executing the function body, the function always returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a list of positive integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of non-zero integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters (unique and sorted in ascending order), and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. It always returns `True`.**
