Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` have been read from user input. The function `func_1(a, x, k)` has been called for each iteration, and the output of the loop will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' messages, one for each iteration, based on the return value of `func_1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
