Output State: **`pos` is the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is the number of seconds it took to eliminate all monsters, and `a` is a list of non-positive integers representing the health of the monsters after all shots have been fired.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues until all monsters are eliminated, which is indicated by `pos` reaching the length of `sorted_indices`.
- `distance` tracks the number of seconds that have passed, incrementing by 1 each time a round of shots is fired.
- `a` will contain non-positive integers after the loop, as each monster's health is reduced by the shots fired, and once a monster's health reaches 0, it is considered eliminated.
