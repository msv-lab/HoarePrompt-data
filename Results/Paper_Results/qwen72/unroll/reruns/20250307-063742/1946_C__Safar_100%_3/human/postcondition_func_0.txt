The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. The function then performs a binary search to determine the maximum value `r` that satisfies a certain condition (checked by the `check` function, which is not provided in the code). Finally, the function prints the value of `r`, which is the integer division of `n` by `k` (i.e., `n // k`). The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the adjacency list `g` is populated with the connections between vertices, and the variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.
