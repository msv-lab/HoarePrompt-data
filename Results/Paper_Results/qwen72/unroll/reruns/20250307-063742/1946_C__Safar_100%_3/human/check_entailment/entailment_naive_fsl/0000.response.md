Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is a star graph (a tree where one vertex is connected to all other vertices, and no other edges exist). In such a case, the `check` function will not behave as expected, leading to incorrect results.

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
The tree is a star graph with 4 vertices, and we need to remove 1 edge. The correct answer should be 2, as we can remove any edge to split the tree into two components of size 2. However, the `check` function will not correctly count the sizes of the components when removing an edge from a star graph, leading to an incorrect result.
