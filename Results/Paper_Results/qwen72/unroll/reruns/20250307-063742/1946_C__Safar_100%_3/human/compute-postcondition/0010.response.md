The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is a positive integer. The function also implicitly accepts a parameter `g`, which is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each key is a vertex and each value is a list of adjacent vertices. The function returns `True` in Case_1 and `False` in Case_2. Since the exact conditions for these cases are not provided, we can only describe the general behavior based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `A` and a dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of a tree. It returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case, but the specific conditions for these cases are not provided.**
