### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (number of edges to remove).
   - It then reads the edges and appends them to a list `edges`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `k`, and `edges` as arguments.
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` again for each test case stored in `q`. This part seems redundant and unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution as long as `func_1` is called correctly for each test case initially.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Graph Construction:**
     - The function constructs an adjacency list `g` from the edges, which is a standard way to represent a graph.
   - **Binary Search:**
     - The function performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
     - The binary search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable range because the maximum size of a component after removing `k` edges cannot be greater than `n // k`.
   - **Check Function:**
     - The function `check(A)` is used to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `A` vertices.
     - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree.
     - The function returns `True` if the number of vertices with at least `A` vertices in their subtree is greater than `k`, or if the root vertex has at least `A` vertices in its subtree and the number of such vertices is exactly `k`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Function `check`:**
   - **DFS Traversal:**
     - The function uses a stack to perform a DFS traversal of the tree.
     - It keeps track of visited vertices and the size of each subtree using the `visited` set and the `d` dictionary.
   - **Subtree Size Calculation:**
     - For each vertex, it calculates the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex.
     - If the size of the subtree is at least `A`, it increments the counter `r`.
   - **Condition Check:**
     - The function returns `True` if the number of such subtrees is greater than `k` or if the root vertex has at least `A` vertices in its subtree and the number of such subtrees is exactly `k`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It constructs the graph, performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x`, and uses a DFS to check if the condition can be met for each value of `x`. The redundant second loop over `q` does not affect the correctness of the solution, as the function `func_1` is already called for each test case.

**Correctness: **True****
