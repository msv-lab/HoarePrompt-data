Postcondition: **`stack` is an empty list, `visited` is a set containing all vertices of the tree, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the value is the number of vertices in the subtree rooted at that vertex (excluding the parent), `r` is the number of vertices in the tree that have at least `A` vertices in their subtree, and either `r` is less than or equal to `k` or (`d[1]` is less than `A` and `r` is not equal to `k`).**
