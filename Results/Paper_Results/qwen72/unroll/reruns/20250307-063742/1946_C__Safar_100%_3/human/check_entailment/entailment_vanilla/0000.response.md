Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Description:
- We are given a tree with \( n \) vertices.
- We need to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree.
- The goal is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(n, k, edges)`**
   - **Graph Construction**: The function constructs an adjacency list `g` for the tree.
   - **Binary Search Setup**: It initializes `l` and `r` for a binary search to find the maximum \( x \). The range is from 1 to \( n // k \), which is a reasonable upper bound because if we remove \( k \) edges, we can have at most \( k + 1 \) components, and each component must have at least \( x \) vertices.
   - **Binary Search Loop**: The loop performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that `check(mid)` returns `True`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the maximum \( x \) found.

2. **Function 2: `check(A)`**
   - **DFS Setup**: The function uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - **Visited Set and Dictionary**: It maintains a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and a dictionary `d` to store the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
   - **DFS Loop**: The loop processes nodes in the stack:
     - If a node `x` is not visited, it marks it as visited and initializes its subtree size to 1.
     - It then explores all its children (nodes connected by edges) that are not the parent `p`.
     - If a node `x` is already visited, it checks the size of its subtree:
       - If the size is at least \( A \), it increments the count `r`.
       - Otherwise, it adds the size of the subtree to the parent's subtree size.
     - The loop continues until the stack is empty.
   - **Check Condition**: The function returns `True` if the number of components with at least \( A \) vertices is greater than \( k \) or if the root's subtree size is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph is correctly constructed using an adjacency list.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search setup is correct. The range from 1 to \( n // k \) is appropriate.
3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS implementation is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:
     - The global variable `g` is used in `check(A)`, but it should be passed as a parameter to `check(A)` to avoid issues with multiple test cases.
     - The condition `if d[x] >= A` should be `if d[x] >= A and r < k` to ensure that we only count valid components up to \( k \).
     - The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)` should be `if r == k and d[1] >= A` to ensure that exactly \( k \) edges are removed and the root's subtree size is at least \( A \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // (k + 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g, n, k):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

def check(A, g, n, k):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while stack:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A and r < k:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
    return r == k and d[1] >= A
```

### Final Verdict:
The original program has a few logical issues that need to be corrected. After making the necessary corrections, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
