Functionality: ** The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and a dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of a tree. It returns `True` if the number of vertices in the tree that have at least `A` vertices in their subtree is greater than `k`, or if the root vertex (1) has at least `A` vertices in its subtree and the number of such vertices is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the `stack` is an empty list, `visited` is a set containing all vertices of the tree, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the value is the number of vertices in the subtree rooted at that vertex (excluding the parent), and `r` is the number of vertices in the tree that have at least `A` vertices in their subtree. **
