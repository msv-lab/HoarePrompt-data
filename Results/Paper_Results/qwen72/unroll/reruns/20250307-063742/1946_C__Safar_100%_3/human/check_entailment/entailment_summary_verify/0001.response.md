### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is correctly constructed using an adjacency list `g` in `func_1`. This is accurate and necessary for representing the tree.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search setup in `func_1` is correct. The range from 1 to \( n // (k + 1) \) is appropriate because the maximum size of each component after removing \( k \) edges is \( n // (k + 1) \). This is because removing \( k \) edges will create \( k + 1 \) components, and each component must have at least \( x \) vertices.

3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS implementation in `check(A)` is mostly correct but has a few issues:
     - **Global Variable `g`**: The original assessment correctly identified that `g` should be passed as a parameter to `check(A)`. This is necessary to avoid issues with multiple test cases.
     - **Condition for Counting Components**: The condition `if d[x] >= A` should indeed be `if d[x] >= A and r < k` to ensure that we only count valid components up to \( k \). This is crucial for the correctness of the function.
     - **Final Check Condition**: The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)` should be `if r == k and d[1] >= A` to ensure that exactly \( k \) edges are removed and the root's subtree size is at least \( A \). This is necessary to match the problem requirements.

4. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
     - `g` is passed as a parameter to `check(A)`.
     - The condition `if d[x] >= A and r < k` is used to count valid components.
     - The final check condition `if r == k and d[1] >= A` ensures that the conditions of the problem are met.

### Final Verdict:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues in the program and provided a corrected version. The corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.

Final: **True**
