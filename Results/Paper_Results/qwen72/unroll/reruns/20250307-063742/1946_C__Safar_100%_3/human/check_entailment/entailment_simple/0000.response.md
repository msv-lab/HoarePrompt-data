### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Data Structure Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads `n-1` edges to build the tree.
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list `g`, which is a list of lists. Each index `i` in `g` contains a list of vertices connected to vertex `i`.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size:**
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum possible size `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound because if you remove `k` edges, you can have at most `k+1` components, and each component must have at least `n // (k+1)` vertices.

3. **Check Function:**
   - The `check` function is used to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `A` vertices.
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree.
   - The `stack` is used to simulate the DFS, and `visited` keeps track of visited vertices.
   - The dictionary `d` stores the size of each subtree rooted at a vertex.
   - The variable `r` counts the number of subtrees that have at least `A` vertices.
   - If the root of the tree (vertex `1`) has at least `A` vertices in its subtree and `r` is equal to `k`, or if `r` is greater than `k`, the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search, the program prints the maximum value `r` (which is the result of the binary search).

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The binary search initialization is correct, setting `l` to `1` and `r` to `n // k`.
- **Binary Search Loop:**
  - The loop condition `while l <= r` is correct.
  - The midpoint calculation `mid = l + (r - l) // 2` is correct.
- **Check Function:**
  - The DFS implementation in the `check` function is correct.
  - The logic to count the number of subtrees with at least `A` vertices is correct.
  - The condition to return `True` or `False` is also correct.
- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the maximum value `r` after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. The binary search and DFS are implemented correctly, and the conditions for determining the feasibility of the solution are also correct.
