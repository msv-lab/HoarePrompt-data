Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Binary Search Range**: The binary search range for `l` and `r` is incorrect. The range should be from 1 to `n // (k + 1)` because the maximum possible size of each component after removing `k` edges is `n // (k + 1)`, not `n // k`.

2. **Check Function**: The `check` function is not correctly implemented. The function should ensure that after removing `k` edges, the remaining components have at least `A` vertices. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the removal of edges and the counting of components.

3. **Global Variable `g`**: The graph `g` is defined as a global variable inside `func_1`, but it is used in the `check` function without being passed as an argument. This can lead to issues if the `check` function is called multiple times with different graphs.

4. **Component Size Calculation**: The current implementation of the `check` function does not correctly calculate the size of the components after removing edges. It only checks the size of the current component and does not account for the total number of components formed.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Use a binary search to find the maximum possible size `x` of each component.
2. For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, check if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices.
3. Use a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of components and their sizes after removing edges.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    
    def check(A):
        def dfs(node, parent):
            size = 1
            for neighbor in g[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:
                    component_size = dfs(neighbor, node)
                    if component_size < A:
                        size += component_size
                    else:
                        nonlocal components
                        components += 1
            return size
        
        components = 0
        dfs(1, -1)
        return components <= k
    
    l = 1
    r = n // (k + 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

# Example usage:
t = 6
test_cases = [
    (5, 1, [(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]),
    (2, 1, [(1, 2)]),
    (6, 1, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]),
    (3, 1, [(1, 2), (1, 3)]),
    (8, 2, [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]),
    (6, 2, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
]

for n, k, edges in test_cases:
    func_1(n, k, edges)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph `g` is constructed using adjacency lists.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed on the range `[1, n // (k + 1)]`.
3. **DFS for Component Size Calculation**: The `dfs` function calculates the size of each component. If a component size is less than `A`, it is added to the current component. If it is at least `A`, it is counted as a separate component.
4. **Check Function**: The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to count the number of components of size at least `A` and returns `True` if the number of such components is at most `k`.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
