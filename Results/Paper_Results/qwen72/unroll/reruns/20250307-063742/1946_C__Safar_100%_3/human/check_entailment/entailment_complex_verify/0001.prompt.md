You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Description:
- We are given a tree with \( n \) vertices.
- We need to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree.
- The goal is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(n, k, edges)`**
   - **Graph Construction**: The function constructs an adjacency list `g` for the tree.
   - **Binary Search Setup**: It initializes `l` and `r` for a binary search to find the maximum \( x \). The range is from 1 to \( n // k \), which is a reasonable upper bound because if we remove \( k \) edges, we can have at most \( k + 1 \) components, and each component must have at least \( x \) vertices.
   - **Binary Search Loop**: The loop performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that `check(mid)` returns `True`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the maximum \( x \) found.

2. **Function 2: `check(A)`**
   - **DFS Setup**: The function uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - **Visited Set and Dictionary**: It maintains a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and a dictionary `d` to store the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
   - **DFS Loop**: The loop processes nodes in the stack:
     - If a node `x` is not visited, it marks it as visited and initializes its subtree size to 1.
     - It then explores all its children (nodes connected by edges) that are not the parent `p`.
     - If a node `x` is already visited, it checks the size of its subtree:
       - If the size is at least \( A \), it increments the count `r`.
       - Otherwise, it adds the size of the subtree to the parent's subtree size.
     - The loop continues until the stack is empty.
   - **Check Condition**: The function returns `True` if the number of components with at least \( A \) vertices is greater than \( k \) or if the root's subtree size is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph is correctly constructed using an adjacency list.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search setup is correct. The range from 1 to \( n // k \) is appropriate.
3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS implementation is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:
     - The global variable `g` is used in `check(A)`, but it should be passed as a parameter to `check(A)` to avoid issues with multiple test cases.
     - The condition `if d[x] >= A` should be `if d[x] >= A and r < k` to ensure that we only count valid components up to \( k \).
     - The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)` should be `if r == k and d[1] >= A` to ensure that exactly \( k \) edges are removed and the root's subtree size is at least \( A \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // (k + 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g, n, k):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

def check(A, g, n, k):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while stack:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A and r < k:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
    return r == k and d[1] >= A
```

### Final Verdict:
The original program has a few logical issues that need to be corrected. After making the necessary corrections, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
