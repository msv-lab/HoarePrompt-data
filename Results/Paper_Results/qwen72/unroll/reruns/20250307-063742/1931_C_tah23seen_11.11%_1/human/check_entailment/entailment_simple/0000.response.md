Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1` starts by checking if the array is a palindrome. It does this by moving two pointers `i` and `j` from the start and end of the array towards the center, respectively. If `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. If the loop completes with `i > j`, it means the array is a palindrome, and the function correctly returns `0` because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.

3. **Non-Palindrome Handling**:
   - After breaking out of the first loop, the function then checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. If so, it increments `i` to skip over consecutive equal elements. This is intended to find the first non-equal pair of elements from the start.
   - The function then checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If `j` is not the last index, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the cost of the operation to make all elements between `i` and `j` equal.
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is the cost of the operation to make all elements between `i` and `j` equal.

4. **Issues**:
   - The second loop `while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]: i += 1` is problematic because it does not handle the case where `i` reaches `j` or `j - 1`. If `i` reaches `j`, the loop will try to access `arr[j + 1]`, which is out of bounds.
   - The final return statement `return j - i` is incorrect because it should return `j - i + 1` to account for the inclusive range of indices.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - The second loop should be modified to ensure it does not go out of bounds.
   - The final return statement should be `j - i + 1` to correctly calculate the cost.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
