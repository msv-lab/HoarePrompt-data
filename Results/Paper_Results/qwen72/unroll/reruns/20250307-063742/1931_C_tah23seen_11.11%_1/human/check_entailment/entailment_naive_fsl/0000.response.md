Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements, but the optimal solution involves setting all elements to a value that is not at the ends. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to set all elements to `2`, which would cost `3` burles (by setting elements at indices `1` to `3` to `2`). However, the program will return `4` burles, which is incorrect. The program only considers the cost of setting elements to the value at the ends, which is not always the optimal solution.
