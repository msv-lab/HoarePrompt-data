Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1.**

The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0. The variable `j` is now assigned the value of the length of `arr` minus 1. This means `j` is the index of the last element in the list `arr`.
