Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying the operation of assigning a value to a subarray. However, the function's logic is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

1. **Palindrome Check**: The function correctly identifies if the array is a palindrome and returns 0 if it is, as no operation is needed to make all elements equal in a palindrome array.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Pair**: The function attempts to find the first pair of indices `i` and `j` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. This is a good starting point, but the logic after this is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - If the array is not a palindrome, the function should find the minimum cost to make all elements equal. The current logic only checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and returns `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index, or `j - i` if `j` is the last index. This does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal.
   - The function does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal to the most frequent element in the array, which would generally be the cheapest option.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The optimal solution involves finding the most frequent element in the array and calculating the cost to make all elements equal to this value. The cost would be the length of the subarray that needs to be modified.
   - If the array is already all the same value, the cost is 0.
   - If the array is not a palindrome and has multiple distinct values, the function should find the most frequent value and calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this value.

Given these points, the function `func_1` is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
