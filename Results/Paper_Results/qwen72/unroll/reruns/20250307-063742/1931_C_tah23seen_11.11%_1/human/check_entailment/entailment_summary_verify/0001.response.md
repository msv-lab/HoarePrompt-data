### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire array is already equal (returns 0).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (returns 0).

2. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program's logic to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal, not just the cost to make a subarray equal.
   - The program assumes that if `j` is not the last index, the cost is `j - i + 1`. This assumption is incorrect because it does not consider the most frequent element in the array.
   - The correct approach should be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element. The cost would be `n - max_count`, where `max_count` is the count of the most frequent element.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array is a palindrome and then find the first pair of indices where the elements are not equal. This is not the correct approach for the problem.
- The function returns `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index, and `j - i` if `j` is the last index. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the most frequent element in the array.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves:
  - Finding the most frequent element in the array.
  - Calculating the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
  - This can be done by counting the occurrences of each element and selecting the element with the maximum count. The cost would then be `n - max_count`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It fails to consider the most frequent element and the cost to make all elements equal to this element.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Final: **False**
