The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** The program returns 0.
- **Case_2:** The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1, where `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
- **Case_3:** The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1 and `i` is undefined or not provided in the initial state.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 (if `j` is not the last index of `arr`), or the difference between `j` and `i` (if `j` is the last index of `arr` and `i` is undefined or not provided).**
