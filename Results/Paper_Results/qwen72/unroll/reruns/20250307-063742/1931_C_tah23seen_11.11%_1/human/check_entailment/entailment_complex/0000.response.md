Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1` starts by checking if the array is a palindrome. It does this by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of the array, respectively, and moving them towards the center. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. If it finds a pair where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Palindrome Result**: If the array is a palindrome, the function returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.

4. **Non-Palindrome Handling**: If the array is not a palindrome, the function then tries to find the first pair of indices `i` and `j` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. It does this by incrementing `i` while `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Return Values**:
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns `j - i + 1`. This is the correct number of burles needed to make the elements from `i` to `j` equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, it returns `j - i`. This is incorrect because the function should return `j - i + 1` to account for the inclusive range of indices.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is a palindrome.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array has only one element.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the case where `j` is the last index of the array. It should return `j - i + 1` instead of `j - i`.

Given the above reasoning, the function is incorrect because it does not return the correct value in the case where `j` is the last index of the array.

Correctness: **False**
