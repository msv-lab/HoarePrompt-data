To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The program state right before the loop includes the following:

- The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome.
- Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

For the loop to execute, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. However, the current state does not provide any specific information about the elements of `arr` or the values of `i` and `j` that would ensure this condition is met. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**
