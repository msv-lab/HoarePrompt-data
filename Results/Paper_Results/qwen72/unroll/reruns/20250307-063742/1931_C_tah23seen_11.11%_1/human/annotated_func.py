#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop will not terminate based on the given condition and code.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1. Since `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1, the exact value of `j - i + 1` depends on the specific values of `i` and `j`.
    #State: The loop will not terminate based on the given condition and code, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is undefined or not provided in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks if the list is a palindrome. If the list is a palindrome, it returns 0. If the list is not a palindrome, it finds the first pair of indices `i` and `j` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. It then returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1, if `j` is not the last index of the list. If `j` is the last index of the list, it returns the difference between `j` and `i`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
