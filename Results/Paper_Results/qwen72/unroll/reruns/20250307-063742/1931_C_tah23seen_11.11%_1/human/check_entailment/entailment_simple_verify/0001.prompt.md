You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation at most once: select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1) burles`.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal and move the pointers inward.
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means the entire array is already equal, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i + 1` are equal, it continues moving the pointer `i` inward.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` inclusive (`j - i + 1`).
   - Otherwise, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (`j - i`).

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire array is already equal (returns 0).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (returns 0).

2. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - The logic to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal is correct.
   - However, the logic to determine the minimum cost to make the array equal is flawed:
     - The program assumes that if `j` is not the last index, the cost is `j - i + 1`.
     - This is not always correct. The correct approach should be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Finding the most frequent element in the array.
     - Calculating the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
     - This can be done by counting the occurrences of each element and selecting the element with the maximum count. The cost would then be `n - max_count`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It fails to consider the most frequent element and the cost to make all elements equal to this element.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
