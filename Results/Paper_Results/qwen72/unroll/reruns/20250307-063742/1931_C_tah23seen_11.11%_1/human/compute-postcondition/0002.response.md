To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition in the loop head: `i <= j`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is len(arr) - 1.

Let's analyze the condition:
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is len(arr) - 1, which means `j` is the last index of the list `arr`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is len(arr) - 1, the condition `i <= j` will always be true as long as `len(arr) >= 1`.

Given that `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, the length of `arr` is at least 1, which means `j` will always be 0 or greater. Therefore, `i <= j` will always be true.

Since the condition is already satisfied, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
