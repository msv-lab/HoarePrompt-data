Postcondition: **The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.**
