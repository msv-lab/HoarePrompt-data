You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop will not terminate based on the given condition and code.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1. Since `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1, the exact value of `j - i + 1` depends on the specific values of `i` and `j`.
    #State: The loop will not terminate based on the given condition and code, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is undefined or not provided in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 (if `j` is not the last index of `arr`), or the difference between `j` and `i` (if `j` is the last index of `arr` and `i` is undefined or not provided).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1. Since `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1, the exact value of `j - i + 1` depends on the specific values of `i` and `j`.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is undefined or not provided in the initial state.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
