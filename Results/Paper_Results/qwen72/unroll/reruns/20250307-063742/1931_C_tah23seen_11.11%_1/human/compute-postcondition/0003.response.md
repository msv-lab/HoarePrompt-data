Output State: **The loop will either terminate with `i` and `j` such that `i > j` if the list `arr` is a palindrome, or it will terminate with `i` and `j` at the first pair of indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` if the list is not a palindrome.**

In natural language: The loop checks if the list `arr` is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and the end, moving inward. If the list is a palindrome, the loop will continue until `i` is greater than `j`, meaning all elements have been checked and are equal. If the list is not a palindrome, the loop will stop as soon as it finds a pair of elements that do not match.
