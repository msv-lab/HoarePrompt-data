Output State: **The loop will not terminate based on the given condition and code.**

Natural Language Explanation: The provided loop condition `while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` will continue to increment `i` as long as the current element and the next element in the list `arr` are equal. However, this loop does not check for the end of the list or any other termination condition, such as `i` reaching `j` or `i` becoming greater than or equal to the length of the list. As a result, if there is a sequence of equal elements in the list, the loop will keep incrementing `i` indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop. Therefore, the loop will not terminate, and no final output state can be determined for `i` and `j` based on the given code.
