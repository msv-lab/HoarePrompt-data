Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation at most once: select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1) burles`.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal and move the pointers inward.
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means the entire array is already equal, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i + 1` are equal, it continues moving the pointer `i` inward.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` inclusive (`j - i + 1`).
   - Otherwise, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (`j - i`).

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire array is already equal (returns 0).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (returns 0).

2. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - The logic to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal is correct.
   - However, the logic to determine the minimum cost to make the array equal is flawed:
     - The program assumes that if `j` is not the last index, the cost is `j - i + 1`.
     - This is not always correct. The correct approach should be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Finding the most frequent element in the array.
     - Calculating the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
     - This can be done by counting the occurrences of each element and selecting the element with the maximum count. The cost would then be `n - max_count`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It fails to consider the most frequent element and the cost to make all elements equal to this element.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
