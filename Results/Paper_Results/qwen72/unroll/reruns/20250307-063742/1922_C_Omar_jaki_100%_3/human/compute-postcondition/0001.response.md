Output State: **t is an integer read from input; each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) cities with coordinates a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries, where each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into tokens, converts each token to an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers.**
