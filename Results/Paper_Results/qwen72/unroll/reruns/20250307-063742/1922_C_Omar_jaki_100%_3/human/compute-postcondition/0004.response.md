The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a list of cities with unique coordinates and a set of queries. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the cities, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
  - `m`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
  - `queries`: A list of tuples, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i` (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), representing the indices of the cities for which the distance between them is to be calculated.

The function returns the distances between the cities specified in each query for all test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves. It returns the distances between the cities specified in each query for all test cases.**
