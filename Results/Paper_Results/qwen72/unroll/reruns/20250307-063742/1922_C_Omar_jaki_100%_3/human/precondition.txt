t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of cities, and a is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i â‰  y_i, representing the cities between which the travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.
