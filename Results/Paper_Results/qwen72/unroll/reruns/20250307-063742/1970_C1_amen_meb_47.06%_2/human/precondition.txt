The function `accept_numbers` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should read input in the format specified: the first line contains two integers n and t (where t is always 1), followed by n-1 lines of edges, and one line with the starting node. The input should satisfy the constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
