You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5, and the tree is represented by a list of edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 \leq u, v \leq n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node u_1 is an integer such that 1 \leq u_1 \leq n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of pairs of integers that were input until an input with a different format was encountered. The tree and `n` remain unchanged, and `u_1` also remains unchanged.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains pairs of integers that were input until an input with a different format was encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes input pairs of integers until an input with a different format is encountered, and returns a list `numbers` containing the pairs of integers that were input.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `numbers` which contains pairs of integers that were input until an input with a different format was encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
