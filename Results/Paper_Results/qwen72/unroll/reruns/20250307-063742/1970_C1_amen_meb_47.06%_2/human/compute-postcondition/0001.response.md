Since the `while` loop in the given task is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the tree is represented by a list of edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `numbers` is an empty list.**
