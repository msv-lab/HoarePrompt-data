Output State: **`numbers` is a list of pairs of integers that were input until an input with a different format was encountered. The tree and `n` remain unchanged, and `u_1` also remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to read pairs of integers from the input until an input that does not consist of exactly two integers is encountered. Each valid pair of integers is appended to the `numbers` list. The initial state of the tree, `n`, and `u_1` are not modified by the loop and remain as they were initially defined.
