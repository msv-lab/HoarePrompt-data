You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Examples

Input

    3 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 1
    
    3

Output

    Ron
    
Input

    5 1
    
    1 2
    
    2 3
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    5

Output

    Hermione

- Program:
result = func_1()
Ron_co = 0
Hib_co = 0
for sublist in result:
    num_1 = sublist[0]
    num_2 = sublist[1]
    if num_1 > num_2:
        Ron_co += 1
    elif num_1 == num_2:
        continue
    else:
        Hib_co += 1
if Ron_co > Hib_co:
    print('Ron')
else:
    print('Hermione')

def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
    return numbers



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and processes pairs of integers from user input until an input with a different format is encountered. It returns a list `numbers` containing the pairs of integers that were input. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input until it encounters a line that does not have exactly two integers. This is not how the input should be handled according to the problem description. The input should be read in a structured manner, with the first line containing `n` and `t`, followed by `n-1` lines for the edges, and the last line for the starting node.

2. **Game Logic**: The program does not implement the game logic at all. It simply counts the number of times the first number in each sublist is greater than or less than the second number, which is not related to the game of moving a stone on a tree.

3. **Tree Structure**: The program does not construct the tree or handle the tree structure. The game requires understanding the tree's structure to determine the optimal moves and the winner.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. The game's outcome depends on the structure of the tree and the starting node, and the program does not account for this.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
