Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input until it encounters a line that does not have exactly two integers. This is not how the input should be handled according to the problem description. The input should be read in a structured manner, with the first line containing `n` and `t`, followed by `n-1` lines for the edges, and the last line for the starting node.

2. **Game Logic**: The program does not implement the game logic at all. It simply counts the number of times the first number in each sublist is greater than or less than the second number, which is not related to the game of moving a stone on a tree.

3. **Tree Structure**: The program does not construct the tree or handle the tree structure. The game requires understanding the tree's structure to determine the optimal moves and the winner.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. The game's outcome depends on the structure of the tree and the starting node, and the program does not account for this.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
