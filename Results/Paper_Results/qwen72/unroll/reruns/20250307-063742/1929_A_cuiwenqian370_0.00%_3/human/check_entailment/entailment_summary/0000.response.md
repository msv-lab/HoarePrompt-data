Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), after rearranging the elements of the array. The provided solution sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

However, the problem specifically asks for the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. The provided solution calculates the sum of the absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires. The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly, without taking the absolute value.

Given this, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
