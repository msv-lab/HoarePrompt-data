Reasoning:  
The program aims to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The provided function `func_1` sorts the array and then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array, as the beauty is defined by the differences between consecutive elements, not their absolute differences.

The problem description specifies that the beauty is the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`. To maximize this, the array should be sorted in descending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a descending order will be positive and maximized, leading to the highest possible sum.

However, the program creates a mirrored order, which can lead to smaller positive and larger negative differences, potentially reducing the total beauty. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the correct order to maximize beauty would be `[3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2`. The program, however, would create `[3, 1, 2]`, resulting in a beauty of `(3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 1`, which is not the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
