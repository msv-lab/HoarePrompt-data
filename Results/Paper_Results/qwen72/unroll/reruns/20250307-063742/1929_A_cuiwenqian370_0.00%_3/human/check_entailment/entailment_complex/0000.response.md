### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the array.

The given program attempts to achieve this by:
1. Sorting the array in ascending order.
2. Constructing a new array (`new_arr`) by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
3. Calculating the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

However, the approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements is not optimal for maximizing the beauty. The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty directly from the sorted array. This is because the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array will always be the largest possible difference, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

Let's break down the correct approach:
- **Sorting the array**: This ensures that the largest differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
- **Calculating the beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The given program's approach of alternating elements does not necessarily maximize the beauty, especially for arrays with a large range of values. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 100]`. The optimal arrangement is `[1, 100, 2]`, which gives a beauty of \(99 + 98 = 197\). However, the given program would arrange it as `[100, 1, 2]`, which gives a beauty of \(99 + 1 = 100\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not always produce the maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty directly from the sorted array.
