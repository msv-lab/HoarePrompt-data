Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program attempts to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is a different objective.

To maximize the beauty of the array, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the sorted array will have the smallest possible differences between consecutive elements, which will maximize the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).

The provided function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array. This approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), but rather maximizes the sum of the absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Compute the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This program correctly sorts the array and computes the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which will give the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.
