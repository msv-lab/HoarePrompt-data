The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr[i]` satisfies 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr`, which is a mirrored version of `arr`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` appears only once in `new_arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a mirrored list of `arr`, where the middle element (if `n` is odd) appears only once.**
