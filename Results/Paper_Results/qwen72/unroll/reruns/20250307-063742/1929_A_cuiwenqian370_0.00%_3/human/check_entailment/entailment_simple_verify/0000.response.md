### Reasoning

The original assessment is indeed correct in identifying that the program does not always calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
   - It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternately appending the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **State before function call**: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \le n \le 100\), and `arr` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \le arr[i] \le 10^9\).
   - **State after sorting**: `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - **State after constructing `new_arr`**: `new_arr` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and then the beginning, with the middle element (if \(n\) is odd) appearing only once.
   - **State after calculating `max_beauty`**: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The sorted array `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The program constructs `new_arr` as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
   - The beauty is calculated as:
     \[
     (4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) = 3 + (-1) + (-1) = 1
     \]
   - However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which gives a beauty of:
     \[
     (4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2
     \]
   - The program's output of 4 is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then construct a new array by alternating the largest and smallest elements. This ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the correct rearrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which gives the maximum beauty of 6.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty. The program's approach of constructing `new_arr` by alternately appending the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array does not always maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
