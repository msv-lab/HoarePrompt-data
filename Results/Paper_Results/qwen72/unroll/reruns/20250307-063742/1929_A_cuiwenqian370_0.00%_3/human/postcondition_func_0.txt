The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr`, which is constructed by sorting `arr` and then arranging its elements in a mirrored order, starting from the largest element and alternating with the smallest remaining element. If `n` is odd, the middle element appears only once in `new_arr`.
