Output State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and then the beginning, with the middle element (if `n` is odd) appearing only once.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the variable `left` will be equal to `n`, and `right` will be `-1`. The list `new_arr` will contain the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order. This means that if `n` is even, `new_arr` will contain pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of `arr` (e.g., last element, first element, second-to-last element, second element, etc.). If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will appear only once in `new_arr`, and the rest of the elements will still be in mirrored pairs.
