Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the way the `new_arr` is constructed. The function `func_1` sorts the array and then alternately appends the largest and smallest elements to `new_arr`. However, this approach does not always maximize the beauty of the array.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output is 6, because the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2` or `(1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = (-3) + 2 + (-1) = -2`, but the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, but with the largest and smallest elements alternating to maximize the absolute differences. However, the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.
