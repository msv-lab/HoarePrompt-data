To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
```
The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized, but it will start from 1 in the first iteration.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the upper bound of the range, and the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.
   - If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range `range(1, n)` will be empty.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 1** for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`i` will start from 1** in the first iteration, which is already implied by the loop statement.

### Other Variables:
- **`left` is `n`**: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`right` is `-1`**: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`new_arr` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order**: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`max_beauty` is 0**: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` will start from 1. The other variables and objects do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the end and then the beginning, with the middle element (if `n` is odd) appearing only once, `max_beauty` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
