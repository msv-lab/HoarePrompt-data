The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `left <= right`. 

Right before the loop, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `right` will always be at least 1 (since `n - 1` for the minimum value of `n` which is 2, gives `right` a value of 1). Therefore, `left` being 0 and `right` being at least 1 ensures that the condition `left <= right` is true, and the loop will execute at least once.

No adjustments are needed.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
