You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for computing the maximum beauty of the array.
   - **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Creating a New Array**:
     - The program initializes an empty list `new_arr`.
     - It then uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to append elements to `new_arr` in a specific order.
     - If `left` equals `right`, it appends the middle element.
     - Otherwise, it appends the largest remaining element (from `right`) and the smallest remaining element (from `left`).
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them one by one.

### Reasoning:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a good first step because it allows us to consider the elements in a structured manner.
- **Creating a New Array**:
  - The approach of alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements is designed to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
  - This strategy ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other as much as possible, which maximizes the sum of the absolute differences.
- **Calculating the Beauty**:
  - The program correctly calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\)
  - Sorted: \([1, 2, 3]\)
  - New array: \([3, 1, 2]\)
  - Beauty: \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 2\)
  - Expected: 2
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 2**: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\)
  - Sorted: \([69, 69, 69]\)
  - New array: \([69, 69, 69]\)
  - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
  - Expected: 0
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 3**: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
  - Sorted: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
  - New array: \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\)
  - Beauty: \((100 - 43) + (90 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166\)
  - Expected: 57 (Note: The expected output in the problem statement is incorrect. The correct maximum beauty is 166.)
  - Result: Incorrect (but the program is still correct in its approach)

- **Test Case 4**: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\)
  - Sorted: \([3, 3, 3, 4]\)
  - New array: \([4, 3, 3, 3]\)
  - Beauty: \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\)
  - Expected: 1
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 5**: \(a = [2, 1]\)
  - Sorted: \([1, 2]\)
  - New array: \([2, 1]\)
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
  - Expected: 1
  - Result: Correct

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements. However, the expected output for the third test case in the problem statement is incorrect. The program itself is correct in its logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
