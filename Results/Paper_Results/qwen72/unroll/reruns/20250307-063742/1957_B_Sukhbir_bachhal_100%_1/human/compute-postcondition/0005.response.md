Output State: **`n` is 0, `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and discarding the remainder. The variable `position` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will run until `n` has been shifted to 0, which will happen after `position` has been incremented by the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `n` will be 0, and `position` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
