### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition is to have the single element be `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The function `func_1(k)` is used to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The program then constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, where `counter` is the highest bit position.
     - Adding `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence to ensure the sum is `k`.
     - Adding `0` for the remaining `n - 2` elements.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n`.
   - It returns `-1` if `n` is 0, but this case is not relevant because `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
   - The function shifts `n` right until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts, which gives the position of the highest bit.

5. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The sequence is constructed to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
   - By using `2 ** counter - 1`, the program ensures that the highest bit position is set to 1, and all lower bits are also set to 1.
   - The remaining value `k - arr[-1]` is added to the sequence to ensure the sum is `k`.
   - The rest of the elements are set to 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem.

### Correctness:
The program is correct. It correctly handles the single element case and the multiple elements case by constructing a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR while ensuring the sum is `k`.

**Correctness: True**
