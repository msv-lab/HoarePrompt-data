### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs a sequence where the first element is `2^counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2^counter - 1)`. The remaining elements are all 0.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `n` and returns it minus one.
   - This is done by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that the first element is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The second element is the remainder of `k` after subtracting the first element.
   - The remaining elements are 0, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.

5. **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
   - By setting the first element to `2^counter - 1`, we ensure that all bits up to the highest bit position of `k` are set to 1.
   - The second element is the remainder, which may or may not contribute additional 1s to the bitwise OR.
   - The remaining elements being 0 do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `k`.
   - When `n` is greater than 1, the program ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence to satisfy the given conditions and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

**Correctness: True**
