### Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Sequence**:
   - The program constructs the sequence as \([2^{\text{counter}} - 1, k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1), 0, 0, \ldots, 0]\) when \(n > 1\).
   - The sum of this sequence is \((2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) + 0 + 0 + \ldots + 0 = k\).
   - When \(n = 1\), the sequence is simply \([k]\), and the sum is \(k\).
   - This ensures that the sum condition is always satisfied.

2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR**:
   - The function `func_1(k)` returns the highest bit position set in \(k\).
   - The value \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) is a number with all bits set up to the highest bit position of \(k\).
   - The second element \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\) will have some bits set, but it will not affect the bits already set by \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) in the OR operation.
   - The OR of the sequence will be \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) OR \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\), which is \(k\).
   - Since \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) has the maximum number of 1s possible up to the highest bit position of \(k\), the OR operation will maximize the number of 1s.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(n = 1\) by simply printing \(k\).
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns the highest bit position set in \(k\), which is used to construct the sequence.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position set in \(k\).
   - It shifts \(k\) right until \(k\) becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in \(k\).
   - This is correct because the number of shifts required to reduce \(k\) to 0 is equal to the number of bits in \(k\), and subtracting 1 gives the highest bit position.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions: the sum of the sequence is \(k\) and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Final: **True**
