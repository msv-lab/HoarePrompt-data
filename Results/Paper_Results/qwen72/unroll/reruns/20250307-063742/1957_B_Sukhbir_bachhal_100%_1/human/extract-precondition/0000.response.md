It seems there's a mismatch in the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description involves two parameters, `n` and `k`, but the function definition only includes one parameter, `n`. For the purpose of this task, I will assume the correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
```

Given this, the precondition for the function based on the problem description would be:

Precondition: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
