You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and returns the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sum of Sequence**: The sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) must sum to \(k\).
2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\).

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - If \(n > 1\):
     - It calls a function `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in \(k\).
     - It appends \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) to the sequence. This value is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit position of \(k\).
     - It appends \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\) to the sequence to ensure the sum is \(k\).
     - It appends \(n - 2\) zeros to the sequence to ensure the sequence has \(n\) elements.
   - If \(n = 1\):
     - It simply prints \(k\).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function determines the highest bit position set in \(k\).
   - It initializes `position` to 0.
   - It shifts \(k\) right until \(k\) becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in \(k\).

### Correctness Check:
1. **Sum of Sequence**:
   - If \(n > 1\), the sequence is constructed as \([2^{\text{counter}} - 1, k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1), 0, 0, \ldots, 0]\).
   - The sum of this sequence is \((2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) + 0 + 0 + \ldots + 0 = k\).
   - If \(n = 1\), the sequence is simply \([k]\), and the sum is \(k\).

2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR**:
   - If \(n > 1\), the first element \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) has all bits set up to the highest bit position of \(k\).
   - The second element \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\) will have some bits set, but it will not affect the bits already set by \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) in the OR operation.
   - The OR of the sequence will be \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) OR \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\), which is \(k\).
   - Since \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) has the maximum number of 1s possible up to the highest bit position of \(k\), the OR operation will maximize the number of 1s.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(n = 1\) by simply printing \(k\).
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns the highest bit position set in \(k\), which is used to construct the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions: the sum of the sequence is \(k\) and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
