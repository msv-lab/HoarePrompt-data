Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation does not always produce the correct sequence.

### Issues:
1. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`. This is used to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - The program then constructs the sequence by adding `2**counter - 1` (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position) and `k - (2**counter - 1)` to the sequence.
   - This approach does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Handling of Remaining Elements**:
   - The program appends `0` to the sequence for the remaining `n-2` elements. This is not optimal because it does not consider other possible values that could contribute to the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, the sequence should be constructed such that each bit position is set to 1 in at least one of the numbers. This can be achieved by distributing the sum `k` in a way that each bit position is used efficiently.

### Example:
For the input `2 5`, the current program outputs `5 0`, which is correct. However, for the input `6 51`, the program outputs `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

A correct sequence for `6 51` would be `1 1 1 1 1 46`, where:
- `1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 46 = 47` (binary representation: `101111`), which has 5 ones.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, you can distribute the sum `k` in a way that each bit position is set to 1 in at least one of the numbers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        # Distribute the sum k to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if k > 0:
                arr.append(1 << i)  # Set the i-th bit to 1
                k -= 1 << i
            else:
                arr.append(0)
        arr.append(k)  # The last element takes the remaining sum
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)
```

This approach ensures that each bit position is used efficiently, maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
