### Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Sequence**:
   - The program constructs the sequence such that the sum of its elements equals \(k\).
   - For \(n > 1\), the sequence is \([2^{\text{counter}} - 1, k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1), 0, 0, \ldots, 0]\).
   - The sum of this sequence is:
     \[
     (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) + 0 + 0 + \ldots + 0 = k
     \]
   - For \(n = 1\), the sequence is \([k]\), and the sum is \(k\).

2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR**:
   - The function `func_1(k)` correctly determines the highest bit position set in \(k\).
   - The value \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit position of \(k\).
   - The second element \(k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)\) will have some bits set, but it will not affect the bits already set by \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) in the OR operation.
   - The OR of the sequence will be:
     \[
     (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \text{ OR } (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) \text{ OR } 0 \text{ OR } 0 \text{ OR } \ldots \text{ OR } 0 = k
     \]
   - Since \(2^{\text{counter}} - 1\) has the maximum number of 1s possible up to the highest bit position of \(k\), the OR operation will maximize the number of 1s.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(n = 1\) by simply printing \(k\).
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns the highest bit position set in \(k\), which is used to construct the sequence.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - \(n\) and \(k\) are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly returns the highest bit position set in \(k\).
  - The state after the function call is that `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial \(k\), and the function returns `position - 1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions: the sum of the sequence is \(k\) and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Final: **True**
