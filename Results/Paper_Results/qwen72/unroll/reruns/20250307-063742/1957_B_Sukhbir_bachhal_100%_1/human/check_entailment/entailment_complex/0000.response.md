### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position in `k` and constructs the sequence accordingly.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It returns the position of the highest bit minus one. For example, if `k` is 8 (binary `1000`), it returns 3 (since the highest bit is at position 4, and 4-1 = 3).

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, where `counter` is the highest bit position in `k`.
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence.
     - It appends `n-2` zeros to the sequence.
   - This approach ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program ensures that the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s by using the highest bit position.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest bit position in `k`.
   - The sequence construction logic is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
