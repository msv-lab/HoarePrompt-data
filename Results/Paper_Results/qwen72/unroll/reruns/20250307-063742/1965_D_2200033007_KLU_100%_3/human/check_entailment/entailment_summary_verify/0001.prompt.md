You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes the trailing matching elements from both lists, ensuring that the remaining elements in each list retain their original order. The function returns the last element of the modified `bigList` after the trailing matching elements have been removed. If no trailing elements match or if `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an error (IndexError) because it attempts to return the last element of `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the sums of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindromic array `a`.
   - We need to recover any possible palindromic array `a` that matches the given subarray sums.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function computes the sums of all subarrays of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and each ending index `j` (where `j` starts from `i` and goes to the end of the array).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j` and appends it to the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts` and returns it.
   - This function is correct and serves to generate the subarray sums for testing purposes.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the missing subarray sum.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to keep track of the sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a sum appears twice, it is removed from the list `odds`.
   - The remaining elements in `odds` are the sums that appear an odd number of times, and one of these will be the missing subarray sum.
   - This function is correct and effectively identifies the missing subarray sum.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the list of odd sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the list `odds` and places the values in the middle of the array, ensuring the array remains palindromic.
   - If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array, it directly assigns the value.
   - Otherwise, it assigns half of the difference between the current sum and the previous sum to the positions `idx` and `n - 1 - idx`.
   - This function is correct and ensures that the array `a` is palindromic and matches the given subarray sums.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program.
   - It appears to be a helper function that might be used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists.
   - However, it is not necessary for the solution as the missing sum is already identified in `func_2`.
   - This function is not required for the correctness of the solution, but it does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and reconstructs a valid palindromic array `a` that matches the given subarray sums.

Correctness: **True**
