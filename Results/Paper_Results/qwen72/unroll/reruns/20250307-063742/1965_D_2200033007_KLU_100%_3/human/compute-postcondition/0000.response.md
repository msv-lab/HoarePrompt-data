To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition checks if `smallList` is not empty. If `smallList` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `smallList` must have at least one element.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition checks if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. If this condition is not met, the loop will not execute. Therefore, the last elements of both lists must be equal.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`.

To satisfy the conditions for the loop to execute:
- `smallList` must have at least one element.
- The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it is already implied that `smallList` can be empty or have elements that are also in `bigList` in the same order. However, for the loop to execute, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` must match the last element of `smallList`.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`**
