### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to recover a palindromic array `a` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function computes the sums of all subarrays of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and each ending index `j` (where `j` starts from `i` and goes to the end of the array).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j` and appends it to the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts` and returns it.
   - **Accuracy:** The function is correct and serves to generate the subarray sums for testing purposes. The annotations correctly describe the state and behavior of the function.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the missing subarray sum.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to keep track of the sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a sum appears twice, it is removed from the list `odds`.
   - The remaining elements in `odds` are the sums that appear an odd number of times, and one of these will be the missing subarray sum.
   - **Accuracy:** The function is correct and effectively identifies the missing subarray sum. The annotations correctly describe the state and behavior of the function.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the list of odd sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the list `odds` and places the values in the middle of the array, ensuring the array remains palindromic.
   - If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array, it directly assigns the value.
   - Otherwise, it assigns half of the difference between the current sum and the previous sum to the positions `idx` and `n - 1 - idx`.
   - **Accuracy:** The function is correct and ensures that the array `a` is palindromic and matches the given subarray sums. The annotations correctly describe the state and behavior of the function.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program.
   - It appears to be a helper function that might be used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists.
   - However, it is not necessary for the solution as the missing sum is already identified in `func_2`.
   - **Accuracy:** The function is not required for the correctness of the solution, but it does not affect the overall correctness of the program. The annotations correctly describe the state and behavior of the function.

### Main Logic:
- The main logic of the program:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the subarray sums.
  - It sorts the subarray sums and uses `func_2` to identify the missing subarray sum.
  - Depending on the length of the `odds` list, it either:
    - Directly appends the missing sum to `odds` and reconstructs the array using `func_3`.
    - Adjusts the size of the array and reconstructs it using `func_3`, then finds the missing sum using `func_4`.
  - Finally, it prints the reconstructed palindromic array.

### Evaluation:
- The main logic correctly handles the identification of the missing subarray sum and the reconstruction of the palindromic array.
- The use of `func_2` to identify the missing sum is accurate and effective.
- The use of `func_3` to reconstruct the array ensures that the array is palindromic and matches the given subarray sums.
- The function `func_4` is not necessary for the solution but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Assessment:
The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and reconstructs a valid palindromic array `a` that matches the given subarray sums.

Final: **True**
