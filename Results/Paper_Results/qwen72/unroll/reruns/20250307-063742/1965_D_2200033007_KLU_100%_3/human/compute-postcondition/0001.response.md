Output State: **bigList and smallList will have their trailing matching elements removed, but the remaining elements in each list will retain their original order.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. In each iteration, the last elements of both lists are removed (popped). Therefore, after the loop completes, the lists will no longer have matching elements at their ends, and the remaining elements will be in the same order as they were initially.
