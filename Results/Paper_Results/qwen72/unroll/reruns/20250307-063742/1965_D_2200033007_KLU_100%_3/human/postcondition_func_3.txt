The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes the trailing matching elements from both lists, ensuring that the remaining elements in each list retain their original order. The function returns the last element of the modified `bigList` after the trailing matching elements have been removed. If no trailing elements match or if `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an error (IndexError) because it attempts to return the last element of `bigList`.
