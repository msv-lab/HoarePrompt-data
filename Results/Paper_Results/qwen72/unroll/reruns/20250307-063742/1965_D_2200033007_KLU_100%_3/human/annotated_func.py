#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing the cumulative sums of all subarrays of `a` starting from each index to the end of the list. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers representing subarray sums and returns a new list `odds` containing the unique subarray sums from `cts` that do not have an identical duplicate immediately preceding them in the list. The original list `cts` remains unchanged.

    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the operations performed inside the loop. Specifically, for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `a` will have been populated with the calculated values, and `prev` will be the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be -1.

    #The program returns a list `a` where each element is the result of the operations performed inside the loop. If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current value of `x` from the `odds` list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the `odds` list. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `a` will have been populated with the calculated values, and `prev` will be the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an odd integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are populated based on the values in `odds`. For each value `x` in `odds`, if the current index `idx` is the middle index of `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from `odds`. After the function completes, `a` is a list of integers that reflects these operations, and the final state of the program is that `a` is fully populated, `prev` is the last element of `odds`, and `idx` is -1.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the modified `bigList`, which is the last element in the list after the trailing matching elements between `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes the trailing matching elements from both lists, ensuring that the remaining elements in each list retain their original order. The function returns the last element of the modified `bigList` after the trailing matching elements have been removed. If no trailing elements match or if `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an error (IndexError) because it attempts to return the last element of `bigList`.
