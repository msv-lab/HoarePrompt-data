### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the sums of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindromic array `a`.
   - We need to recover the palindromic array `a` from the given subarray sums.
   - The input is guaranteed to have at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function computes all subarray sums of a given array `a` and returns them sorted. It is used to generate the subarray sums of a candidate array `b`.
   - **func_2:** This function identifies the unique subarray sums that do not have an identical duplicate immediately preceding them in the list. It is used to filter out the subarray sums that are unique and potentially represent the missing sum.
   - **func_3:** This function constructs a palindromic array `a` from a list of unique subarray sums `odds` and an integer `n`. It populates the array such that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is set to the unique sum, and the other elements are set to half the difference of consecutive unique sums.
   - **func_4:** This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted subarray sums of the candidate array `b` with the given subarray sums. It removes the trailing matching elements and returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the subarray sums `subarraySums`.
   - It sorts the `subarraySums` and uses `func_2` to identify the unique subarray sums.
   - Depending on the number of unique subarray sums, it either:
     - Constructs a candidate array `b` with `n + 2` elements if there are more unique subarray sums than `(n + 1) // 2`.
     - Constructs a candidate array `b` with `n - 2` elements if there are fewer or equal unique subarray sums.
   - It then uses `func_1` to generate the subarray sums of the candidate array `b`.
   - The missing subarray sum is determined using `func_4`.
   - The missing sum is added to the list of unique subarray sums and the process is repeated to construct the final palindromic array `a`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique subarray sums using `func_2`.
   - It correctly constructs the candidate array `b` and generates its subarray sums using `func_1`.
   - The missing subarray sum is correctly identified using `func_4`.
   - The final palindromic array `a` is constructed using `func_3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the number of unique subarray sums is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` by constructing a candidate array `b` with `n + 2` elements.
   - It also handles the case where the number of unique subarray sums is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` by constructing a candidate array `b` with `n - 2` elements.
   - The program ensures that the final array `a` is palindromic by setting the elements symmetrically.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the functions work together to recover a valid palindromic array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
