You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a palindrome array, n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the operations performed inside the loop. Specifically, for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `a` will have been populated with the calculated values, and `prev` will be the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be -1.
    return a
    #The program returns a list `a` where each element is the result of the operations performed inside the loop. If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current value of `x` from the `odds` list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the `odds` list. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `a` will have been populated with the calculated values, and `prev` will be the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` where the middle element is set to the last element of `odds`, and for all other elements, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current element in `odds` and `prev` is the previous element in `odds`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `a` where each element is the result of the operations performed inside the loop. If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current value of `x` from the `odds` list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the `odds` list. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `a` will have been populated with the calculated values, and `prev` will be the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
