The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList` and `smallList`. Both `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, and `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`. After executing the function body, the function returns the last element of the modified `bigList`, which is the list after the trailing matching elements between `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It returns the last element of `bigList` after removing the trailing matching elements found in both lists.**
