### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a hidden palindrome array `a` of size `n` from a list of subarray sums, where one subarray sum is missing.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n + 1 - i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

2. **Function Breakdown:**
   - **`func_1(a)`:**
     - This function computes the cumulative sums of all subarrays of `a` and returns a sorted list of these sums.
     - It correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them, which is necessary for further processing.

   - **`func_2(cts)`:**
     - This function identifies the unique subarray sums from the list `cts` that do not have a duplicate immediately preceding them.
     - It is used to filter out the sums that are likely to be the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of the palindrome array.
     - The function correctly returns the list `odds` containing these unique sums.

   - **`func_3(odds, n)`:**
     - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list `odds` and the size `n`.
     - It correctly populates the array `a` by setting the middle element to the current value of `x` if `idx` is the middle index, or by setting both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2` otherwise.
     - The function ensures that the array `a` is a palindrome and returns it.

   - **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`:**
     - This function removes the trailing matching elements from `bigList` and `smallList` and returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
     - It is used to identify the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.
     - The function correctly returns the last element of `bigList` after removing the trailing matching elements.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the list of subarray sums `subarraySums`.
   - It sorts the subarray sums and uses `func_2` to identify the unique subarray sums.
   - Depending on the length of the unique subarray sums, it either:
     - Identifies the missing sum directly if the number of unique sums is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.
     - Uses `func_3` to generate a candidate array `b` and `func_1` to compute the subarray sums of `b`.
     - Uses `func_4` to find the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.
   - Finally, it reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using `func_3` and prints it.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints specified in the problem, such as the size of `n` and the number of test cases.
   - It correctly identifies and handles the missing subarray sum, ensuring that the reconstructed array `a` is a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall structure of the program ensures that the palindrome array `a` is correctly reconstructed.

**Correctness: **True****
