Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a correct solution for the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how the functions work together to solve the problem:

1. **func_1(a)**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. It is used to verify the correctness of the solution by generating the subarray sums of the recovered array.

2. **func_2(cts)**: This function identifies the missing subarray sum from the list of subarray sums `cts`. It does this by maintaining a list of "odds" which keeps track of sums that appear an odd number of times. Since the array is a palindrome, the subarray sums should appear an even number of times, except for the missing one. The function returns the list of sums that appear an odd number of times, which should ideally be a list of one or two elements (depending on the structure of the palindrome).

3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`). It places the elements in the array such that the array remains a palindrome. The function iterates from the middle of the array outward, placing the appropriate values to ensure the array is a palindrome and the sums match the given conditions.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function is not directly used in the solution but seems to be a utility function to find the first element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList` when both lists are compared from the end. This function is not necessary for the main logic of the problem but could be used to verify the missing sum if needed.

The overall approach is to:
- Identify the missing subarray sum using `func_2`.
- Use the identified sums to reconstruct the palindrome array using `func_3`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the output is a valid palindrome array that matches the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is correct.
