The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a palindrome array, and `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The function returns a list `a` where each element is calculated based on the values in `odds`. If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current value of `x` from the `odds` list. For all other indices, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the `odds` list. The `prev` variable is updated to the current value of `x` after each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1 until the loop finishes.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` where the middle element is set to the last element of `odds`, and for all other elements, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current element in `odds` and `prev` is the previous element in `odds`.**
