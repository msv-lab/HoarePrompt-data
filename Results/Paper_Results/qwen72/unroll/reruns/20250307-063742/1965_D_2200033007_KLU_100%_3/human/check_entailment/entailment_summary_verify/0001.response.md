### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a palindromic array `a` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function computes the sums of all subarrays of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and each ending index `j` (where `j` starts from `i` and goes to the end of the array).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j` and appends it to the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts` and returns it.
   - This function is correct and serves to generate the subarray sums for testing purposes.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the missing subarray sum.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to keep track of the sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a sum appears twice, it is removed from the list `odds`.
   - The remaining elements in `odds` are the sums that appear an odd number of times, and one of these will be the missing subarray sum.
   - This function is correct and effectively identifies the missing subarray sum.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the list of odd sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the list `odds` and places the values in the middle of the array, ensuring the array remains palindromic.
   - If the index `idx` is the middle index of the array, it directly assigns the value.
   - Otherwise, it assigns half of the difference between the current sum and the previous sum to the positions `idx` and `n - 1 - idx`.
   - This function is correct and ensures that the array `a` is palindromic and matches the given subarray sums.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program.
   - It appears to be a helper function that might be used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists.
   - However, it is not necessary for the solution as the missing sum is already identified in `func_2`.
   - This function is not required for the correctness of the solution, but it does not affect the overall correctness of the program.
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_4`, but since it is not used, it does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and reconstructs a valid palindromic array `a` that matches the given subarray sums. The unused function `func_4` does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Final: **True**
