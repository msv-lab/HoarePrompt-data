The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an odd integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are populated based on the values in `odds`. For each value `x` in `odds`, if the current index `idx` is the middle index of `a`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from `odds`. After the function completes, `a` is a list of integers that reflects these operations, and the final state of the program is that `a` is fully populated, `prev` is the last element of `odds`, and `idx` is -1.
