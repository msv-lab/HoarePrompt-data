The function `func_2` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x` (1 <= x <= n). It returns a tuple containing two values: the total number of "good components" found in the subtrees of vertex `v`, plus 1 if the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v` is less than `x`; and the sum of the sizes of the subtrees of vertex `v` that have a size less than `x`, plus 1. The "good components" are counted based on the condition that if a subtree has a size of `x` or more, it is considered a good component.
