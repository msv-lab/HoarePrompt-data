### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The key points are:
     - The tree is a connected acyclic graph.
     - Removing \( k \) edges should result in at least \( k + 1 \) components.
     - Each component must have at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **TreeNode and Tree Classes:**
     - These classes define the structure of the tree and its vertices. Each vertex has attributes like `edges`, `children`, `subtree_size`, `parent`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.
     - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree and calculates the `subtree_size` for each vertex.

   - **func_1:**
     - This function performs a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree.
     - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex.
     - `good_components` is incremented by the sum of `good_components` of its children and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to \( x \).
     - `remaining_size` is incremented by the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than \( x \).

   - **func_2:**
     - This function performs a recursive post-order traversal of the tree.
     - It returns the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex \( v \).
     - The logic is similar to `func_1`, but it uses recursion instead of a stack.

   - **func_3:**
     - This function checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
     - It uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the number of good components is exactly \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).

   - **func_4:**
     - This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that `func_3` returns `True`.
     - It starts with `beg = 1` and `end = n` and narrows down the range until `beg` equals `end`.

   - **func_5:**
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to print the result.

3. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly handle star graphs.
   - Let's consider the example given:
     ```
     1
     4 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```
     - The tree is a star graph with vertex 1 as the center.
     - Removing any edge will result in a component of size 1 and another component of size 3.
     - The maximum \( x \) should be 1.

4. **Testing the Program:**
   - **Star Graph Example:**
     - Construct the tree:
       ```python
       tree = Tree(4)
       tree.add_edge(0, 1)
       tree.add_edge(0, 2)
       tree.add_edge(0, 3)
       tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
       ```
     - Call `func_4`:
       ```python
       print(func_4(tree, 4, 1))  # Expected output: 1
       ```
     - **func_1** and **func_2** will correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes:
       - For vertex 1, 2, and 3, `good_components` will be 0 and `remaining_size` will be 1.
       - For vertex 0, `good_components` will be 3 (since removing any edge will create 3 components of size 1) and `remaining_size` will be 1.
     - **func_3** will check if it is possible to remove 1 edge such that each component has at least \( x \) vertices:
       - For \( x = 1 \), `good_components` is 3, which is greater than 1, so `func_3` returns `True`.
       - For \( x = 2 \), `good_components` is 0, and `remaining_size` is 1, so `func_3` returns `False`.
     - **func_4** will perform binary search and find that the maximum \( x \) is 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the star graph example and other cases.
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle star graphs properly.
