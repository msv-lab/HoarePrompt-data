You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n-1` pairs of integers. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and adds `n-1` edges to the tree based on the input pairs. The tree is then rooted, and the function calls `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as arguments, printing the result of `func_4`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result of `func_4`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to remove exactly `k` edges.
   - The goal is to find the maximum number `x` such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of several functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads the input and constructs the tree.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_2` and `func_1` are used to traverse the tree and count the number of good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_5`:**
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n` and `k`, constructs the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.
     - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and edges are added between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` to handle 0-based indexing.
     - The tree is rooted using `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`.
     - This function seems to correctly handle the input and output as described.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - Performs a binary search on the possible values of `x` from 1 to `n`.
     - Uses `func_3` to check if the current midpoint `mid` is a valid `x`.
     - Adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_3`.
     - Returns the maximum valid `x`.
     - The binary search logic is correct and efficient.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - Calls `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the root.
     - Checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with the remaining size being at least `x`.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to check if a given `x` is valid.

   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are used to traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size.
     - `func_1` uses a stack to perform a non-recursive post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a similar traversal.
     - Both functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic for counting good components and remaining sizes is consistent and correct.

4. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` with vertices and edges.
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and the traversal functions correctly handle the tree structure.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 by implicitly not removing any edges.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is close to `n-1` (i.e., removing almost all edges), ensuring that the remaining components are valid.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in components of at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The traversal functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly compute the necessary values for the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
