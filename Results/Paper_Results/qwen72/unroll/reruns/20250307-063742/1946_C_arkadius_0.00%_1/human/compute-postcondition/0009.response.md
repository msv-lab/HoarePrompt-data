Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, an integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` if the number of good components in the tree (as determined by `func_1`) is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size of the tree is at least `x`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. **
