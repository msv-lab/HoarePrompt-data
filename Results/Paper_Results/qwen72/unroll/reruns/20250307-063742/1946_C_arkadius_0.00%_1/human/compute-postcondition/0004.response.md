Output State: **The loop iterates `n-1` times, reading pairs of integers from the input and adding edges to the `tree` instance. After the loop, `n` and `k` retain their initial values, and the `tree` instance has `n-1` edges added to it. The `tree` instance has been rooted at node 0 with a parent value of -1.**
