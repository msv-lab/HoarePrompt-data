### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are used to represent the tree. The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to root the tree at vertex 0. This method correctly sets the parent and children relationships and calculates the `subtree_size` for each vertex. This ensures that the tree is properly rooted and the necessary attributes are set for further processing.

2. **Component Calculation:**
   - `func_1` is a non-recursive function that traverses the tree in a post-order manner. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex. The logic for updating these attributes is correct:
     - `good_components` is incremented by the sum of `good_components` of its children and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - `remaining_size` is incremented by the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that does the same as `func_1`. Both functions are logically equivalent and correct in their implementation.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`. It uses the results from `func_1` (or `func_2`) to determine this. The conditions for returning `True` or `False` are correct:
     - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it returns `True`.
     - If the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it returns `True`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`. The binary search logic is correct:
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It iterates, setting `mid` to the midpoint of `beg` and `end`.
     - If `func_3` returns `True` for `mid`, it sets `beg` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `end` to `mid - 1`.
     - The loop continues until `beg` equals `end`, at which point it returns `beg`.

4. **Input Handling and Output:**
   - `func_5` reads the input data, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`. It then prints the result.
   - The input handling is correct, and the function processes each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and meets the problem description. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall logic for finding the maximum `x` is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
