The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x`. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex in the tree. The `good_components` attribute of a vertex is incremented by the sum of `good_components` of its children and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of a vertex is incremented by the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. After the function concludes, it returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex `s`, reflecting the updated state of the subtree rooted at `s`.
