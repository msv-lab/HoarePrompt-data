Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Tree Class Missing**: The provided program assumes the existence of a `Tree` class, but the definition of this class is not included. Without the `Tree` class, the program cannot be executed as it stands. The `Tree` class should include methods for adding edges, rooting the tree, and managing the vertices and their properties.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Good Components**: In `func_1` and `func_2`, the logic for counting good components and remaining sizes is not consistent. Both functions are supposed to perform similar tasks, but they are implemented differently. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search in `func_4` is implemented correctly, but it relies on `func_3`, which in turn relies on `func_1`. If `func_1` or `func_3` are incorrect, the binary search will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Input Handling**: The function `func_5` is responsible for reading input and constructing the tree. However, it does not handle the multiple test cases correctly. The program should read the number of test cases `t` and then loop over each test case, but `func_5` does not do this.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the tree is a star (a single vertex connected to all others), the logic for counting good components and remaining sizes might not work as expected.

### Suggested Improvements:

1. **Define the `Tree` Class**: Ensure that the `Tree` class is defined with the necessary methods and properties.
2. **Consistent Logic**: Ensure that the logic for counting good components and remaining sizes is consistent across `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. **Multiple Test Cases**: Modify `func_5` to handle multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and looping over them.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Add checks and handling for edge cases, such as star trees or very small trees.

Here is a revised version of the program with these improvements:

```python
import sys

class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.children = []
        self.good_components = 0
        self.remaining_size = 1

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.vertices = [Vertex(i) for i in range(n)]
        self.n = n
        self.root = 0

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.vertices[u].children.append(v)
        self.vertices[v].children.append(u)

    def root_tree_non_recursive(self, root, parent):
        stack = [(root, parent)]
        while stack:
            (v, p) = stack.pop()
            for u in self.vertices[v].children:
                if u != p:
                    stack.append((u, v))
                    self.vertices[u].children.remove(v)
        self.root = root

# Function 1:
def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        (v, postorder) = stack.pop()
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
    return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

# Function 2:
def func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        (good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree) = func_2(tree, u, x)
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
    return (good_components, remaining_size)

# Function 3:
def func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:
    (good_components, remaining_size) = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if good_components > k:
        return True
    if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:
        return True
    return False

# Function 4:
def func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return beg

# Function 5:
def func_5():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        tree = Tree(n)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            u, v = map(int, input().split())
            tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
        print(func_4(tree, n, k))

func_5()
```

This revised version includes the `Tree` class and handles multiple test cases correctly. It also ensures that the logic for counting good components and remaining sizes is consistent.
