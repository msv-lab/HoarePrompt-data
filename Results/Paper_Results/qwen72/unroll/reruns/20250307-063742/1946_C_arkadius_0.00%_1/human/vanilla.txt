- The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in components of at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The traversal functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly compute the necessary values for the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
