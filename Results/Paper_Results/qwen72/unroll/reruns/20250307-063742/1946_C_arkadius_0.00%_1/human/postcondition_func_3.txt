The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices and a positive integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n. It returns the largest integer value `x` for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` returns `True`. After the function concludes, the input `tree` and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` is also unaffected. The final state of the program includes the return value `x` which is the largest integer satisfying the condition.
