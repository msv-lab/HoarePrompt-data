The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, and `x` is a positive integer. The function returns `True` in two cases and `False` in one case. Since the specific conditions for each case are not provided, we can generalize the functionality based on the given output cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, an integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` in two possible scenarios and `False` in one scenario, based on some conditions related to the tree structure and the values of `k` and `x`.**
