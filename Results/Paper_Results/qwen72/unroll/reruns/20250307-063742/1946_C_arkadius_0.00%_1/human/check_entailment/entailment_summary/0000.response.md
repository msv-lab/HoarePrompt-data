### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are used to construct and manage the tree. The `add_edge` method adds edges between nodes, and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree non-recursively, setting up the parent and children relationships and calculating the subtree sizes. This ensures that the tree is properly constructed and rooted.

2. **Good Components Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function uses a non-recursive post-order traversal to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each node. It correctly propagates the information from the children to the parent, ensuring that the subtree sizes and good components are calculated correctly.

3. **Recursive Good Components Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function is a recursive version of the good components calculation. It returns the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at the given vertex. This function is not used in the main flow but is provided for reference. It is consistent with the logic of `func_1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum x:**
   - The `func_3` function checks if a given `x` can be a valid solution by using the results from `func_1`. It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`. This is a standard approach for finding the maximum value that satisfies a condition, and it is implemented correctly.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x` for each test case. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the tree, roots it, and uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into components of at least size `x` after removing exactly `k` edges. The functions `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` work together to achieve this, and the main function `func_5` handles the input and output as required.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program meets the problem description and handles the input and output correctly. The logic for finding the maximum `x` is sound and the implementation is consistent with the problem requirements.
