Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is a star graph (a tree where one vertex is connected to all other vertices, and there are no other edges). In such a case, removing any edge will result in a component of size 1 and another component of size \( n-1 \). The program should be able to handle this case and determine the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices. However, the current implementation of `func_3` and `func_4` does not correctly account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
The tree is a star graph with vertex 1 as the center. Removing any edge will result in a component of size 1 and another component of size 3. The maximum \( x \) should be 1, but the program might incorrectly return a different value.
