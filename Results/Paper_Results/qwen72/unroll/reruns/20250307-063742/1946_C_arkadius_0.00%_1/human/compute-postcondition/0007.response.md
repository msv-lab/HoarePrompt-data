Functionality: ** The function `func_5` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n-1` pairs of integers. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and adds `n-1` edges to the tree based on the input pairs. The tree is then rooted, and the function calls `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as arguments, printing the result of `func_4`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result of `func_4`. **
