To determine what will be printed when the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement executes, we need to analyze the initial state and the function `func_4` in detail.

### Initial State:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates `n-1` times, reading pairs of integers from the input and adding edges to the `tree` instance.
2. **Variables**:
   - `n`: The number of nodes in the tree.
   - `k`: A parameter that retains its initial value.
3. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `tree` instance is a tree data structure with `n-1` edges added to it.
   - The tree is rooted at node 0 with a parent value of -1.

### Function `func_4`:
Since the function `func_4` is not provided in the code snippet, we need to make some assumptions based on common tree-related operations. Typically, such a function might perform operations like calculating the height of the tree, the number of nodes at a certain depth, or some other property of the tree.

### Analysis:
1. **Tree Construction**:
   - The tree is constructed by adding `n-1` edges, which means it is a connected graph with `n` nodes.
   - The tree is rooted at node 0, and each node has a parent value, with node 0 having a parent value of -1 (indicating it is the root).

2. **Function Call**:
   - `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called with the `tree` instance, the number of nodes `n`, and the parameter `k`.

### Possible Function Behavior:
Without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only speculate based on common tree operations. Here are a few possibilities:
- **Height Calculation**: `func_4` might calculate the height of the tree.
- **Node Count at Depth `k`**: `func_4` might count the number of nodes at depth `k` from the root.
- **Subtree Size**: `func_4` might return the size of the subtree rooted at a specific node.

### Output Determination:
Given the lack of specific details about `func_4`, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **[result of func_4(tree, n, k)] (where the result depends on the specific implementation of `func_4`, which could be the height of the tree, the number of nodes at depth `k`, or some other property of the tree)**

This output describes the potential result of the `func_4` function call, acknowledging that the exact value cannot be determined without the function's implementation.
