### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program is structured with five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to traverse the tree and count the number of good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_5`:**
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n` and `k`, constructs the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.
     - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and edges are added between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` to handle 0-based indexing.
     - The tree is rooted using `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`.
     - This function correctly handles the input and output as described.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - Performs a binary search on the possible values of `x` from 1 to `n`.
     - Uses `func_3` to check if the current midpoint `mid` is a valid `x`.
     - Adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_3`.
     - Returns the maximum valid `x`.
     - The binary search logic is correct and efficient.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - Calls `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the root.
     - Checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with the remaining size being at least `x`.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to check if a given `x` is valid.

   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are used to traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size.
     - `func_1` uses a stack to perform a non-recursive post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a similar traversal.
     - Both functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic for counting good components and remaining sizes is consistent and correct.

4. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` with vertices and edges.
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and the traversal functions correctly handle the tree structure.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 by implicitly not removing any edges.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is close to `n-1` (i.e., removing almost all edges), ensuring that the remaining components are valid.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in components of at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The traversal functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly compute the necessary values for the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic and handles the problem as described.

Final: **True**
