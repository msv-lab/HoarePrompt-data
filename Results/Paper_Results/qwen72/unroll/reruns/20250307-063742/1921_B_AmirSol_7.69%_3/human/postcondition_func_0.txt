The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference. The final state of the program is that `i` is equal to `n`, and `counter` contains the computed number of differences.
