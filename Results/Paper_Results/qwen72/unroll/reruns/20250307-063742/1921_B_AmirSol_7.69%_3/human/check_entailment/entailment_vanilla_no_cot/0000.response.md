Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to solve the problem correctly based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` to compare the states of the boxes. If the states are different, it checks if the next box also needs to be changed and if the current and next boxes have different states in `s1`. If so, it performs a move operation (which can change two boxes in one day) and increments the counter by 1, skipping the next box. If not, it performs a single operation (either placing or removing a cat) and increments the counter by 1. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to achieve the desired configuration of cats in the boxes.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading multiple test cases and processing each one individually. The output format matches the requirements, printing the minimum number of operations for each test case on a separate line.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the logic implemented in the program seems to be efficient and correct.
