You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat.

    #State: `i` is `n`, `counter` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference. The final state of the program is that `i` is equal to `n`, and `counter` contains the computed number of differences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an initial state `s1` and a desired state `s2` of `n` boxes, where each box can either contain a cat ('1') or not ('0').
   - The goal is to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2` using the minimum number of operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Placing a cat in an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The solution provided uses a while loop to iterate through the boxes and count the number of operations required.
   - The loop checks if the current box in `s1` is different from the corresponding box in `s2`.
   - If the current box is different, it checks if the next box is also different and if the current and next boxes have different states in `s1`.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs a single operation to move the cat and skips the next box.
   - If the conditions are not met, it performs a single operation to either place or remove a cat and moves to the next box.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies when a cat can be moved from one box to another in a single operation.
   - The logic also correctly identifies when a cat needs to be placed or removed.
   - The solution ensures that the minimum number of operations is counted by considering the possibility of moving a cat in pairs of different boxes.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles cases where the initial and desired states are the same (no operations needed).
   - It also handles cases where the initial and desired states are completely different, requiring the maximum number of operations.
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the initial and desired states have a mix of matching and non-matching boxes.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution iterates through the boxes in a single pass, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
   - The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables for counting and indexing.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case (`10010` to `00001`), the solution correctly identifies that two operations are needed: move the cat from the first box to the fifth box, and remove the cat from the fourth box.
   - For the second test case (`1` to `1`), the solution correctly identifies that no operations are needed.
   - For the third test case (`000` to `111`), the solution correctly identifies that three operations are needed: place a cat in each of the three boxes.
   - For the fourth test case (`0101` to `1010`), the solution correctly identifies that two operations are needed: move the cat from the second box to the first box, and move the cat from the fourth box to the third box.
   - For the fifth test case (`100` to `101`), the solution correctly identifies that one operation is needed: place a cat in the third box.
   - For the sixth test case (`10011001` to `11111110`), the solution correctly identifies that four operations are needed: move the cat from the first box to the second box, move the cat from the fourth box to the third box, move the cat from the sixth box to the fifth box, and move the cat from the eighth box to the seventh box.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.
