Output State: **`i` is `n`, `counter` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` character by character.
- If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different (`s1[i] != s2[i]`), the loop checks if the next character (`s1[i + 1]`) is also different and if the current and next characters in `s1` are not the same.
- If both conditions are met, it increments the `counter` by 1 and skips the next position by incrementing `i` by 2.
- If the conditions are not met, it increments the `counter` by 1 and moves to the next position by incrementing `i` by 1.
- If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` are the same, it simply moves to the next position by incrementing `i` by 1.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, meaning all characters have been checked.
- Therefore, after the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `counter` will count the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference.
