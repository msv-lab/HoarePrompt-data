The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat. The function returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with consecutive differing positions that are not the same in `s1` counted as a single difference.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, treating consecutive differing positions as a single difference.**
