Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the main issue with the program: the sorting method used does not guarantee that the points will be in the correct order to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points, but these pairs might not be adjacent corners of the square, leading to incorrect side length calculations.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment is indeed the right approach. It sorts the coordinates first by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate, ensuring that the points are in the order: bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, top-right. This allows for the correct extraction of the side length by calculating the difference in x-coordinates between the bottom-left and bottom-right points (or y-coordinates between bottom-left and top-left points). Squaring this side length gives the correct area of the square.

Given the problem constraints and the need to ensure the points are in the correct order, the original program's approach to calculating the area is flawed. The corrected program addresses this issue and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
