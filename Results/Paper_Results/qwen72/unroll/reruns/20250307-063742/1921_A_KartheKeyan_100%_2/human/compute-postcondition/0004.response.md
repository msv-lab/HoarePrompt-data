The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, it is designed to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function receives two integers, `x_i` and `y_i`, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function is expected to return the area of the square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. It returns the area of the square for each test case.**
