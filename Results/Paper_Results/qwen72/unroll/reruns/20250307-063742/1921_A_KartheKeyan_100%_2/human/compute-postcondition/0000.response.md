Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t testcases, x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer input provided by the user.
- The `while` loop runs as long as `n` is non-zero.
- Inside the loop, `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is another integer input provided by the user.
- The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and then updated to `s += (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`.
- The value of `s` is printed.
- `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- After the loop completes, `n` is 0, and the loop exits.
- The initial state variables `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
