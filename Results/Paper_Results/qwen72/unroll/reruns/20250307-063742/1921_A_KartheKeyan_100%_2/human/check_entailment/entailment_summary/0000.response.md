Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to calculate the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, which can disrupt the order of the points. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the coordinates should be processed in a way that allows us to identify the side lengths directly. Sorting the coordinates can lead to incorrect pairings of points.

2. **Calculating the Side Length**: The program calculates the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula, but it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the product of the square roots of two distances, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The area of a square is simply the side length squared.

4. **Rounding the Result**: The program rounds the result, which is unnecessary since the area of a square with integer coordinates will always be an integer.

A correct approach would be to:
- Identify the side length by finding the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points.
- Calculate the area as the side length squared.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
