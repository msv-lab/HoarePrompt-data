Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The function sorts the coordinates, which is a good approach to ensure that the points are in a predictable order. However, the sorting alone does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order for a square with sides parallel to the axes. The correct order should be such that the first two points are on one side of the square, and the last two points are on the opposite side.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the squared distances between the first two points (`p1`) and the last two points (`p2`). For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between the first two points and the last two points should be the same, and this distance should be the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: The function calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then rounding the result. However, since `p1` and `p2` are both squared distances of the side length, taking the square root of each and then multiplying them is unnecessary. The area of the square is simply the square of the side length, which can be obtained by taking the square root of either `p1` or `p2` and then squaring it, or directly using `p1` or `p2`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the input will always form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. However, the current implementation might not handle cases where the points are not in the correct order after sorting, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. The side length should be the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points after sorting. The current implementation calculates the Euclidean distance, which is not appropriate for this problem.

Given these points, the function is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the area of the square.

Correctness: **False**
