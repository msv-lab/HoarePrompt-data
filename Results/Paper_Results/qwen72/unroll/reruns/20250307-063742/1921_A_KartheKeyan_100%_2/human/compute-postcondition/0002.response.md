The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is an integer, it can be any non-zero value, either positive or negative.

State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t testcases, x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` must be non-zero.**
