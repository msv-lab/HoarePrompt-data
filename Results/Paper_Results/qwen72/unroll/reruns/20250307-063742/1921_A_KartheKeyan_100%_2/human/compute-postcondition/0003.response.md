Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 each time until `n` reaches 0. For each iteration, the loop reads four pairs of coordinates, sorts them, calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates, and prints the area rounded to the nearest integer. The value of `n` is now 0, and the values of `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
- These coordinates are sorted, and the side lengths of the square are calculated using the distance formula between the appropriate points.
- The area of the square is then calculated by multiplying the side lengths and taking the square root of each, and the result is printed rounded to the nearest integer.
- After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.
- Once `n` reaches 0, the loop terminates.
- The initial value of `t` and the coordinates `x_i` and `y_i` are not modified by the loop, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
