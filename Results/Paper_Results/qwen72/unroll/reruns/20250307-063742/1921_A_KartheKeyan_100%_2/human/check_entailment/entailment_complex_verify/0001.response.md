Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the main issue with the program: the method used to calculate the side length of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that the sorted coordinates will always place the points in a specific order that allows the calculation of the side length by taking the distance between `coord[1]` and `coord[0]`, and `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`. However, this is not guaranteed by the default tuple sorting method, which sorts by the x-coordinate first and then by the y-coordinate.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the coordinates by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate.
2. Extract the side length by calculating the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points.
3. Calculate the area by squaring the side length.

The original program does not follow this correct approach, leading to potential incorrect results. The corrected program provided in the original assessment is indeed the correct way to solve the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program as incorrect.

Final: **False**
