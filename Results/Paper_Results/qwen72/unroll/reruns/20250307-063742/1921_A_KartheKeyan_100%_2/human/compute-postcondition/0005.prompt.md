You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t testcases, x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

        n -= 1
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 each time until `n` reaches 0. For each iteration, the loop reads four pairs of coordinates, sorts them, calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates, and prints the area rounded to the nearest integer. The value of `n` is now 0, and the values of `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. It returns the area of the square for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
