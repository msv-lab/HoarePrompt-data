Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in every potential case. Specifically, the method used to calculate the area is flawed. The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent points (p1 and p2) and then takes the square root of each and multiplies them together. This approach assumes that the points are already sorted in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. The correct approach would be to find the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two points that are either horizontally or vertically aligned and then squaring this distance to get the area.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The program will output `9`, which is incorrect. The correct area of the square is `9` (side length `3`), but the program's logic for calculating the area is flawed and does not handle the input correctly.
