The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates the area of the square and prints the area rounded to the nearest integer. After processing all test cases, the value of `n` is 0, and the values of `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged.
