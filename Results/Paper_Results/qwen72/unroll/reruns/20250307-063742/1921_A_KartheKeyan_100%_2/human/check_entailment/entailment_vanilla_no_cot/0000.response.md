Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the distances between certain pairs of points and then computing the area. However, the approach is flawed:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, which can lead to incorrect results because the corners of the square are not necessarily in a specific order. Sorting the coordinates will not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form a square.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points (p1 and p2) and then takes the square root of each to get the side length. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the points are not correctly identified as adjacent corners of the square.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of a square is simply the side length squared. The program incorrectly multiplies the square roots of two distances and then rounds the result, which can produce incorrect areas.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
1. Identify the side length of the square by finding the distance between two adjacent corners.
2. Compute the area as the side length squared.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted([point[0] for point in coord])
        y_coords = sorted([point[1] for point in coord])
        
        # The side length of the square is the difference between the two middle x or y coordinates
        side_length = x_coords[2] - x_coords[0]  # or y_coords[2] - y_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Extracting Coordinates**: The program extracts all x and y coordinates separately and sorts them.
- **Side Length Calculation**: The side length of the square is the difference between the two middle x or y coordinates. This works because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as the side length squared, which is the correct formula for the area of a square.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
