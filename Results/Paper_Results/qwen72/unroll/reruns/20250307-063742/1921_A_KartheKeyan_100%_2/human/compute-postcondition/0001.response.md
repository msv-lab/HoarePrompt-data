Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t testcases, x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The initial state for `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remains unchanged.
