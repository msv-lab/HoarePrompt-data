Output State: **The `answers` list contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and each pair is in the format `rank1suit1 rank2suit2`. The `trumps` list is empty if all trumps have been used, otherwise, it contains the remaining ranks of the trump suit. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit. The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, and the trump suit `trump` remains the same as the initial state.**
