You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` where each card is a two-character string with the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards in the list are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, the trump suit `trump` is the value provided by the `input()`, the list of 2n cards `cards` remains unchanged, `trumps` contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `answers` list contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and each pair is in the format `rank1suit1 rank2suit2`. The `trumps` list is empty if all trumps have been used, otherwise, it contains the remaining ranks of the trump suit. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit. The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, and the trump suit `trump` remains the same as the initial state.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty, and the loop has printed pairs of the remaining trump ranks in descending order, each followed by the trump suit. The `answers` list, `suits` dictionary, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty, the loop has printed all the elements in the `answers` list, and the `suits` dictionary, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 16), `trump` (a string representing the trump suit, one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique cards, each represented as a two-character string with the first character being the rank and the second character being the suit). The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the exact output is not specified.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
