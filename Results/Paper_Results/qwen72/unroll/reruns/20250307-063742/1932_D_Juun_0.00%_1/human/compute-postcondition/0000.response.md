Output State: **The function should take three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` where each card is a two-character string with the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards in the list are unique. The `input()` function has been called, but no specific value has been assigned to any variable.**
