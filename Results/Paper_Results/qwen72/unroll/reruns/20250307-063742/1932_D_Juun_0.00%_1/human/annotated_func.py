#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` where each card is a two-character string with the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards in the list are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, the trump suit `trump` is the value provided by the `input()`, the list of 2n cards `cards` remains unchanged, `trumps` contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `answers` list contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and each pair is in the format `rank1suit1 rank2suit2`. The `trumps` list is empty if all trumps have been used, otherwise, it contains the remaining ranks of the trump suit. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit. The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, and the trump suit `trump` remains the same as the initial state.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty, and the loop has printed pairs of the remaining trump ranks in descending order, each followed by the trump suit. The `answers` list, `suits` dictionary, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty, the loop has printed all the elements in the `answers` list, and the `suits` dictionary, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump`, and a list of 2n unique cards. It processes the cards to find pairs of cards for each suit, excluding the trump suit, and pairs any remaining cards with the trump suit. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints the pairs of cards, with non-trump pairs first in sorted order, followed by any remaining trump pairs in descending order. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The original input parameters `n`, `trump`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
