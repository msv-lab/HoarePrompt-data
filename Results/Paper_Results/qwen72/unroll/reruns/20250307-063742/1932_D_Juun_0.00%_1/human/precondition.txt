The function `solve` is expected to handle the input and output as described in the problem. It should read from standard input a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played, the second line contains a single character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and the third line contains a list of 2n unique card descriptions, each a two-character string where the first character is the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit (one of "CDHS"). The function should output the possible sequence of rounds for each test case, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence exists.
