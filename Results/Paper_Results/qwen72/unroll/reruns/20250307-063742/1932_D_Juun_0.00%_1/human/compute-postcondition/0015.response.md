The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of rounds, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump` is a string representing the trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is a two-character string. The first character represents the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character represents the suit (one of "C", "D", "H", or "S").

The function returns a result based on these parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 16), `trump` (a string representing the trump suit, one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique cards, each represented as a two-character string with the first character being the rank and the second character being the suit). The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the exact output is not specified.**
