Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `answers` list contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and each pair is in the format `rank1suit1 rank2suit2`. The `trumps` list is now sorted in ascending order if it contains any ranks, otherwise, it remains empty. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit. The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, and the trump suit `trump` remains the same as the initial state.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
