Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged, the trump suit `trump` is the value provided by the `input()`, the list of 2n cards `cards` remains unchanged, `trumps` contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` contains the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that has been matched and is not the trump suit, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each with a value of `None` if a pair has been matched for that suit, or the rank of the last unmatched card for that suit.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
