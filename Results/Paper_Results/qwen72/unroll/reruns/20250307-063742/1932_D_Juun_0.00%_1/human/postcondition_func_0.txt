The function reads input values for the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump`, and a list of 2n unique cards. It processes the cards to find pairs of cards for each suit, excluding the trump suit, and pairs any remaining cards with the trump suit. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints the pairs of cards, with non-trump pairs first in sorted order, followed by any remaining trump pairs in descending order. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The original input parameters `n`, `trump`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
