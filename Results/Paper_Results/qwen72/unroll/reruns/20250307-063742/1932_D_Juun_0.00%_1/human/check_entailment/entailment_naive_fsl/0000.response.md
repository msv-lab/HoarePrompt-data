Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple cards of the same suit but no trump cards to beat them. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
2
D
3D 4D 5D 6D
```

The program will incorrectly output:

```
3D 4D
5D 6D
```

However, this is not a valid solution because the second player cannot beat the first player's card in the first round (3D) with a card of the same suit (4D) since 4D is not of a higher rank. The correct output for this case should be "IMPOSSIBLE".
