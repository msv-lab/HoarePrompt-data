### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump`, and the list of 2n cards `cards`.

2. **Card Processing:**
   - The program initializes a list `trumps` to store the ranks of trump cards.
   - It also initializes a list `answers` to store the pairs of cards that can be matched.
   - A dictionary `suits` is used to keep track of the last unmatched card for each suit.

3. **Matching Cards:**
   - For each card in the input, the program:
     - Checks if the card is a trump card and adds its rank to the `trumps` list.
     - If the card is not a trump card and there is already a card of the same suit in `suits`, it sorts the ranks and appends the pair to `answers`, then sets the suit to `None`.
     - If the card is not a trump card and there is no card of the same suit in `suits`, it stores the rank in `suits`.

4. **Handling Remaining Unmatched Cards:**
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining unmatched cards in `suits`.
   - If there are, it tries to match them with the remaining trump cards.
   - If there are no trump cards left to match, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

5. **Printing Remaining Trump Pairs:**
   - The program sorts the remaining trump ranks and prints pairs of trump cards in descending order.

6. **Printing All Answers:**
   - Finally, the program prints all the pairs stored in `answers`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It prints the required output format for each test case.

- **Card Matching:**
  - The program correctly identifies and processes trump cards and non-trump cards.
  - It ensures that non-trump cards are matched with cards of the same suit and higher rank.
  - It correctly matches remaining non-trump cards with trump cards when necessary.

- **Handling IMPOSSIBLE Cases:**
  - The program correctly identifies and handles cases where it is impossible to match all cards, printing "IMPOSSIBLE" and returning.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no trump cards left to match remaining non-trump cards.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including all edge cases and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
