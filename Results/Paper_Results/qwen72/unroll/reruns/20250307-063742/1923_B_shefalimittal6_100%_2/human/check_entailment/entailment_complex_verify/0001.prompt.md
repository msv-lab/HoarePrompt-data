You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, x is a list of distinct integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and k is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of a and x are equal, and no element in x is zero.

    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0

        distance += 1
        
    #State: `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is the number of seconds it took to eliminate all monsters, and all elements in `a` are 0.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: a list `a` of positive integers representing the health of each monster, a list `x` of distinct integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The function processes the monsters in the order of their proximity to the origin (0), attempting to reduce their health to 0 by firing `k` bullets each second. If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance from the origin, the function returns `False`. If all monsters are eliminated, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, all elements in `a` are 0, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4.

    #State: t remains an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4, and the loop has executed t times, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the result of func_1(a, x, k).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 30,000`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x`. For each iteration, it prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise. After `t` iterations, the function completes, leaving `t` unchanged and having printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` and `k`: Number of monsters and the number of bullets you can fire per second.
     - `a`: List of health points of the monsters.
     - `x`: List of initial positions of the monsters.

2. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Every second, you can fire up to `k` bullets at any monsters.
   - Each bullet reduces the health of a targeted monster by 1.
   - After you fire, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
   - All alive monsters move 1 point closer to you.
   - If any monster reaches position 0, you lose.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if you can kill all monsters before any of them reaches position 0, otherwise print "NO".

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, x, k)`
1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`: Number of monsters.
   - `sorted_indices`: Indices of monsters sorted by their distance from the character (absolute value of `x`).
   - `distance`: Current distance from the character.
   - `pos`: Current position in the sorted list of indices.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues until all monsters are processed (`pos != len(sorted_indices)`).
   - **Inner Loop:**
     - If the current monster's distance is equal to the current `distance`, return `False` because the monster has reached the character.
     - Otherwise, fire bullets at the current monster until it is either killed or you run out of bullets for the current second.
     - Decrease the health of the current monster and update the remaining bullets.
     - If the current monster is killed, move to the next monster in the sorted list.
   - Increment the `distance` to simulate the passage of one second.

3. **Return:**
   - If all monsters are processed without any reaching the character, return `True`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Read Number of Test Cases:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.

2. **Process Each Test Case:**
   - Read `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - Read the health points `a` and positions `x` of the monsters.
   - Call `func_1(a, x, k)` and print "YES" if it returns `True`, otherwise print "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sorting by Distance:**
   - The program correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from the character using `sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))`. This ensures that you always target the closest monsters first, which is a crucial strategy to avoid losing.

2. **Bullet Firing Logic:**
   - The program correctly simulates the firing of up to `k` bullets per second.
   - It ensures that if a monster is within the current `distance`, it returns `False` immediately, indicating that the character loses.

3. **Monster Movement:**
   - The program implicitly handles the movement of monsters by incrementing the `distance` variable. This simulates the passage of time and the movement of monsters closer to the character.

4. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is large enough to kill all monsters in one second.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 1 and there are multiple monsters, ensuring that the character does not lose if the strategy is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It sorts the monsters by their distance, simulates the firing of bullets, and checks if any monster reaches the character. The test case handling is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
