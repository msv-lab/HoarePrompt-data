The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop runs.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the state already specifies that `1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4`, this condition is already met, and no further adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4, `_` is a placeholder that will take on values from 0 to t-1**
