Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - **Input**: Lists `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), and `k` (number of bullets you can fire each second).
   - **Process**:
     - It first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character (0 point) using `sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))`.
     - It then iterates through the sorted indices, targeting the closest monsters first.
     - For each second, it tries to kill as many monsters as possible with the available bullets (`k`).
     - If a monster reaches the character (i.e., its distance is equal to the current `distance`), the function returns `False` (you lose).
     - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the character, the function returns `True` (you survive).

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - **Input**: Number of test cases `t`.
   - **Process**:
     - It reads the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, the health of the monsters, and their positions.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints "YES" if you can survive, otherwise "NO".

The logic in `func_1` ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is a necessary strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the character. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, making it a valid solution for the problem.
