### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - `func_2` correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, reading the necessary inputs for each test case and printing the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

2. **Monster Elimination Logic:**
   - `func_1` processes the monsters in the order of their proximity to the origin (0) by sorting the indices of `x` based on the absolute value of their positions. This ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is a crucial part of the strategy to survive.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted indices, attempting to reduce the health of each monster by firing up to `k` bullets each second. If a monster's health is reduced to 0, it is considered dead, and the function moves to the next monster.
   - The function also checks if any monster reaches the origin (0) by comparing the absolute value of the monster's position with the current distance from the origin. If a monster reaches the origin, the function returns `False` immediately, indicating that the character is killed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the number of bullets `k` is greater than or equal to the health of the closest monster. In such cases, the function will eliminate the monster in the current second.
   - The function also handles the case where the number of bullets `k` is less than the health of the closest monster, ensuring that the character can still survive if the monsters are far enough away.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm in `func_1` is designed to prioritize the elimination of the closest monsters first, which is the optimal strategy to ensure survival. This is because the closer a monster is, the fewer seconds it has before it reaches the origin.
   - The function correctly updates the distance and the health of the monsters, and it correctly checks if any monster has reached the origin.

5. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The combination of `func_2` and `func_1` meets the problem description. `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, and `func_1` processes the test case to determine if the character can survive and kill all the monsters.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
