Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: a list `a` of positive integers representing the health of each monster, a list `x` of distinct integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The function processes the monsters in the order of their proximity to the origin (0), attempting to reduce their health to 0 by firing `k` bullets each second. If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance from the origin, the function returns `False`. If all monsters are eliminated, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, all elements in `a` are 0, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described. **
