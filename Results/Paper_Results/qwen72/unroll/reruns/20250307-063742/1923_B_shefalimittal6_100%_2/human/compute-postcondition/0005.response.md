Output State: **`pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is the number of seconds it took to eliminate all monsters, and all elements in `a` are 0.**

Explanation: The loop continues until all monsters are eliminated, which means `pos` will eventually be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`. During each iteration, the `distance` variable increments by 1, representing the number of seconds that have passed. The loop reduces the health of the monsters (`a`) by firing `k` bullets each second, and when a monster's health reaches 0, `pos` is incremented. By the end of the loop, all elements in `a` will be 0, indicating that all monsters have been eliminated.
