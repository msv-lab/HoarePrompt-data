The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it seems that there might be an implicit or external use of a variable `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value, but we can infer that the function likely returns a value or performs an action based on the value of `t`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates based on an integer `t` within the range 1 to 30,000. The specific return value or action is not provided, so the functionality cannot be fully described.**
