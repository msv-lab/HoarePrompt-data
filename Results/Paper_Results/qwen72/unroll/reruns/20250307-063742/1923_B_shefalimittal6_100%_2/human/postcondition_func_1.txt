The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 30,000`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x`. For each iteration, it prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise. After `t` iterations, the function completes, leaving `t` unchanged and having printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
