The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of distinct integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and no element in `x` is zero. The function always returns `True`.
