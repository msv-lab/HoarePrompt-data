### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`.
     - `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster.
     - `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster.
     - `k` is an integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second.
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the origin (0).
     - It then iterates through the sorted indices, attempting to reduce the health of each monster by firing up to `k` bullets each second.
     - If a monster's position matches the current distance from the origin, the function returns `False` (indicating that the character is killed).
     - The function continues to fire bullets until either all monsters are eliminated or a monster reaches the character.
   - **Output**:
     - The function returns `True` if all monsters are eliminated before any of them reach the character.
     - The function returns `False` if any monster reaches the character.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Behavior**:
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
     - It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - **Output**:
     - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `t` and iterating `t` times.
- **Monster Elimination**: `func_1` correctly processes the monsters in the order of their proximity to the origin, ensuring that the closest monsters are targeted first.
- **Bullet Firing**: `func_1` correctly fires up to `k` bullets each second, reducing the health of the monsters accordingly.
- **Game Logic**: The function checks if any monster reaches the character by comparing the current distance from the origin to the monster's position. If a monster's position matches the current distance, the function returns `False`.
- **Correctness**: The logic in `func_1` ensures that the character can survive and kill all monsters if the conditions allow it. The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Both functions work together to handle multiple test cases and determine if the character can survive and kill all monsters.

### Correctness: **True**
