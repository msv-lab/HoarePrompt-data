Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `v` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is a type variable.**

The code snippet `T = TypeVar('T')` introduces a type variable `T`, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the type variable `T`.
