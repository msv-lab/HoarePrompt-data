Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function is responsible for solving the problem for a single test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) (i.e., `x * x <= n`).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`, which reads `n` and `m` for that test case.

2. **Iterating Over Pairs:**
   - `func_1` iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is a valid approach because if \(x\) is greater than \(\sqrt{n}\), then \((x + y) \cdot x\) will exceed `n` for any positive `y`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both `a` and `b` are within their respective bounds.

3. **GCD Check:**
   - The program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) using `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. This is correct because we only need to consider pairs where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\). This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for integer \(k\).

5. **Output:**
   - `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case. It handles the input and output correctly, and the algorithm for counting valid pairs is sound.

Correctness: **True**
