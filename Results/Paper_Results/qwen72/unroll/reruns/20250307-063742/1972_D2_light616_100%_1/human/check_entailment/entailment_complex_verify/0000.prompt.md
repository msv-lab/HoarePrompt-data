You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime and satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of all valid pairs (x, y) that are coprime and satisfy the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates the number of pairs (x, y) where x and y are coprime, and both (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m are satisfied. The function prints this count and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed count of valid (x, y) pairs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` remains the same as the input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the integer `t` remains unchanged, and the function itself does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the input should consist of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` reads the input directly without considering the number of test cases. This means that `func_1` will only process the first test case and will not handle the subsequent test cases correctly.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case, but the problem description specifies that the program should handle multiple test cases. The function `func_2` attempts to call `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` does not reset its state or reinitialize variables for each test case, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

To correct this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process each test case independently, ensuring that the state is reset for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    x = 1
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func_2()
```

This version of the program correctly handles multiple test cases and resets the state for each test case, ensuring that the output is correct for all test cases.
