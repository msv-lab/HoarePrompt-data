### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`, which reads `n` and `m` for that test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Iterating Over Pairs:**
   - `func_1` iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is a valid approach because if \(x\) is greater than \(\sqrt{n}\), then \((x + y) \cdot x\) will exceed `n` for any positive `y`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both `a` and `b` are within their respective bounds.

3. **GCD Check:**
   - The program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) using `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. This is correct because we only need to consider pairs where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\). This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for integer \(k\).

5. **Output:**
   - `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program's time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{n} \cdot m)\) in the worst case, which is efficient enough given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
  - The use of \(\sqrt{n}\) as the upper limit for `x` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the program more efficient.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the smallest possible values (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)) correctly, as seen in the example where the output is 0 for \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\).
  - The program also handles larger values as seen in the example for \(n = 1000000\) and \(m = 1145141\), where it correctly outputs 5933961.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case, handles the input and output correctly, and the algorithm for counting valid pairs is sound.

Final: **True**
