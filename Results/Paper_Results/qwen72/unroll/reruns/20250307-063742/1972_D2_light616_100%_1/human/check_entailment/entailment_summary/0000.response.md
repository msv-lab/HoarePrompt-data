Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to solve the problem for a single test case. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`
     - `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`
   - The function uses a nested loop where `x` and `y` are incremented to find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the pair to be valid.
   - The function then counts the number of valid pairs and prints the count.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time solving the problem for a new pair of `n` and `m`.

3. **Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`
     - `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`
   - The program should handle multiple test cases and print the result for each test case.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the pairs `(a, b)` are valid by checking the conditions and counting the pairs that satisfy them.
   - The program as a whole correctly solves the problem for multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
