### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, `func_1` is called, and it reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Iterating Over Pairs:**
   - `func_1` iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is a valid approach because for any `x` greater than \(\sqrt{n}\), \((x + y) \cdot x\) would exceed `n` for any positive `y`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both `a` and `b` are within their respective bounds.

3. **GCD Check:**
   - The program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) using `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. This is correct because we only need to consider pairs where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\). This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for integer \(k\).

5. **Output:**
   - `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

- **State After `func_1` Execution:**
  - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
  - `cnt` is the sum of all valid pairs \((x, y)\) where `x` and `y` are coprime and satisfy the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Range of Iteration:**
  - The original assessment correctly states that the program iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that all valid pairs are considered.

- **GCD Condition:**
  - The GCD condition is correctly checked and used to filter valid pairs.

- **Counting Valid Pairs:**
  - The counting mechanism is correct. The program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by considering the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

- **Output:**
  - The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case, handles the input and output correctly, and the algorithm for counting valid pairs is sound.

Final: **True**
