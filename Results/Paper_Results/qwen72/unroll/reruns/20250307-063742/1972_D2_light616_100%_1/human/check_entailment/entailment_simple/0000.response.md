### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It iterates over `x` while \(x \cdot x \le n\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for finding pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime and satisfy the given conditions.
   - The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - The condition \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the bounds.
   - The increment of `cnt` by the minimum of the two quotients correctly counts the valid pairs.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The state of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution, which is as expected.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly by printing 0.
   - The program also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) correctly, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

**Correctness: True**
