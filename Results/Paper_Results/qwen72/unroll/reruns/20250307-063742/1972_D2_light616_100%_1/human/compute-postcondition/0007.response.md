Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates the number of pairs (x, y) where x and y are coprime, and both (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m are satisfied. The function prints this count and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed count of valid (x, y) pairs. **
