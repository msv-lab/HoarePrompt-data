Precondition: **None** 

(Note: The function `func_2` does not have any parameters in its signature, and it relies on user input to define the variable `t`. The function `func_1` is called within a loop that runs `t` times, but since `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine any preconditions related to its parameters or behavior.)
