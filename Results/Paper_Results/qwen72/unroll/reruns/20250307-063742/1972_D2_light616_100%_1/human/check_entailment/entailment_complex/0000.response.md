Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This function correctly handles the input and the iteration over multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - It checks if `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., `gcd(x, y) == 1`).
   - If they are coprime, it adds the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs `cnt`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies pairs `(a, b)` where `a = (x + y) * x` and `b = (x + y) * y` and checks if `gcd(a, b) = x + y` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is satisfied if `gcd(x, y) == 1` because `gcd((x + y) * x, (x + y) * y) = (x + y) * gcd(x, y) = (x + y) * 1 = x + y`.
   - The algorithm ensures that all pairs `(a, b)` are considered by iterating over `x` and `y` appropriately.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, correctly outputting 0 as no pairs satisfy the conditions.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as demonstrated in the example.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm is efficient enough to handle the constraints `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6` and `1 <= t <= 10^4` by limiting the iterations to the square root of `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
