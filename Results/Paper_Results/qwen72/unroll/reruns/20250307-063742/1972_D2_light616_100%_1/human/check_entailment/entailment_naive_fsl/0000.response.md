Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the input should consist of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` reads the input directly without considering the number of test cases. This means that `func_1` will only process the first test case and will not handle the subsequent test cases correctly.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case, but the problem description specifies that the program should handle multiple test cases. The function `func_2` attempts to call `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` does not reset its state or reinitialize variables for each test case, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

To correct this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process each test case independently, ensuring that the state is reset for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    x = 1
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func_2()
```

This version of the program correctly handles multiple test cases and resets the state for each test case, ensuring that the output is correct for all test cases.
