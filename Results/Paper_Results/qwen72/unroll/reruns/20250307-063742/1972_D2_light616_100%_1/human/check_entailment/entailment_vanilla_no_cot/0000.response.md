Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1, ensuring that both `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` do not exceed `n` and `m` respectively.
   - It checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1.
   - If the gcd condition is satisfied, it adds the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to the counter `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the counter `cnt`.

3. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is equivalent to checking if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The program correctly identifies pairs `(a, b)` where `gcd(a, b) = 1` and then counts the valid pairs by dividing `n` and `m` by the appropriate multiples.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a nested loop, but the outer loop runs only up to the square root of `n`, and the inner loop runs up to the point where `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` exceed `n` and `m` respectively.
   - This ensures that the program remains efficient even for large values of `n` and `m`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should handle the test cases as expected.
