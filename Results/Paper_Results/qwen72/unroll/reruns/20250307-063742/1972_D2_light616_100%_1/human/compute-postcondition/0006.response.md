The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function may use or return values related to positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely returns a value or values that are within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, or it may perform some operation involving these integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It likely returns a value or values related to positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, or performs an operation involving these integers.**
