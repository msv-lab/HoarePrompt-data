To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - `cnt` is the sum of all valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime and satisfy the conditions:
     - `(x + y) * x <= n`
     - `(x + y) * y <= m`

2. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `x`: This variable is determined by the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. For example, if `n = 10`, then `x = 4` because the square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, and the smallest integer greater than 3.16 is 4.
   - `cnt`: This variable is the sum of all valid pairs `(x, y)` that meet the specified conditions. The pairs `(x, y)` must be coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1) and must satisfy both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - `(x + y) * x <= n`: This condition ensures that the product of `x` and the sum of `x` and `y` does not exceed `n`.
   - `(x + y) * y <= m`: This condition ensures that the product of `y` and the sum of `x` and `y` does not exceed `m`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The value of `cnt` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`. Without knowing the exact values of `n` and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`.
   - However, we can describe `cnt` as the sum of all valid pairs `(x, y)` that meet the conditions described above.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print(cnt)` statement will output the sum of all valid pairs `(x, y)` that are coprime and satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of all valid pairs (x, y) that are coprime and satisfy the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)**
