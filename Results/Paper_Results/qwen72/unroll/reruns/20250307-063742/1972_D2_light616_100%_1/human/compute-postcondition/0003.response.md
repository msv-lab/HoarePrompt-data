The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameter constraints and no specific output provided, it is not possible to determine the exact return value from the information given. However, generally, a function without parameters and without a specified return value might return `None` or perform some operation that does not require input and does not return a value explicitly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and may return `None` or perform an operation without returning a value.**
