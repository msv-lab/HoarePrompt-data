You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, queries):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `queries` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) for which the function needs to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop, `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where len(subseq_lens) is the length of the list `subseq_lens`)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `mx`, `t`, and `queries` remain unchanged. `x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop. `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to the end, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `queries`. It returns a list of arrays, where each array corresponds to a value in `queries` and contains integers that form an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
