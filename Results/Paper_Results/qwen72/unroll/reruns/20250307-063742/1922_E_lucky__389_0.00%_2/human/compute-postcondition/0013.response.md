The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `queries`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `queries` is a list of integers, where each integer represents a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) for which the function needs to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

The function returns a list of arrays, where each array corresponds to one of the values in `queries` and contains integers that form an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `queries`. It returns a list of arrays, where each array corresponds to a value in `queries` and contains integers that form an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.**
