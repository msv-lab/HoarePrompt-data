Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, queries):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `queries` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) for which the function needs to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. `x` is an input integer and is now `x - 1`.**
