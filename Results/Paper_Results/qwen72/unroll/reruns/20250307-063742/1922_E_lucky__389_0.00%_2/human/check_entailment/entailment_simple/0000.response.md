### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but the function itself is not defined to take any parameters. This is incorrect because the function should handle the input for each test case.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(t, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `queries` is a list of integers representing the values of `X` for each test case.

2. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The function subtracts 1 from `x` and then tries to decompose `x` into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - The loop correctly finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and appends the corresponding `i` value to `subseq_lens`.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 0, which is correct.

3. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first creating a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end of `ansv`.
   - This construction is incorrect because it does not ensure that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array should be constructed in a way that it matches the number of increasing subsequences required.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.
   - The length of `ansv` is printed as `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which is incorrect because it should be the length of the constructed array.
   - The elements of `ansv` are printed, but the array construction is flawed, leading to incorrect output.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because:
- The function definition does not match the problem description.
- The array construction logic does not ensure that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The output length is incorrect and does not match the constructed array.
