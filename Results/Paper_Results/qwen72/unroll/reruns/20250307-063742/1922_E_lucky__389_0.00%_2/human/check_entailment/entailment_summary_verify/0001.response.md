### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If no such array exists, print -1.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( X \) and subtracts 1 from it. This is because the problem considers an empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, so \( X - 1 \) accounts for the non-empty subsequences.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.
   - It enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - For each term \( 2^i - 1 \) that can be subtracted from \( X \), it appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and updates `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appending the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Input and Output Format**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. It also prints the length of the array and the array elements in the correct format.
   - **Decomposition of \( X \)**: The approach of decomposing \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 is mathematically sound. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) is given by \( 2^n - 1 \) (excluding the empty subsequence). By subtracting 1 from \( X \), the program effectively accounts for the empty subsequence.
   - **Array Construction**: The construction of the array `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \). The first part of the array `ansv` is constructed by adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, which ensures that the array has a strictly increasing subsequence of length `mx`. The second part of the array `ansv` is constructed by appending the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element, which ensures that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - **Array Length and Element Range**: The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 and the elements are within the specified range. Given the constraints and the nature of the decomposition, the array length should not exceed 200, and the elements are integers within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \)**: The problem guarantees that \( X \) is at least 2, so the program does not need to handle \( X = 1 \).
   - **No Valid Array**: The problem guarantees that \( X \) is at least 2, and the decomposition approach should always find a valid array. Therefore, the program does not need to handle the case where no valid array can be constructed.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently. The decomposition approach is efficient and should work within the constraints.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The decomposition and construction logic are sound, and the program adheres to the input and output formats.
