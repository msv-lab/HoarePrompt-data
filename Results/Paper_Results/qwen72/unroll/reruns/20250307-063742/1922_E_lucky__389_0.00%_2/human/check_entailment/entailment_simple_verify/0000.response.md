### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but it does not take any parameters. This is a deviation from the typical structure where the function would take the number of test cases and the queries as parameters. However, this does not necessarily make the program incorrect, as it can still read inputs directly from `input()`.

2. **Algorithm for Finding the Array:**
   - The program initializes `x` to the input value minus 1. This is because the number of increasing subsequences of an array of length `n` is \(2^n - 1\), and the program aims to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The program then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and appends the corresponding exponent to `subseq_lens`. It subtracts \(2^i - 1\) from `x` and updates `mx` to the maximum exponent found.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 0, which means all required increasing subsequences have been accounted for.

3. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding all integers from 0 to `mx - 1` (inclusive). This ensures that the array has a base of increasing elements.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end of `ansv`. This step is intended to add the necessary elements to achieve the exact number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

5. **Testing with `X = 3`:**
   - For `X = 3`, the program should output an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences.
   - The program initializes `x` to 2 (`3 - 1`).
   - The first iteration of the loop finds `i = 1` because \(2^2 - 1 = 3\) is greater than `x + 1 = 3`, and \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) is less than or equal to `x + 1 = 3`.
   - It appends `1` to `subseq_lens`, subtracts \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) from `x`, and updates `mx` to 1.
   - The loop continues with `x = 1`. The next iteration finds `i = 1` again, appends `1` to `subseq_lens`, and subtracts \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) from `x`, setting `x` to 0.
   - The loop exits, and `subseq_lens` is `[1, 1]`.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed as `[0, 1]`.
   - The program prints:
     ```
     2
     0 1
     ```
   - This output is correct because the array `[0, 1]` has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, and `[1]`.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `X` is a power of 2 minus 1, as demonstrated by the example `X = 3`.
   - The program also correctly handles other cases by iteratively finding the largest power of 2 that fits into `x + 1` and constructing the array accordingly.
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200, as the maximum value of `i` (exponent) is 63 (since \(2^{63} - 1\) is the largest power of 2 minus 1 within the range of \(10^{18}\)).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was incorrect. The program does handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 minus 1 correctly and produces the correct output for `X = 3`. The program's logic and output are consistent with the problem description.

Final: **True**
