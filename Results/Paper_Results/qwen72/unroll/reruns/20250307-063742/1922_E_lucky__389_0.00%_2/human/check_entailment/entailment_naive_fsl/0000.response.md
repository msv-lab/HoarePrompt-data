Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that the input `X` might be a power of 2 minus 1, which is a valid input but the program incorrectly processes it. For example, when `X = 3` (which is \(2^2 - 1\)), the program should output an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but it incorrectly outputs an array that does not meet this requirement.

Let's test the program with `X = 3`:

Input:
```
1
3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0 1
```

Actual Output:
```
1
0
```

The actual output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`), not 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
