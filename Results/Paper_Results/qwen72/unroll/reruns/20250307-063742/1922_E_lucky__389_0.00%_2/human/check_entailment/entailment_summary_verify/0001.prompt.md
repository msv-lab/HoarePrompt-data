You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` is designed to process a single integer input `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and compute an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads `X` from the standard input, modifies it, and constructs a list `subseq_lens` of integers. After processing, it prints the length of the final list `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not affect any external variables or parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If no such array exists, print -1.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( X \) and subtracts 1 from it. This is because the problem considers an empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, so \( X - 1 \) accounts for the non-empty subsequences.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.
   - It enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - For each term \( 2^i - 1 \) that can be subtracted from \( X \), it appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and updates `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appending the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The decomposition of \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 is a valid approach to find the required array length and elements.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 and the elements are within the specified range.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. According to the problem, \( X \) is at least 2, so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed array length exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the nature of the decomposition, this should not be an issue.
   - The program does not handle the case where no valid array can be constructed, but the problem guarantees that \( X \) is at least 2, and the decomposition approach should always find a valid array.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
