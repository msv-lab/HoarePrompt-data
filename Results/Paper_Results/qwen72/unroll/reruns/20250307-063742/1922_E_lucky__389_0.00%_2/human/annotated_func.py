#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, queries):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `queries` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) for which the function needs to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop, `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where len(subseq_lens) is the length of the list `subseq_lens`)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `mx`, `t`, and `queries` remain unchanged. `x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop. `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to the end, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to process a single integer input `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and compute an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads `X` from the standard input, modifies it, and constructs a list `subseq_lens` of integers. After processing, it prints the length of the final list `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not affect any external variables or parameters.
