Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, queries):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `queries` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) for which the function needs to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `queries` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop, `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where len(subseq_lens) is the length of the list `subseq_lens`)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `mx`, `t`, and `queries` remain unchanged. `x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop. `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to the end, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to process a single integer input `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and compute an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads `X` from the standard input, modifies it, and constructs a list `subseq_lens` of integers. After processing, it prints the length of the final list `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not affect any external variables or parameters.
