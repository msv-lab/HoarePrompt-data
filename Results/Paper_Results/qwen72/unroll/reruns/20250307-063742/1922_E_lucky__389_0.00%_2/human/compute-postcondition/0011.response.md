Output State: **The values of `mx`, `t`, and `queries` remain unchanged. `x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains a list of integers representing the sequence of `i` values found during the loop. `ansv` is a list containing all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to the end, separated by spaces.**
