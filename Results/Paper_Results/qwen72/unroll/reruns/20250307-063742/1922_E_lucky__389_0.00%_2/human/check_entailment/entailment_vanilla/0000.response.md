Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If no such array exists, print -1.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( X \) and subtracts 1 from it. This is because the problem considers an empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, so \( X - 1 \) accounts for the non-empty subsequences.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.
   - It enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - For each term \( 2^i - 1 \) that can be subtracted from \( X \), it appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and updates `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appending the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The decomposition of \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 is a valid approach to find the required array length and elements.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 and the elements are within the specified range.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. According to the problem, \( X \) is at least 2, so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed array length exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the nature of the decomposition, this should not be an issue.
   - The program does not handle the case where no valid array can be constructed, but the problem guarantees that \( X \) is at least 2, and the decomposition approach should always find a valid array.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
