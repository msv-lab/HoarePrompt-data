Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the number of test cases `t` and a list of queries `queries` as parameters.
   - The function reads `x` from the standard input inside the loop, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. It should read all inputs at the beginning and pass them to the function.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The function subtracts 1 from `x` and then tries to decompose `x` into a sum of numbers of the form \(2^i - 1\). This approach is based on the idea that each \(2^i - 1\) represents the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i`.
   - The loop correctly identifies the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq x + 1\) and appends `i` to `subseq_lens`.
   - The function then constructs the array `ansv` by appending the values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1. This is incorrect because the array should be constructed based on the values in `subseq_lens` and not just from index 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.
   - However, the length of `ansv` should be the length of the array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and the elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is 1 correctly. It should return `-1` if `x` is 1 because it is impossible to have exactly 1 increasing subsequence with the given constraints.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is 0 correctly. It should return `-1` if `x` is 0 because it is impossible to have exactly 0 increasing subsequences with the given constraints.

5. **Overall Structure**:
   - The function should be called with the appropriate parameters and should handle multiple test cases.
   - The function should return the correct array or `-1` if no such array exists.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
