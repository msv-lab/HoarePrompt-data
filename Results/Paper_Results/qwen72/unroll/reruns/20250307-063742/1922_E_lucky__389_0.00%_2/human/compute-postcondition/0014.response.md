Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is designed to process a single integer input `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and compute an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads `X` from the standard input, modifies it, and constructs a list `subseq_lens` of integers. After processing, it prints the length of the final list `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not affect any external variables or parameters. **
