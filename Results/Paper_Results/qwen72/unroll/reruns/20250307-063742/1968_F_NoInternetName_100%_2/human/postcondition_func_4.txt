The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and answers `q` queries about sublists of `a`. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r` (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there is an index in the list `inds` (which maps cumulative XOR values to their indices) that satisfies certain conditions. If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values, and the state of `a`, `n`, `q`, `x`, and `inds` remains unchanged after the function execution.
