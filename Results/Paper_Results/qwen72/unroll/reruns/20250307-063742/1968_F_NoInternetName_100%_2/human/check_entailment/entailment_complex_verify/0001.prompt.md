You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting an input string provided by the user. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator ready to be consumed, which will yield the converted values as specified by the `cast` function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and answers `q` queries about sublists of `a`. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r` (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there is an index in the list `inds` (which maps cumulative XOR values to their indices) that satisfies certain conditions. If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values, and the state of `a`, `n`, `q`, `x`, and `inds` remains unchanged after the function execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1(cast)` is used to parse the input and convert it to the specified type (int in this case).
   - The function `func_5()` is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is calculated such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This is done using a loop where `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` for each element `i` in `a`.
   - The dictionary `inds` is updated to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the left and right indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the prefix XOR values `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` are equal. If they are, it means the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` can be split into two parts with the same XOR value, making it interesting.
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a valid split point, and the subarray is interesting. Otherwise, it is not.

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2(arr, predicate)` performs a binary search to find the largest index in `arr` that satisfies the predicate.
   - `func_3(arr, predicate)` is a wrapper for `func_2` and is used to find the largest index.
   - `func_4(arr, predicate)` is another wrapper for `func_2` that returns the index + 1 if a valid index is found, or 0 if no valid index is found.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated. Each element `x[i]` represents the cumulative XOR from the start of the array to the `i-1`-th element.
  - The dictionary `inds` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` correctly checks if the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
  - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find the indices for the subarray checks. However, the logic for `func_4` and `func_3` can be simplified.

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` finds the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
  - `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` finds the smallest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
  - The condition `if upper > lower` correctly checks if there is a valid split point.

### Simplification and Correctness:
- The binary search functions can be simplified for clarity, but the logic is correct.
- The program correctly handles the problem of determining if a subarray is interesting based on the prefix XOR values and the indices stored in the dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
