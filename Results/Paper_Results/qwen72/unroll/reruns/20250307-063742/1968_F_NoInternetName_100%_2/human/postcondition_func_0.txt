The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting an input string provided by the user. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator ready to be consumed, which will yield the converted values as specified by the `cast` function.
