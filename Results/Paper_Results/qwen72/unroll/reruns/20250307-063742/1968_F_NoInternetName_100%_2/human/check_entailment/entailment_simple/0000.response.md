### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a list `x` to store the cumulative XOR values.
   - A `defaultdict` `inds` is used to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR values and stores them in the list `x`.
   - It also updates the `inds` dictionary to keep track of the indices for each cumulative XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR value at the start of the subarray `x[l-1]` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at the end of the subarray `x[r]`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes' because the subarray can be split into parts where each part has a XOR value of 0.
   - If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes' because it means there is a valid split point where the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_4` are used to perform binary search on the list of indices stored in `inds`.
   - `func_4` returns the largest index in the list that is less than `l` and adds 1 to it.
   - `func_3` returns the largest index in the list that is less than or equal to `r`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by checking the conditions and using binary search to find valid split points.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses cumulative XOR values and binary search to efficiently check the conditions for each query. The logic and the implementation are sound and match the problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True****
