### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to read input and convert it to the specified type (in this case, integers). It correctly returns an iterator of integers, which is then used to initialize `n`, `q`, and the list `a`.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation (`func_5`)**:
   - The function `func_5` calculates the cumulative XOR of the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`. This is done correctly by iterating through `a` and appending the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` where the keys are the cumulative XOR values and the values are lists of indices where these XOR values appear. This is necessary to efficiently check the conditions for the queries.

3. **Query Handling (`func_5`)**:
   - For each query, the function checks if `x[l - 1] == x[r]`. If this condition is true, it means the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` has a cumulative XOR of 0, which implies that the subarray can be split into segments where the XOR of each segment is 0. This is a valid case for an interesting subarray, so it prints 'Yes'.
   - If the above condition is false, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the indices where the cumulative XOR values `x[r]` and `x[l - 1]` appear. It then checks if there is an index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and an index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper > lower`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`)**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true. This is used to find the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are helper functions that use `func_2` to find the indices. `func_4` adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`, which is necessary to adjust the index for the query conditions.

### Correctness:
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. The cumulative XOR values are calculated and stored, and the binary search is used to efficiently check the conditions for each query.
- The program handles the constraints and inputs as described in the problem statement.
- The output is correctly formatted as 'Yes' or 'No' for each query.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
