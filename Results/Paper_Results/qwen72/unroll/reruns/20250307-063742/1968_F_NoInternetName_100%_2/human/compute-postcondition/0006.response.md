Output State: **`a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `l` < `r` â‰¤ `n`, `x` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that XOR value appears in `x`.**
