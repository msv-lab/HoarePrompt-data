Reasoning:
- **func_1**: This function reads input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case. The function works correctly for the given problem, as it converts the input string into the required integer format.
- **func_2**: This function performs a binary search to find the largest index `l` in `arr` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. The function is correct and can be used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` list.
- **func_3**: This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and returns the result of the predicate evaluation. However, the output hints suggest that it should return a boolean, but the actual implementation does not. This is a discrepancy, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the overall program because `func_3` is not used in a way that relies on it returning a boolean.
- **func_4**: This function is another wrapper around `func_2`, but it adds 1 to the result if `func_2` returns a non-None value. This is useful for adjusting the index to be 1-based, which is consistent with the problem's input format.
- **func_5**: This function processes the main logic of the problem. It reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q`. It then computes the cumulative XOR values and stores them in the list `x`. The dictionary `inds` maps each cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where it occurs. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it uses `func_4` and `func_3` to check if there is a valid split point that makes the subarray interesting. The logic in `func_5` is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem of determining whether subarrays are interesting based on the provided input and queries.

Correctness: **True**
