### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1(cast)` is used to parse the input and convert it to the specified type (int in this case).
   - The function `func_5()` is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is calculated such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This is done using a loop where `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` for each element `i` in `a`.
   - The dictionary `inds` is updated to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the left and right indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the prefix XOR values `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` are equal. If they are, it means the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` can be split into two parts with the same XOR value, making it interesting.
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a valid split point, and the subarray is interesting. Otherwise, it is not.

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2(arr, predicate)` performs a binary search to find the largest index in `arr` that satisfies the predicate.
   - `func_3(arr, predicate)` is a wrapper for `func_2` and is used to find the largest index.
   - `func_4(arr, predicate)` is another wrapper for `func_2` that returns the index + 1 if a valid index is found, or 0 if no valid index is found.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated. Each element `x[i]` represents the cumulative XOR from the start of the array to the `i-1`-th element.
  - The dictionary `inds` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` correctly checks if the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
  - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find the indices for the subarray checks. However, the logic for `func_4` and `func_3` can be simplified.

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` finds the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
  - `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` finds the smallest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
  - The condition `if upper > lower` correctly checks if there is a valid split point.

### Simplification and Correctness:
- The binary search functions can be simplified for clarity, but the logic is correct.
- The program correctly handles the problem of determining if a subarray is interesting based on the prefix XOR values and the indices stored in the dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
