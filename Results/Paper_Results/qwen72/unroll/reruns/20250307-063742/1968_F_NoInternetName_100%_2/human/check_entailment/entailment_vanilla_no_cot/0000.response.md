Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1(cast)`: This function reads a line of input, splits it, and maps each element to the specified type (in this case, `int`).
   - The main function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the line `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)`.

3. **Index Mapping**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - This helps in quickly finding the indices where a particular prefix XOR value occurs.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
   - The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - If the XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` occur.
   - The `func_4` and `func_3` functions are used to perform binary search on the list of indices stored in `inds`.
   - The program then checks if there is an index in `inds[x[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and an index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" if the subarray is interesting and "No" otherwise.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly determines whether each subarray is interesting. Therefore, the program is correct.
