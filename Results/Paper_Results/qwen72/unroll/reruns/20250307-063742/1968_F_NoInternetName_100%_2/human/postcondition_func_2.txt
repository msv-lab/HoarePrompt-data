The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the boolean result of evaluating `predicate` on `arr`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` remains unchanged, and the return value is a boolean indicating the result of the predicate evaluation.
