Output State: **`a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `l` < `r` â‰¤ `n`, `x` is a list containing a single element 0, `inds` is an empty defaultdict of lists.**

The code initializes `inds` as an empty defaultdict of lists, meaning that any key accessed in `inds` will return an empty list if the key does not already exist. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
