Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of a tree represented by its adjacency list and two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines the maximum number of cuts that can be made to the tree such that the number of cuts is at most `k` and the leftover length of the tree after these cuts is at least a certain value. The function prints this maximum number of cuts for each test case. The input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` are not modified by the function, and the function does not return any value. **
