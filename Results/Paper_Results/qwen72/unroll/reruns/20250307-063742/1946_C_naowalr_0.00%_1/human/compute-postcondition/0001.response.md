The only objects in the loop head are the variable `z` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `z` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is the input integer read from stdin and must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.**
