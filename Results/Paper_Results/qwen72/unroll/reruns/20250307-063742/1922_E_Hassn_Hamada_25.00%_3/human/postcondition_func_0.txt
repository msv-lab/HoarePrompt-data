The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns 0 if `number` is 0. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of integers and modifies `sequence` such that it contains integers from 0 to `size - 1`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. It then recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. After the recursive call, it further modifies `sequence` by incrementing specific elements. The function ultimately returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. The final state of `sequence` is modified, and the function returns an integer representing the total size of the generated sequence.
