Output State: **The function description does not change any variable values directly. The variables `number` and `sequence` retain their initial values. The function is expected to return an integer representing the size of the generated sequence.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged. The variable `number` is still an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is still a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function will return an integer representing the size of the generated sequence.
