### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with \( X - 1 \) and an initially empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. This is correct because an array with 0 increasing subsequences is an empty array.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The function calculates the smallest `size` such that \( 2^{(size + 1)} - 1 \) is greater than `number`.
     - It appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
     - It recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the updated `sequence`.
     - After the recursive call, it modifies specific elements of the `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to them.
     - The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is generated by appending integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - The recursive call ensures that the sequence is modified in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The modification step ensures that the elements at specific positions are incremented, which helps in maintaining the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the function returns 0, it prints -1, indicating that no such array exists.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the base case correctly (when `number` is 0).
   - The recursive calls and modifications ensure that the sequence is generated correctly for larger values of \( X \).

7. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the sequence is at most 200, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The elements of the sequence are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The recursive approach and the modifications to the sequence are logically sound and meet the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
