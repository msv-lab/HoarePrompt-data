The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `size` being the smallest integer such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `size` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point for the range.

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sequence` retains its initial value**
