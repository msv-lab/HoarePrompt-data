The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute if `size` is greater than 0. The state of `size` and `i` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop runs. The `sequence` and `result` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `size` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
