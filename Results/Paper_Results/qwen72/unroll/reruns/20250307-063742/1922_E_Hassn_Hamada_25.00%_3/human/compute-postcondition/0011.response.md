To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- `size` remains the same.
- `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(size):
    assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates `size` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `size - 1`.

2. **Assertion**:
   - The assertion `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the index `-result - i - 1` is within the bounds of the list `sequence`.

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - The index `-result - i - 1` is negative, which means it starts from the end of the list and moves towards the beginning.
   - For the first iteration (`i = 0`), the index is `-result - 1`.
   - For the second iteration (`i = 1`), the index is `-result - 2`.
   - This continues until the last iteration (`i = size - 1`), where the index is `-result - size`.

4. **List Modification**:
   - The element at the index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.

### Example:
Let's assume `size = 3`, `sequence = [0, 1, 2]`, and `result = 1`.

- **Initial State**:
  - `size = 3`
  - `sequence = [0, 1, 2]`
  - `result = 1`

- **Loop Execution**:
  - **Iteration 1** (`i = 0`):
    - Index: `-result - 0 - 1 = -2`
    - `sequence[-2] += result` => `sequence[1] += 1` => `sequence = [0, 2, 2]`
  - **Iteration 2** (`i = 1`):
    - Index: `-result - 1 - 1 = -3`
    - `sequence[-3] += result` => `sequence[0] += 1` => `sequence = [1, 2, 2]`
  - **Iteration 3** (`i = 2`):
    - Index: `-result - 2 - 1 = -4` (This index is out of bounds, but the assertion will catch it and prevent execution if it is out of bounds)

### General Case:
- The loop will modify the elements of `sequence` starting from the end and moving towards the beginning.
- Each element at the index `-result - i - 1` will be incremented by `result`.

### Output State:
- `size` remains the same.
- `sequence` will have its elements modified as described.
- `result` remains the same.

### Natural Language Description:
- The `size` variable remains unchanged.
- The `sequence` list will have its elements from the end to the beginning modified by adding `result` to each element at the specified index.
- The `result` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`size` remains the same, `sequence` is modified such that each element at the index `-result - i - 1` (for `i` from 0 to `size - 1`) is incremented by `result`, `result` remains the same.**
