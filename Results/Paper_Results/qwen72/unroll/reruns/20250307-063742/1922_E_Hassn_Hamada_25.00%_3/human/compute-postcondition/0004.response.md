Output State: **`number` is not equal to 0, `sequence` retains its initial value, `size` is 1.** 

The variable `size` is assigned the value 1, while `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged from their initial values. The function description does not change any variable values directly, so the only change is the assignment of `size`.
