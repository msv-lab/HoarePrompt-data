Output State: **`size` remains the same, `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**. 

The value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1` which takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The first argument is calculated by subtracting `1` left-shifted by `size` from `number` and then adding `1`. The second argument is the list `sequence` which contains integers from `0` to `size - 1`. The specific value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
