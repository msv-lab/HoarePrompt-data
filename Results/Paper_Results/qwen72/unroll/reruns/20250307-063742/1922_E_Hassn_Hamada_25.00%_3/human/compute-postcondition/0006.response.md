Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. `sequence` retains its initial value.**

In natural language, the loop will continue to increment `size` until \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) exceeds the value of `number`. The final value of `size` will be the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. The variable `sequence` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
