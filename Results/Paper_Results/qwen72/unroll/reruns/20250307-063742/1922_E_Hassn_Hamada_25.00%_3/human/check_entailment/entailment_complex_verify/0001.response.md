### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and then prints the length and the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( number \) and then appends a sequence of integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the result list.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed and updates the sequence accordingly.

4. **Key Points in `func_1`**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size + 1) - 1 \) to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \). This formula calculates \( 2^{size+1} - 1 \).
   - It appends integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the updated number \( number - (1 << size) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it updates the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last \( size \) elements of the sequence.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of \( n \) distinct integers is \( 2^n - 1 \).
   - By using the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \), the function ensures that the sequence can be built to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call and the subsequent updates to the sequence ensure that the sequence is built correctly to meet the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning 0, which is correct.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built within the constraints of the problem (length at most 200 and elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).

7. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not the case in this program), it should print -1. However, the program does not handle this explicitly, but the logic ensures that a valid sequence is always generated.

8. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Initial State**: `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \le number \le 10^{18} \), and `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - **Finding the Largest Power of 2**: The loop `while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` correctly finds the smallest `size` such that \( 2^{size+1} - 1 \) is greater than `number`.
   - **Appending Initial Sequence**: The loop `for i in range(size): sequence.append(i)` correctly appends the integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the sequence.
   - **Recursive Call**: The recursive call `result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` is made with the updated number of subsequences needed.
   - **Updating Sequence**: The loop `for i in range(size): sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` correctly updates the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last \( size \) elements of the sequence.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The logic and the recursive approach are sound and meet the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
