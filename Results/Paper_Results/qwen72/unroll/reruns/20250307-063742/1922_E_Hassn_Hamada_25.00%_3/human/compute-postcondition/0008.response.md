To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial State**: `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. `sequence` retains its initial value, which we assume to be an empty list `[]`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(size):
       sequence.append(i)
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `size` times.
   - In each iteration, the value of `i` (which ranges from 0 to `size - 1`) is appended to the `sequence` list.

4. **Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `sequence` will contain all integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - The value of `size` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`size` remains the same, and `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`.**
