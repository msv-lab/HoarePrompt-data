Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of `X` for each test case.

2. **Base Case and Recursive Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

3. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function calculates the largest size `s` such that the number of increasing subsequences of an array of length `s` is less than or equal to `X - 1`.
   - It then appends the first `s` integers to the sequence.
   - The function recursively calls itself to handle the remaining part of the number of subsequences.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions in the code ensure that the sequence is being modified correctly and help in debugging.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `X` is 1 by returning a sequence of length 1 with a single element (0).

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
