You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and then prints the length and the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( number \) and then appends a sequence of integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the result list.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed and updates the sequence accordingly.

4. **Key Points in `func_1`**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size + 1) - 1 \) to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \). This formula calculates \( 2^{size+1} - 1 \).
   - It appends integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the updated number \( number - (1 << size) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it updates the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last \( size \) elements of the sequence.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of \( n \) distinct integers is \( 2^n - 1 \).
   - By using the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \), the function ensures that the sequence can be built to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call and the subsequent updates to the sequence ensure that the sequence is built correctly to meet the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning 0, which is correct.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built within the constraints of the problem (length at most 200 and elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).

7. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not the case in this program), it should print -1. However, the program does not handle this explicitly, but the logic ensures that a valid sequence is always generated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The logic and the recursive approach are sound and meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
