### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and then prints the length and the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( number \) and then appends a sequence of integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the result list.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed and updates the sequence accordingly.

4. **Key Points in `func_1`**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size + 1) - 1 \) to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \). This formula calculates \( 2^{size+1} - 1 \).
   - It appends integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the updated number \( number - (1 << size) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it updates the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last \( size \) elements of the sequence.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of \( n \) distinct integers is \( 2^n - 1 \).
   - By using the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( number \), the function ensures that the sequence can be built to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call and the subsequent updates to the sequence ensure that the sequence is built correctly to meet the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning 0, which is correct.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built within the constraints of the problem (length at most 200 and elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, but the logic ensures that a valid sequence is always generated for the given range of \( X \).

7. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not the case in this program), it should print -1. However, the program does not handle this explicitly, but the logic ensures that a valid sequence is always generated.

8. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the size of the sequence and appends the necessary elements.
   - The recursive calls and updates to the sequence are performed in a way that ensures the sequence has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence elements are within the required range, and the length of the sequence does not exceed 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The logic and the recursive approach are sound and meet the problem requirements. The function `func_1` effectively builds the sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

Final: **True**
