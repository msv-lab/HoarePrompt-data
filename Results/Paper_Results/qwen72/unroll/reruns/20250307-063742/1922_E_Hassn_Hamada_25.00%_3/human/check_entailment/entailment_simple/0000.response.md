### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (which is \( X \) in the problem statement).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and `result`.
   - After the function call, it prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria.
   - If `number` is 0, it returns 0, which is correct because an array with 0 elements has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
   - It calculates the smallest `size` such that \( 2^{(size + 1)} - 1 \) is greater than `number`.
   - It appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated `number` and `sequence`.
   - It modifies the `sequence` by incrementing specific elements by the result of the recursive call.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The logic of finding the smallest `size` such that \( 2^{(size + 1)} - 1 \) is greater than `number` is correct.
   - The recursive call and the modification of the `sequence` are intended to ensure that the sequence has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The assertion `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the indices being modified are within the bounds of the `sequence`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 2, 5, 13, and 37 as shown in the example.
   - The program should also handle the case where \( X \) is a large number up to \( 10^{18} \).

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the `result` and the elements of `result`.
   - The length of the `result` should be at most 200, and the elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should generate the required sequence for the given \( X \) values. The recursive approach and the sequence modification logic are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
