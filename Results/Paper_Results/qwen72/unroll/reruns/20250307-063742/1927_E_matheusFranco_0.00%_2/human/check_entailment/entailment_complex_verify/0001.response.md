### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - `func_1()` correctly reads \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation is constructed by placing values in positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus an offset \( i \).
   - This ensures that the values are distributed in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will differ by no more than 1.
   - The logic of incrementing `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by \( k \) ensures that the values are placed in a pattern that maintains the \( k \)-level property.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string, which is the required format.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( k \) being even.
   - The sum of \( n \) for all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), which is handled by the loop in `func_2()`.

### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - The permutation constructed is `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Sums of continuous segments of length 2: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 5 - 4 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

- For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):
  - The permutation constructed is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
  - Sums of continuous segments of length 4:
    - \( 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)
    - \( 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24 \)
    - \( 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23 \)
    - \( 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
    - \( 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23 \)
    - \( 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
    - \( 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23 \)
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 24 - 23 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program ensures that each value from 1 to \( n \) is used exactly once, thus forming a valid permutation.
- The placement of values in the permutation is done in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1, which is the key requirement for a \( k \)-level permutation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case and handles the constraints as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
