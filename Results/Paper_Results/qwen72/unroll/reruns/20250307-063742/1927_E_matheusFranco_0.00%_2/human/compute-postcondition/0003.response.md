The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user to determine the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. Since there are no explicit return statements mentioned, the function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to read the number of test cases from the user and call `func_1()` for each test case without returning any value.
Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases from the user and calls `func_1()` for each test case. It does not return any value.**
