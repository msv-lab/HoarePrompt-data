Output State: **`t` is 0.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of the variable `t` will be 0. The loop continues to run as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop condition `t > 0` becomes false, and the loop terminates. The function `func_1()` is called in each iteration, but since it doesn't modify `t` or any other variables in the loop, the only change in the output state is that `t` is reduced to 0.
