### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - In `func_1()`, the program initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation list by iterating over the range `k` and placing consecutive integers starting from 1 at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` (for `i` in range `k`).

3. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program converts the list to a string and prints it.

4. **Correctness of the Permutation:**
   - The key requirement is that the permutation should be `k`-level, meaning the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` should differ by no more than 1.
   - The program's approach of filling the permutation in a cyclic manner (i.e., placing consecutive integers at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i`) ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
   - This is because the placement of integers in a cyclic manner distributes the values evenly across the segments, ensuring that the sums of the segments are as close as possible to each other.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values within the given constraints.
   - For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program correctly outputs `2 1`, which is a valid `k`-level permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a `k`-level permutation for the given constraints and test cases. The cyclic filling approach ensures that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
