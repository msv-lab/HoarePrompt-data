Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the list with consecutive integers starting from 1, but it does so in a specific pattern: it places the integers at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` for each `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`.
   - This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1, which is the requirement for a `k`-level permutation.
   - The function prints the constructed permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, effectively handling multiple test cases as required by the problem.
   - The function does not return any value, but it correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` the appropriate number of times.

3. **Combined Analysis**:
   - The program as a whole correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_1` constructs a permutation that meets the `k`-level requirement by ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program will work within the given limits.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the required output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
