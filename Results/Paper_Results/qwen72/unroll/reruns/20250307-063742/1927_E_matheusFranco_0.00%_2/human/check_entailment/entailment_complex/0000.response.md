Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. This correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads `n` and `k` from the input and initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - The function then fills the `permutation` list in a specific pattern:
     - For each `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, it fills the indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with consecutive integers starting from 1.
     - This ensures that the elements are distributed in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

3. **Sum Calculation and Validation**:
   - The problem requires that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The construction method used in `func_1` ensures this by distributing the integers in a balanced manner across the permutation.
   - Specifically, the pattern of filling the permutation ensures that the sums of the segments are as evenly distributed as possible, which is a key requirement for a k-level permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed permutation as a space-separated string, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, including the fact that `k` is even and the range of `n` and `k` is within the specified limits.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to `k`, and the case where `n` is much larger than `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem requirements and should produce a valid k-level permutation for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
