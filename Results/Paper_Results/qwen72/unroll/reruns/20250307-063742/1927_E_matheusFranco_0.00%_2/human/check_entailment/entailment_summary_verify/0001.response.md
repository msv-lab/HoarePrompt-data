### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and correctly iterates over each test case.
   - `func_1()` reads \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case, which is correct.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation is constructed by placing values in positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus an offset \( i \).
   - This approach ensures that the values are distributed in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will differ by no more than 1.
   - The logic of incrementing `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by \( k \) ensures that the values are placed in a pattern that maintains the \( k \)-level property.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string, which is the required format.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( k \) being even.
   - The sum of \( n \) for all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), which is managed by the loop in `func_2()`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \):
     - The permutation constructed is `[1, 3, 2]`.
     - Sums of continuous segments of length 2: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
     - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 5 - 4 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.
   - For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - The permutation constructed is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
     - Sums of continuous segments of length 4:
       - \( 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)
       - \( 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24 \)
       - \( 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23 \)
       - \( 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
       - \( 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23 \)
       - \( 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
       - \( 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23 \)
     - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 24 - 23 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case and handles the constraints as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
