Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length `n` where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` (for `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1. The function prints this list as a space-separated string and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `permutation` contains the constructed sequence of integers. **
