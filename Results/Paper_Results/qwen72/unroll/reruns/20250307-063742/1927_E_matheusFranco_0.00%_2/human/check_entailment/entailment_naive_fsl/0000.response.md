Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `k` correctly. The problem description states that the permutation should be a k-level permutation, meaning that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` should differ by no more than 1. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure this property for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the input `n = 6` and `k = 4`. The expected output should be a permutation where the sums of all continuous segments of length 4 differ by no more than 1. However, the current implementation will produce a permutation like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which does not satisfy the k-level condition:

- Sums of continuous segments of length 4:
  - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
  - `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`
  - `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`

The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `18 - 10 = 8`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
