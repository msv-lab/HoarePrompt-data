To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` remain the same.
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` elements.
   - The elements at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` (for `i` in range `k`) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is `k + 1`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the `permutation` List:**
   - The `permutation` list is filled such that for each `i` in the range `k`, the elements at indices `i`, `i + k`, `i + 2k`, etc., are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - This means that the first `k` elements of `permutation` will be 1, 2, 3, ..., `k`.
   - The next `k` elements will be `k + 1`, `k + 2`, `k + 3`, ..., `2k`.
   - This pattern continues until the list is filled with `n` elements.

3. **Constructing the `result` String:**
   - The `result` string is created by joining the elements of the `permutation` list with spaces.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the `permutation` list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - The `result` string would then be `"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the construction of the `permutation` list, the output will be a string of the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

Output: **"1 2 3 ... n" (where `n` is the length of the `permutation` list and the elements are filled as described in the initial state)**
