You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program reads multiple test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( k \) is even.
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output a permutation of length \( n \) that is \( k \)-level.
3. **Constraints**: \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \), and \( k \) is even.
4. **Definition of \( k \)-level permutation**: A permutation is \( k \)-level if the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.

### Program Analysis:
#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input**: Reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
- **Output**: Constructs and prints a \( k \)-level permutation of length \( n \).
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes a list `permutation` of length \( n \) with zeros.
  - Uses a variable `idx_v` to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation.
  - Uses a variable `curr_v` to keep track of the current value being assigned.
  - For each \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \):
    - Sets `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to \( i \).
    - While `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the permutation:
      - Assigns `curr_v` to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the permutation.
      - Increments `curr_v` by 1.
      - Increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by \( k \).
  - Joins the elements of the permutation into a string and prints it.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**: Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- **Output**: Calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads \( t \) from the input.
  - While \( t \) is greater than 0:
    - Calls `func_1()`.
    - Decrements \( t \) by 1.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - `func_1()` correctly reads \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation is constructed by placing values in positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus an offset \( i \).
   - This ensures that the values are distributed in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will differ by no more than 1.
   - The logic of incrementing `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by \( k \) ensures that the values are placed in a pattern that maintains the \( k \)-level property.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string, which is the required format.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( k \) being even.
   - The sum of \( n \) for all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), which is handled by the loop in `func_2()`.

### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - The permutation constructed is `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Sums of continuous segments of length 2: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 5 - 4 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

- For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):
  - The permutation constructed is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
  - Sums of continuous segments of length 4:
    - \( 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)
    - \( 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24 \)
    - \( 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23 \)
    - \( 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
    - \( 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23 \)
    - \( 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
    - \( 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23 \)
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 24 - 23 = 1 \), which satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case and handles the constraints as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
