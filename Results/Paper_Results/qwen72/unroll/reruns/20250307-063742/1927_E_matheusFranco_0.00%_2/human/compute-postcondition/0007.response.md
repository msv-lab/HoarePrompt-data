Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` (for `i` in range `k`) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k + 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet converts each element in the `permutation` list to a string and joins them with a space, resulting in a single string stored in `result`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
- `result` is now a string that represents the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.
