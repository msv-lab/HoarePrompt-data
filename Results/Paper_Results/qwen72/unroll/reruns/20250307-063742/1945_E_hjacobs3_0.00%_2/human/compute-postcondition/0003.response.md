Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` is the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to all elements in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`.**

In natural language, the loop will adjust the values of `l` and `r` such that `l` points to the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list `array`, and `r` will be just before `l`. If `find` is not found in the list, `l` will be the index where `find` would be inserted, and `r` will be the index just before this position. If `find` is greater than all elements, `l` will be the length of the list, and `r` will be the last index. If `find` is less than or equal to all elements, `l` will be `0`, and `r` will be `-1`.
