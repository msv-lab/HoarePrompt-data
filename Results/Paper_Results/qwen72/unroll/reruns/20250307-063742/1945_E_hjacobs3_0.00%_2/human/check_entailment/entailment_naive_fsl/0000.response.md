Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to match the problem description. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm might need more than one swap to correctly position the element `x` in the permutation.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
3 3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the position of `3` and only performs one swap, which does not correctly position `3` in the permutation to be found by the binary search algorithm. The correct solution should perform two swaps to ensure that `3` is in the correct position for the binary search to find it.
