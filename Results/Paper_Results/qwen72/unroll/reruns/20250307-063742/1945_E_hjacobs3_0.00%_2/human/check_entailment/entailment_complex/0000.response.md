### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `array` and `x`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position `l` where the first element greater than or equal to `x` is located.
   - The loop continues until `l` and `r` converge, meaning `r - l = 1`.

3. **Post-Search Logic:**
   - After the loop, `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x` in the array, it prints `1` and returns a list containing the 1-based indices of `l` and the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is the index of `x`, it prints `0` and does not return anything.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly for finding the position of `x` in a sorted array.
   - However, the array is not guaranteed to be sorted, and the problem requires that the array be rearranged (with at most 2 swaps) to ensure that the binary search works correctly.

5. **Handling Unsorted Permutations:**
   - The function does not perform any swaps to rearrange the array before the binary search.
   - The function assumes that the array is already sorted or that the binary search will still work correctly on an unsorted permutation, which is incorrect.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints the number of swaps and returns the indices of the swaps.
   - However, the function does not actually perform the swaps, and the output format is not consistent with the problem's requirements. The function should return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but it prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the unsorted permutation by performing the required swaps. It also does not adhere to the expected output format, as it prints the number of swaps directly instead of returning the indices of the swaps in a consistent manner.

**Correctness: False**
