The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` in relation to the `array` and `find`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of `l` and `r` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **1**
