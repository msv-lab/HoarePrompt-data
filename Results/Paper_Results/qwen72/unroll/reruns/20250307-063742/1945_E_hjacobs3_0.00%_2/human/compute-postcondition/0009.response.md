The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the index (1-based) of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index (1-based) of `find` in `array`.**
