### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The original program uses the condition `if array[mid] >= find` to update the search range. This is incorrect because it should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly narrow down the search range.
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is also correct, but it can be more clearly written as `while r - l > 0` to match the problem description more closely.

2. **Index Handling:**
   - The original program prints the number of swaps directly within the `func_1` function, which is not ideal. The number of swaps should be printed in the main loop after calling `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of indices to swap, but it should return a tuple containing the number of swaps and the list of swaps.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The original program only performs one swap if `l` is not the correct index for `x`. This is insufficient because the problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed.
   - The corrected program includes logic to perform a second swap if the first swap does not place `x` at the correct position.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Binary Search Condition:**
  - The original condition `if array[mid] >= find` is incorrect. It should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly handle the binary search on a permutation.
  - The corrected condition `if array[mid] <= find` ensures that the search range is narrowed down correctly.

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The original loop condition `while l <= r` is correct and equivalent to `while r - l > 0`.
  - The corrected loop condition `while r - l > 0` is more explicit and aligns better with the problem description.

- **Return Values:**
  - The original function returns a list of indices to swap but prints the number of swaps within the function. This is not the best practice.
  - The corrected function returns a tuple `(k, swaps)` where `k` is the number of swaps and `swaps` is a list of tuples containing the indices to swap. This allows the main loop to handle the output correctly.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The original program only performs one swap, which is insufficient for some cases.
  - The corrected program includes logic to perform a second swap if necessary, ensuring that the final position of `x` is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the binary search condition, the return values, and the swapping logic. The corrected program addresses these issues and ensures that the number of swaps is at most 2 and that the final position of `x` is correct.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the issues identified in the original assessment are valid. The corrected program provided in the assessment is the correct solution.
