Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It performs a binary search to find the position of `find` in the sorted permutation `array`. The function returns a list of two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array` if it exists. If `find` is not found at the position `l`, the function prints `1` and returns the list as described. If `find` is found at the position `l`, the function prints `0` and does not return anything. **
