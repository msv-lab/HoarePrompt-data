Postcondition: **`l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` is the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to all elements in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
