Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of operations and the operations themselves inside the `func_1` function, which is not correct. The problem description requires that the number of operations and the operations themselves be printed in the main loop, not inside the function.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The binary search should use `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` as initial values, and the loop should continue until `r - l == 1`. The provided program uses `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`, and the loop condition is `l <= r`, which is not consistent with the problem description.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program only performs one swap if the binary search does not find the correct position. However, the problem description allows for up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.

4. **Return Value**: The function `func_1` returns a list of strings, but it should return a list of lists where each inner list contains the indices of the elements to be swapped.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(len(res))
    for op in res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, op)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return []
    
    # Find the position of x in the array
    x_pos = array.index(find) + 1
    
    # If x is not at the correct position, perform swaps
    operations = []
    if array[l - 1] != find:
        operations.append([l, x_pos])
        array[l - 1], array[x_pos - 1] = array[x_pos - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    # Perform a second swap if necessary
    if l != 1 and l != n and array[(l - 1) - 1] > array[l - 1] and array[l - 1] > array[l]:
        operations.append([l - 1, l + 1])
        array[l - 2], array[l] = array[l], array[l - 2]
    
    return operations
```

This version correctly handles the binary search and the swapping logic, and it prints the results in the required format.
