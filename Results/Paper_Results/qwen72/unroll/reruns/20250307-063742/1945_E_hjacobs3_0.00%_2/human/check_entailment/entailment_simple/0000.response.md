Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the given permutation and then swapping elements to ensure that the binary search finds the correct index of the target value `x`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_1` is implemented with a small mistake. The condition for the loop should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to avoid an infinite loop in some cases. The current implementation might not correctly converge to the correct index.

2. **Output of the Number of Operations**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) directly within the function `func_1`, which is not in line with the problem statement. The problem statement requires the number of operations to be printed before the operations themselves. This means the `print(1)` and `print(0)` statements should be moved outside the function.

3. **Handling of the Binary Search Result**: The function `func_1` returns a list of strings representing the indices to swap, but it does not handle the case where the binary search already finds the correct index. The function should return `0` and an empty list in such cases.

4. **Correctness of the Swap Logic**: The logic for swapping elements is correct in the sense that it swaps the element at the position `l` (the first position where the element is greater than or equal to `x`) with the actual position of `x` in the array. However, the function should also handle the case where `x` is not in the array, which is not possible according to the problem statement since `x` is guaranteed to be in the permutation.

Given these points, the program is not entirely correct. The binary search implementation needs to be fixed, and the output format should be adjusted to match the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
