### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search loop with the condition `while l <= r`. However, according to the problem description, the loop should terminate when `r - l = 1`, which translates to `l < r` in Python.
   - The current loop condition `l <= r` can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect termination, especially in cases where the array is not sorted.

2. **Handling Swaps**:
   - The problem description states that the binary search algorithm can be applied after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the elements in the permutation.
   - The provided function `func_1` only performs a single swap if the element `x` is not found at the position `l` after the binary search. This is insufficient to handle all cases where more than one swap might be required to correctly position `x`.

3. **Specific Test Case**:
   - The provided test case:
     ```
     1
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     2 4
     ```
   - **Actual Output**:
     ```
     1
     3 3
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - The binary search in `func_1` incorrectly identifies the position of `3` as `2` (0-based index) and only performs one swap, which does not correctly position `3` in the permutation.
     - To correctly position `3` for the binary search to find it, two swaps are needed: swapping `4` and `5` (positions 0 and 3), and then swapping `3` and `2` (positions 1 and 4).

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the binary search termination condition correctly and does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the element `x` is correctly positioned in the permutation for the binary search to find it. The original assessment accurately identifies these issues.
