Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` using binary search, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly. However, the implementation of `func_1` in the provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` should be `if array[mid] <= find:` to correctly move the search range. The current implementation will incorrectly move the `r` pointer when `array[mid]` is equal to `find`.

2. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it only prints the number of operations and returns the indices. This does not match the expected output format, which should include the number of operations on the first line followed by the indices of the swaps on subsequent lines.

3. **Handling of Correct Position**: The function checks if `l` is the correct position of `find` using `if l != array.index(find):`. This is not sufficient because `l` might not be the correct position even if `array[l] == find` due to the incorrect binary search logic.

4. **Missing Swap Logic**: The function does not perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search. The problem statement requires that you can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds the correct position of `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where `x` might be at the beginning or end of the permutation, or where the permutation is already sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
