Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated to the length of the `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation. The value of `find` remains unchanged. The initial condition that `array` is a permutation of size `n` and `find` is an integer within the range [1, `n`] is still valid.
