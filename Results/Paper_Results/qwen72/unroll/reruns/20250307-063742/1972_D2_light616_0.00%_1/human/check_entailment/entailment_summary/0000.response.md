### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to `m` while both \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) hold true.
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the GCD condition is met, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
     - The function `func_1` iterates over `x` and `y` within the bounds \(1 \le x \le \sqrt{n}\) and \(1 \le y \le m\), ensuring that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the required range.
   - **Condition 2**: \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
     - The function checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it counts the pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\).
     - However, the function does not directly check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). Instead, it uses the GCD condition to filter pairs, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm in `func_1` is not fully correct because it only checks the GCD condition and does not verify the second condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The second condition is more complex and requires a different approach to ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it only checks the GCD condition and not the second condition required for the pairs \((a, b)\).

**Correctness: False**
