### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and annotations.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
     - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - **Initialization:**
     - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
     - This is correct and necessary for counting valid pairs.
   - **Outer Loop:**
     - The outer loop iterates over possible values of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
     - This is a reasonable range because \( x \) and \( y \) are both positive integers and \( x \cdot y \) should be within the bounds of \( n \) and \( m \). However, the loop condition \( x * x <= n \) is not the most intuitive way to express this. A more clear condition would be \( x <= \sqrt{n} \), but it is functionally equivalent.
   - **Inner Loop:**
     - The inner loop iterates over possible values of \( y \) from 1 to the point where \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \).
     - This ensures that the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are within the specified bounds.
   - **GCD Check:**
     - The program checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
     - This is correct because if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), then \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) simplifies to \( b \) being a multiple of \( a + b \).
   - **Counting Valid Pairs:**
     - The program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \).
     - This is incorrect. The program should count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \). The current implementation does not correctly account for this condition. Specifically, the program should check if \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) for each pair \((a, b)\) and not just increment based on the minimum of the divisions.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
     - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the counting of valid pairs in `func_1` is incorrect. The program should check if \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) for each pair \((a, b)\) and not just increment based on the minimum of the divisions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
