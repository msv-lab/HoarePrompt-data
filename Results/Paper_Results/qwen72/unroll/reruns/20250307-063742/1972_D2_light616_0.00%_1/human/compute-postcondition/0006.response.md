The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints indicate that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since these parameters are not part of the function's input, they are likely used internally within the function. The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value cannot be determined from the provided information.**
