Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then counts the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 <= x <= sqrt(n)`, `1 <= y <= m`, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true, with the additional condition that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1. After counting, it prints the total count of such pairs. The function does not return any value. **
