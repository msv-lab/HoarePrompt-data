### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program: the `cnt` variable in `func_1` is not reset between different test cases, which can lead to incorrect results. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` `t` times.
   - This part of the program is correctly handling the input format as described in the problem.

2. **State Management in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a single pair of integers `(n, m)` and calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of valid pairs.
   - However, `cnt` is not reset to zero at the beginning of each call to `func_1`. This means that the count from the previous test case will be carried over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
     - For the first test case `(1, 1)`, the program correctly outputs `0` because there are no valid pairs.
     - For the second test case `(2, 3)`, the program should output `1` because the valid pair is `(2, 2)`. However, since `cnt` was not reset, it will output `1` (which is the correct result for the second test case) but will also carry over the `0` from the first test case, leading to an incorrect cumulative count.

   - Another example:
     ```
     2
     2 3
     1 1
     ```
     - For the first test case `(2, 3)`, the program correctly outputs `1`.
     - For the second test case `(1, 1)`, the program should output `0`, but because `cnt` is not reset, it will output `1` instead of `0`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not reset the `cnt` variable between test cases, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
