### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` starting from 1 and continues as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, each time processing a new test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The loop conditions ensure that `x` and `y` are within the bounds specified by `n` and `m`.
   - The GCD condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked to ensure that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The increment of `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for integer \(k\).

5. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case according to the problem description.
   - The logic within `func_1` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
