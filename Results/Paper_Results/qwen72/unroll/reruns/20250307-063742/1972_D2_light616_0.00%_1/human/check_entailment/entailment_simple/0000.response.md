### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to handle the input and calculate the number of valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`:
     - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
     - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
     - For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., if `x` and `y` are coprime).
     - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

3. **Conditions and Constraints:**
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not explicitly checked in the program.
   - The program instead uses the fact that if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` can be simplified to checking if `a` and `b` are coprime and then counting the valid pairs.
   - The program uses the fact that for coprime pairs, the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is given by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of counting pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and then using the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` is correct for the given problem.
   - The program ensures that `x` and `y` are within the bounds of `n` and `m` respectively.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and multiple test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, correctly outputting 0.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of its logic and handling of the problem constraints. It correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
