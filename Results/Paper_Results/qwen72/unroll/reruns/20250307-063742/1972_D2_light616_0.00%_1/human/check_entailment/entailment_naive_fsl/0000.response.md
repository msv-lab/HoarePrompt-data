Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the input format correctly. According to the problem description, the input should consist of multiple test cases, with the first line indicating the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is designed to read a single pair of integers `(n, m)` and does not account for the multiple test cases. The function `func_2` attempts to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` itself does not reset the `cnt` variable or clear any state between test cases, which can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The program will output:
```
0
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
0
1
```
But if the input is:
```
2
2 3
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
1
1
```
The correct output should be:
```
1
0
```
This shows that the program does not reset the `cnt` variable between test cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
