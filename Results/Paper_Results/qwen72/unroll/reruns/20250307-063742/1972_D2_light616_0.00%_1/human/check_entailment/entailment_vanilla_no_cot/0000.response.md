Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that would prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case, but it reads input directly from `input()`. This means that when `func_2` calls `func_1` in a loop, it will not correctly handle multiple test cases because the input reading inside `func_1` will not be synchronized with the loop in `func_2`.

2. **Output Handling**: The function `func_1` prints the result directly, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. It would be better to return the result and handle the printing in `func_2`.

3. **Efficiency**: The nested while loops in `func_1` are not efficient enough to handle the upper bounds of the problem constraints (i.e., \( n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \)). The current approach has a time complexity that is too high, and it will likely time out for large inputs.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm used in `func_1` is not correct for the given problem. The condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) is not correctly checked by the current logic. Specifically, the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is not sufficient to ensure that \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \).

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:

- Handle multiple test cases properly.
- Use a more efficient algorithm to count the valid pairs.
- Correctly implement the logic to check the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func_2()
```

This version correctly handles multiple test cases and checks the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \). However, it is still not efficient enough for the given constraints. For large values of \( n \) and \( m \), you would need to optimize the algorithm further, possibly by using number theory properties or more advanced techniques.
