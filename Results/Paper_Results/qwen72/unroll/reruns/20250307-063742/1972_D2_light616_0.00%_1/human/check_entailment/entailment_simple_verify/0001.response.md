### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates over each test case.
   - `func_1` correctly reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case. However, it reads \( n \) and \( m \) inside the function, which means it will read new input values for each test case. This is correct as per the problem description, but it should be noted that it assumes the input is provided in the correct format for each test case.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The outer loop in `func_1` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid range because \( x \) and \( y \) are both positive integers and \( x \cdot y \) should be within the bounds of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to the point where \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are within the specified bounds. However, the condition \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \) is not the most efficient way to ensure \( a \le n \) and \( b \le m \). A more efficient approach would be to directly check \( a \le n \) and \( b \le m \).

3. **GCD Check:**
   - The program checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). This is correct because if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), then \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) simplifies to \( b \) being a multiple of \( a + b \).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x \) and \( b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y \) for integer \( k \). However, the use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. The division `n / ((x + y) * x)` should be an integer division `n // ((x + y) * x)` to ensure that the count is an integer.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cnt` for each test case, which is the number of valid pairs. This is correct.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it missed the crucial detail that the division `n / ((x + y) * x)` should be an integer division `n // ((x + y) * x)` to ensure the count is an integer. This correction is necessary for the program to work correctly.

Final: **False**
