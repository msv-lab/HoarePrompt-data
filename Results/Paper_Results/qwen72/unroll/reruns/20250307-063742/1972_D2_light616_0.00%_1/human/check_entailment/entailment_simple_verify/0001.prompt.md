You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `cnt` is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
  - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
  - \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - For each \( x \), it iterates over possible values of \( y \) from 1 to the point where \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \).
   - It checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
   - If \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Reasoning:
- **Input Handling:**
  - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates over each test case.
  - `func_1` correctly reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.

- **Loop Conditions:**
  - The outer loop in `func_1` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid range because \( x \) and \( y \) are both positive integers and \( x \cdot y \) should be within the bounds of \( n \) and \( m \).
  - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to the point where \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are within the specified bounds.

- **GCD Check:**
  - The program checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). This is correct because if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), then \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) simplifies to \( b \) being a multiple of \( a + b \).

- **Counting Valid Pairs:**
  - The program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x \) and \( b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y \) for integer \( k \).

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the value of `cnt` for each test case, which is the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The input handling, loop conditions, GCD check, and counting of valid pairs are all implemented correctly.
