Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the predefined function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes. The function itself does not return any value, but the overall postconditions are determined by the behavior of `func_1`. **
