You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `cnt` is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, but it assumes that `func_1` is defined and can handle the input and output for each test case.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` is called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the input format correctly. According to the problem description, the input should consist of multiple test cases, with the first line indicating the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is designed to read a single pair of integers `(n, m)` and does not account for the multiple test cases. The function `func_2` attempts to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` itself does not reset the `cnt` variable or clear any state between test cases, which can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The program will output:
```
0
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
0
1
```
But if the input is:
```
2
2 3
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
1
1
```
The correct output should be:
```
1
0
```
This shows that the program does not reset the `cnt` variable between test cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
