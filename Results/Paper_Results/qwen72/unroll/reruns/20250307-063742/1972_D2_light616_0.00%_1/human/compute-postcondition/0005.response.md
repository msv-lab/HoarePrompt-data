To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - `cnt` is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `x` is defined as the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This means if `n` is a perfect square, `x` will be the next integer. For example, if `n = 9`, then `x = 4` (since the square root of 9 is 3, and the smallest integer greater than 3 is 4).
   - `cnt` is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy certain conditions within a loop. The exact conditions are not provided, but we know that `cnt` is incremented based on these conditions.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.
   - Since the exact conditions for incrementing `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of the pairs (x, y) that satisfy the loop conditions.

Given the information, the output will be the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions within the loop)**
