Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order, `answers` is a list containing the initial pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) plus any pairs formed by combining the ranks from the trump suit with the suits that are not the trump suit, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16, `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S', `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description, and `suits` remains a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
