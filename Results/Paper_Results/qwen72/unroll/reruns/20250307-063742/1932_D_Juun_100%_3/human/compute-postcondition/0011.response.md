Output State: **`trumps` is now an empty list, `answers` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trump_suit` remains unchanged, `cards` remains unchanged, and `suits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until the `trumps` list is empty. In each iteration, the loop removes two elements from the `trumps` list and prints them with the `trump` variable appended to each. Once the loop has finished, `trumps` will be an empty list. The other variables (`answers`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `suits`) are not modified within the loop, so they remain in their initial states.
