You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2' to '9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') and all cards are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `answers` is a list containing strings that represent pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit), where the pairs are formed by sorting the ranks. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of the cards that belong to the trump suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `answers` is a list containing the initial pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) plus any pairs formed by combining the ranks from the trump suit with the suits that are not the trump suit. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is an empty list if it initially had enough ranks to form pairs with all non-trump suits, otherwise it remains with the leftover ranks. `suits` remains a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is now an empty list, `answers` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trump_suit` remains unchanged, `cards` remains unchanged, and `suits` remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is now an empty list, `answers` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trump_suit` remains unchanged, `cards` remains unchanged, and `suits` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards`, each describing a card with a rank ('2' to '9') and a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). It returns the result of a card game based on the provided cards and the trump suit.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
