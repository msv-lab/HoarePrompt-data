#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2' to '9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') and all cards are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `answers` is a list containing strings that represent pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit), where the pairs are formed by sorting the ranks. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of the cards that belong to the trump suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:

    #State: `answers` is a list containing the initial pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) plus any pairs formed by combining the ranks from the trump suit with the suits that are not the trump suit. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is an empty list if it initially had enough ranks to form pairs with all non-trump suits, otherwise it remains with the leftover ranks. `suits` remains a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is now an empty list, `answers` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trump_suit` remains unchanged, `cards` remains unchanged, and `suits` remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is now an empty list, `answers` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trump_suit` remains unchanged, `cards` remains unchanged, and `suits` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, including the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique card descriptions. It processes these cards to form pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) and pairs of cards where one card is from a non-trump suit and the other is from the trump suit. The function prints these pairs in a sorted and formatted manner. If there are not enough trump cards to form pairs with all non-trump suits, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. After processing, the function ensures that all cards are paired and prints the pairs, with the trump cards being used first in descending order of their ranks.
