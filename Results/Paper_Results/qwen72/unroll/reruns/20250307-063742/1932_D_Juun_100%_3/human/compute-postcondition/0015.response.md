The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings `cards`, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2' to '9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') and all cards are unique.

The function returns the result of a card game based on the provided parameters. The exact return value is not specified, but it is implied that the function will determine the winner or the outcome of the game based on the cards and the trump suit.
