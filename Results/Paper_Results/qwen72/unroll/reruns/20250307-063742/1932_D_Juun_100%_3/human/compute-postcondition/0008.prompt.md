Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `answers` is a list containing strings that represent pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit), where the pairs are formed by sorting the ranks. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of the cards that belong to the trump suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
