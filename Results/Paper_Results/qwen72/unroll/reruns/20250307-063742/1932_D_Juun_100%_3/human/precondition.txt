t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is a two-character string with the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS").
