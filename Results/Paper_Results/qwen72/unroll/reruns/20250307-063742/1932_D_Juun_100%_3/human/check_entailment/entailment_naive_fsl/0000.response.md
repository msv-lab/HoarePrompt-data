Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit but no higher-ranked card to beat them. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
S
3C 4C 5C 6D 7D 8D
```

In this case, the program will attempt to pair the non-trump cards (6D, 7D, 8D) with the trump cards (3C, 4C, 5C), but there are no higher-ranked trump cards to beat the non-trump cards. The program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" because it cannot find a suitable trump card to beat the non-trump cards. However, a valid solution exists:

```
3C 4C
5C 6D
7D 8D
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, leading to an incorrect output in some cases.
