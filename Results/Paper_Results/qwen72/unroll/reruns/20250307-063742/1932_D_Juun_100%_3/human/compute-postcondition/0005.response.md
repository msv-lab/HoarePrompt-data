To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which is `card`. The loop will iterate over the elements provided by `input().split()`. For the loop to execute, the input must provide at least one card description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variable `card`, which will take values from the list produced by `input().split()`.
2. For the loop to execute, `input().split()` must return a list with at least one element.
3. The state of `card` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but it will be assigned the first element of the list produced by `input().split()` upon the first iteration.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input provided to `input().split()` to ensure it is not empty.

Given that the input is not part of the initial state provided, we can only ensure that the loop will execute by stating that the input must provide at least one card description.

State: **`card` will be the first element of the list produced by `input().split()`, and `input().split()` must return a list with at least one element**
