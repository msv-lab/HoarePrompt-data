Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the initial pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) plus any pairs formed by combining the ranks from the trump suit with the suits that are not the trump suit. `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16. `trump_suit` remains one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'. `cards` remains a list of 2n unique strings where each string is a two-character card description. `trumps` is an empty list if it initially had enough ranks to form pairs with all non-trump suits, otherwise it remains with the leftover ranks. `suits` remains a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values are `None` for all suits except the trump suit, which is not tracked in this dictionary.**
