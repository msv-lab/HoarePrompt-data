The function `func_1` reads input from the user, including the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique card descriptions. It processes these cards to form pairs of cards from the same suit (excluding the trump suit) and pairs of cards where one card is from a non-trump suit and the other is from the trump suit. The function prints these pairs in a sorted and formatted manner. If there are not enough trump cards to form pairs with all non-trump suits, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. After processing, the function ensures that all cards are paired and prints the pairs, with the trump cards being used first in descending order of their ranks.
