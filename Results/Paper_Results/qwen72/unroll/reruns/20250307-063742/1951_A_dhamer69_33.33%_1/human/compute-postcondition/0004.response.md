Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. The function then checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if the count of '1' in `s` is odd or if the substring '11' appears exactly once, it prints 'NO'. In all other cases, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and any external variables like `start` and `end` remain unchanged. **
