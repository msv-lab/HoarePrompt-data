It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct this and provide the precondition for the correct function definition.

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
