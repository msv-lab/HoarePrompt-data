### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - However, Bob cannot pick the same element that Alice just picked, as it would be already removed from `a`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer.
   - It uses a `while` loop to check if the current `start` value is in the `nums` counter.
   - If `start` is in `nums`, it adds `start` to the `vis` set and decreases its count in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it decreases its count and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` is not in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the MEX of `c`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` by checking the `nums` counter.
   - The `vis` set is not necessary for this problem, as the MEX is determined by the smallest missing integer in `nums`.
   - The logic of decrementing the count and incrementing `start` is correct for finding the MEX.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `start + 1` is not in `nums` by printing `start + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same by correctly identifying the MEX.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The function ensures that both players play optimally by always picking the smallest available element.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest element to maximize the MEX, and Bob will pick the next smallest element to minimize it.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

- **Function `func_1` Execution:**
  - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This line correctly initializes a counter to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
  - `start = 0`: This initializes the starting point for finding the MEX.
  - `vis = set()`: This set is not necessary for the MEX calculation but does not affect the correctness of the program.
  - `while nums.get(start, 0)`: This loop continues as long as the current `start` value is present in `nums`.
  - `vis.add(start)`: This line adds the current `start` value to the `vis` set, which is unnecessary.
  - `nums[start] -= 1`: This correctly decrements the count of the current `start` value.
  - `if nums.get(start + 1, 0)`: This checks if the next integer (`start + 1`) is present in `nums`.
  - `nums[start + 1] -= 1`: This correctly decrements the count of the next integer.
  - `start += 1`: This increments `start` to the next integer.
  - `else: print(start + 1); return`: This correctly prints `start + 1` and returns when the next integer is not present in `nums`.
  - `print(start)`: This prints the last processed `start` value, which is the MEX if the loop completes without finding a missing integer.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The unnecessary `vis` set does not affect the correctness of the program, and the logic for decrementing the count and incrementing `start` is correct.

Final: **True**
