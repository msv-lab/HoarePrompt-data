To determine what will be printed by the `print(start)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **`vis` set**: This set contains all the indices that were visited during the loop execution.
2. **`nums` Counter object**: This object has been updated to reflect the decremented frequencies of the visited indices and their subsequent indices.
3. **`start` variable**: This variable will be the last index that was processed in the loop.

Given this information, the `print(start)` statement will print the value of `start`, which is the last index that was processed in the loop.

Since the exact indices visited and the specific values in the `nums` Counter object are not provided, we can only describe `start` in terms of the loop execution. The value of `start` will be the last index that was processed, which is typically the highest index in the `vis` set or the last index that met the loop's termination condition.

Output: **start (where start is the last index that was processed in the loop)**
