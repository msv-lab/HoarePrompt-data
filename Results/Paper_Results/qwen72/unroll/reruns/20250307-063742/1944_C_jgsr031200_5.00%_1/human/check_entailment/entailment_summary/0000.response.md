Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice appending an element to `c` and Bob removing an element from `a`. The goal is to determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` when the game ends.

The provided program uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each integer in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the integers starting from 0, attempting to simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The key points to consider are:

1. **Optimal Play Simulation**: The program simulates the optimal play by checking if the current integer `start` is present in the array. If it is, it adds it to the set `vis` and decreases its count in the `Counter` `nums`. If the next integer (`start + 1`) is also present, it decreases its count and increments `start`. This process continues until an integer is not found in the array, at which point the program prints `start + 1` as the MEX.

2. **Handling of MEX Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present in the array `c` by checking the presence of each integer starting from 0. If an integer is found, it is removed from the array, and the process continues. If an integer is not found, the program prints the next integer (`start + 1`), which is the MEX.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the array might be empty or contain only one element. For example, if the array contains only one element, the MEX will be 1 if the element is 0, and 0 otherwise.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating through each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX for the array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
