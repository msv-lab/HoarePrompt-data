Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly handle the game's logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. The function `func_1` only iterates through the array once, decrementing the count of elements in the `nums` counter and adjusting the `start` variable. However, the game involves multiple turns where Alice and Bob alternately pick elements from the array, and the final score is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been picked.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice picks `2` (array `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`, array `c` becomes `[2]`).
- Bob picks `0` (array `a` becomes `[1, 2]`, array `c` remains `[2]`).
- Alice picks `1` (array `a` becomes `[2]`, array `c` becomes `[2, 1]`).
- Bob picks `2` (array `a` becomes `[]`, array `c` becomes `[2, 1]`).

The final array `c` is `[2, 1]`, and the MEX of `[2, 1]` is `3`. However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

The program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob more accurately to ensure that the final score is correctly calculated.
