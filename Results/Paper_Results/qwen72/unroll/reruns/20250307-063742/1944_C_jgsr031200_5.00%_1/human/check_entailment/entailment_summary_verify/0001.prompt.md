You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It processes the list to find a sequence of indices that can be visited based on the values in the list. The function prints the first index that cannot be visited in the sequence and returns. If all indices can be visited, it prints the length of the list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies a `Counter` object that tracks the frequency of each integer in the list. The final state of the program includes a set `vis` that contains all the visited indices and a `Counter` object `nums` with updated frequencies.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - However, Bob cannot pick the same element that Alice just picked, as it would be already removed from `a`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer.
   - It uses a `while` loop to check if the current `start` value is in the `nums` counter.
   - If `start` is in `nums`, it adds `start` to the `vis` set and decreases its count in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it decreases its count and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` is not in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the MEX of `c`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` by checking the `nums` counter.
   - The `vis` set is not necessary for this problem, as the MEX is determined by the smallest missing integer in `nums`.
   - The logic of decrementing the count and incrementing `start` is correct for finding the MEX.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `start + 1` is not in `nums` by printing `start + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same by correctly identifying the MEX.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The function ensures that both players play optimally by always picking the smallest available element.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest element to maximize the MEX, and Bob will pick the next smallest element to minimize it.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
