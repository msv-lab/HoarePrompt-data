Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the optimal MEX score of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played their game. The key points to consider are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for calculating the MEX score of the game. It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The `start` variable is initialized to 0, and the loop continues as long as the current `start` value exists in the `nums` counter.
   - Alice will always choose the smallest available integer to append to `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will choose the next smallest integer to remove from `a` to minimize the MEX.
   - The loop updates the `nums` counter by decrementing the count of the chosen integer and the next integer (if it exists).

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The loop continues until `start` is no longer in `nums` or the next integer (`start + 1`) is not in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` is not in `nums`, the program prints `start + 1` and returns, which is the correct MEX value.
   - If the loop exits because `start` is no longer in `nums`, the program prints `start`, which is also the correct MEX value.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `arr` is empty or contains only one element.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The strategy implemented in the program ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always choosing the smallest available integer, which is a valid and optimal approach for this problem.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX score of the game when both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
