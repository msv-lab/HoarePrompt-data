Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes `vis` as an empty set, which will be used to keep track of visited elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
