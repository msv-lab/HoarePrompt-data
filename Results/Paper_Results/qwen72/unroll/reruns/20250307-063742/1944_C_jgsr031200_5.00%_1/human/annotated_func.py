#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The `vis` set contains all the indices that were visited during the loop execution, and the `nums` Counter object has been updated to reflect the decremented frequencies of the visited indices and their subsequent indices. The `start` variable will be the last index that was processed, and the loop will print `start + 1` and return.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last index that was processed in the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It processes the list to find a sequence of indices that can be visited based on the values in the list. The function prints the first index that cannot be visited in the sequence and returns. If all indices can be visited, it prints the length of the list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies a `Counter` object that tracks the frequency of each integer in the list. The final state of the program includes a set `vis` that contains all the visited indices and a `Counter` object `nums` with updated frequencies.
