Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The key points to consider are:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c` to delay the appearance of the smallest missing integer.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to remove small integers from `a` to prevent Alice from including them in `c`.

The given program attempts to simulate the optimal play by both players. Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited indices.
   - The loop continues as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums` (i.e., there is at least one occurrence of `start` in `arr`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It adds `start` to the `vis` set.
     - It decrements the count of `start` in `nums`.
     - If the next integer (`start + 1`) exists in `nums`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
     - If the next integer (`start + 1`) does not exist in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
   - If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, it prints `start`.

3. **Optimal Play Simulation**:
   - The program correctly simulates the optimal play by both players. Alice will always choose the smallest available integer to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to remove the smallest available integer to minimize the MEX.
   - The use of the `Counter` and the loop ensures that the program efficiently finds the smallest missing integer.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing `n` (which is the correct MEX in this case).
   - It also handles the case where the smallest integer is missing from the start by printing the correct MEX.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of O(n) due to the use of the `Counter` and the single pass through the array, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by simulating the optimal play of both Alice and Bob and finding the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
