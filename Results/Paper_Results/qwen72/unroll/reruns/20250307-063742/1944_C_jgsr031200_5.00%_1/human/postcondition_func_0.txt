The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It processes the list to find a sequence of indices that can be visited based on the values in the list. The function prints the first index that cannot be visited in the sequence and returns. If all indices can be visited, it prints the length of the list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies a `Counter` object that tracks the frequency of each integer in the list. The final state of the program includes a set `vis` that contains all the visited indices and a `Counter` object `nums` with updated frequencies.
