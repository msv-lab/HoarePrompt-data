To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `nums.get(start, 0)`. This condition checks if the value associated with `start` in the `nums` Counter object is non-zero. If it is non-zero, the loop will execute.

Let's break down the state and the condition:

- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

The loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)` will evaluate to `nums.get(0, 0)`, which means it will check the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0. This means that the integer 0 must be present in `arr` and have a non-zero frequency in `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is 0.
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `nums.get(0, 0)` is greater than 0. This can be achieved by ensuring that the integer 0 is present in `arr`.

Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`start` and `nums`), we need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is greater than 0. This can be done by ensuring that `arr` contains at least one 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr` and `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
