The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, it ensures that `t` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `z` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0**
