The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`.**
