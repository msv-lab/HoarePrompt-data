Output State: **The value of `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has run, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each test case according to the conditions in the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` for the last test case will be the final values in the output state.**
