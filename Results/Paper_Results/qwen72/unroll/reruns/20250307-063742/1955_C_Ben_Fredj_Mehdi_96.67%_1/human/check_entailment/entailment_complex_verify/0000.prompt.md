You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The value of `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has run, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each test case according to the conditions in the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` for the last test case will be the final values in the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function prints a single integer that represents the number of elements in `a` that can be reduced to zero by performing a series of operations, where each operation consists of decrementing two elements of `a` by 1, up to a total of `k` decrements. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, the function prints the length of `a`. If specific values of `n` and `k` match certain predefined conditions, the function prints a predefined result. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the final state is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` for the last test case are the final values in the output state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a series of hardcoded conditions that check for specific values of `k` and `n`, and return a fixed output for those cases. This approach is not general and will fail for many other inputs. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 4
1 2 1
```

Expected output: `2`

The program will not handle this case correctly because it does not follow the logic described in the problem. Instead, it will fall into the `else` block and execute the loop, which may not produce the correct result for all cases. The hardcoded conditions are a significant flaw, as they do not account for the dynamic nature of the problem where the number of ships and the number of attacks can vary widely.
