Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the area is flawed. The program calculates the squared distance between two points and then multiplies the square roots of two such distances, which is not the correct way to find the area of a square. The correct approach would be to find the side length of the square and then square it.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The correct area of the square is 9, but the program will output a different value because it incorrectly calculates the area.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the coordinates are not in the expected order, which can lead to incorrect results. The coordinates should be sorted in a way that ensures the correct side length is calculated, but the current sorting method does not guarantee this.
