Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined mechanism (e.g., standard input) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
def func():

    n = int(input())
     
    while n :
        
        l = int(input())
        s = 0
        s += (l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2
        print(s)
        n-=1
     
            
    """
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
        
        res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
        
        print(round(res))
        
        n -= 1
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the value of `n` is 0. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square. The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads four pairs of integer coordinates. After processing all test cases, the value of `n` is 0, and the function concludes.
