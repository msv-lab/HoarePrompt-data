The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters, but it processes input through a predefined mechanism (e.g., standard input). The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each coordinate (x_i, y_i) is an integer where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

The function returns the area of the square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each test case.**
