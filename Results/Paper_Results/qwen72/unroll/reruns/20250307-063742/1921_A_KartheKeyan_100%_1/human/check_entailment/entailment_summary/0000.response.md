Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading four pairs of coordinates for each square.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The program sorts the coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates as tuples may not necessarily place them in the correct order for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The correct approach would be to sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately to ensure that the points are in the correct order.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the points. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between the second and first points (`p1`) and the squared distance between the fourth and third points (`p2`). For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners should be the same, and the distance between opposite corners should be the diagonal of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2` and then multiplying them. This is incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared. Since `p1` and `p2` are the squared distances between adjacent points, the area should be `p1` (or `p2`, since they should be equal).

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated area for each test case. However, due to the incorrect area calculation, the output is likely to be incorrect.

Given these points, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The correct approach would be to calculate the side length by finding the distance between two adjacent points and then squaring that distance.

Correctness: **False**
