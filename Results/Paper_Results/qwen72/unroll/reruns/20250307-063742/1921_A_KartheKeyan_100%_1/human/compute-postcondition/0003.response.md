Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the value of `n` is 0. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it processes a set of coordinates, calculates a result, and prints it. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. Once the loop has run `n` times, `n` becomes 0, and the loop terminates. The variables `t` and `s` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
