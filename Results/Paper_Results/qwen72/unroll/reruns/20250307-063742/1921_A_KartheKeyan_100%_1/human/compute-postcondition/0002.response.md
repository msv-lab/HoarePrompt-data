The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the integer value input by the user. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `l` is an integer input representing the side length of the square, and `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. The value of `s` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, `n` must be a non-zero integer.**
