Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The program sorts the coordinates. This is a reasonable approach because sorting the coordinates of a square with sides parallel to the axes will group the x-coordinates and y-coordinates in a way that makes it easy to identify the side lengths.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first two points and the last two points. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the axes, the distance between the first two points (after sorting) should be the same as the distance between the last two points. However, the program calculates the squared distances, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of the squared distances and then multiplying them. This is incorrect because the area of a square is simply the side length squared. The program should not take the square root of the distances and then multiply them; instead, it should just use one of the squared distances as the area.

5. **Output**: The program rounds the result before printing it. This is unnecessary because the area should be an integer.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. The correct approach would be to calculate the side length of the square directly from the sorted coordinates and then print the side length squared.

Correctness: **False**
