Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this can lead to incorrect results because the coordinates of the square's corners are not necessarily ordered in a way that makes the sorting meaningful for calculating the side length. Sorting the coordinates can mix up the x and y values in a way that does not preserve the structure of the square.

2. **Calculating the Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square by computing the distance between two points that are adjacent in the sorted list. However, this approach is flawed because the sorted list does not guarantee that the points are adjacent in the context of the square's geometry. For example, if the coordinates are sorted, the points might not be in the correct order to form the sides of the square.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of the distances and then multiplying them. This is unnecessary and incorrect. The area of a square is simply the side length squared.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you should:

1. **Extract the x and y coordinates**: Collect all the x and y coordinates separately.
2. **Find the unique x and y values**: Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the unique x and y values will give you the side lengths.
3. **Calculate the area**: The area of the square is the side length squared.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        x_coords = []
        y_coords = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            x_coords.append(x)
            y_coords.append(y)
        
        # Find the unique x and y values
        side_length_x = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        side_length_y = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        
        # The side length of the square should be the same in both dimensions
        if side_length_x != side_length_y:
            print("Error: The points do not form a square.")
        else:
            area = side_length_x ** 2
            print(area)
        
        n -= 1

# Example usage
# func()
```

This program correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the unique x and y values and ensuring that the side lengths are the same. If the side lengths are not the same, it prints an error message, which is a good practice to handle unexpected input. However, since the problem guarantees that the input forms a valid square, the error check is not strictly necessary.
