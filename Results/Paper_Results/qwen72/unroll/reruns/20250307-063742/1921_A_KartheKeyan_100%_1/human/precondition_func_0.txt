The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined mechanism (e.g., standard input) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
