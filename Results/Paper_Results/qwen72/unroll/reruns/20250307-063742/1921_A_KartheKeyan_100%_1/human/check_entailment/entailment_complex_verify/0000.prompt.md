You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined mechanism (e.g., standard input) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the value of `n` is 0. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square. The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads four pairs of integer coordinates. After processing all test cases, the value of `n` is 0, and the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the area is flawed. The program calculates the squared distance between two points and then multiplies the square roots of two such distances, which is not the correct way to find the area of a square. The correct approach would be to find the side length of the square and then square it.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The correct area of the square is 9, but the program will output a different value because it incorrectly calculates the area.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the coordinates are not in the expected order, which can lead to incorrect results. The coordinates should be sorted in a way that ensures the correct side length is calculated, but the current sorting method does not guarantee this.
