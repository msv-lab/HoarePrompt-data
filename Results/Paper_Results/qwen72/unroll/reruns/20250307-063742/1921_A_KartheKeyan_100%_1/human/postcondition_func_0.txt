The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square. The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads four pairs of integer coordinates. After processing all test cases, the value of `n` is 0, and the function concludes.
