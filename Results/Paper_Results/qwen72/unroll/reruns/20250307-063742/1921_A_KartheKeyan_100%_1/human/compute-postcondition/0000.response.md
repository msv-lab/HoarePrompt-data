Output State: **The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `l` is an integer input representing the side length of the square, and `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. The value of `s` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, `n` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `n` is initialized to the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, `l` is read from the input.
- `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.
- The value of `s` is printed.
- `n` is decremented by 1 after each test case.
- After processing all test cases, `n` becomes 0.
