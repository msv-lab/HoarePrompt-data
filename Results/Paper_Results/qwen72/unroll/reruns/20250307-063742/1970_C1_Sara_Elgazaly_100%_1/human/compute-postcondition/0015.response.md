The function `func` accepts parameters that include an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` edges. The integer `n` is constrained such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each edge is a tuple of two integers `(u, v)` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree represented by these edges has exactly two leaves. Additionally, the function accepts a starting node `u_1` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.

The function returns the path from the starting node `u_1` to one of the leaves of the tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a list of `n-1` edges representing a tree with exactly two leaves, and a starting node `u_1`. It returns the path from the starting node `u_1` to one of the leaves of the tree.**
