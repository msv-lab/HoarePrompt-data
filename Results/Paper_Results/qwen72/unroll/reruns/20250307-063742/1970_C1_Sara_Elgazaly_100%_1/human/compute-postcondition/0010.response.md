Output State: **`lst` will have the same structure as the initial state, but the lists associated with the keys that were traversed will be empty. `rev` remains unchanged. `n`, `u_1`, and `y` remain unchanged. `z` remains unchanged. `tmp` will be the last key in the traversal chain that has an empty list. `one` will be `False` if the number of iterations is odd, and `True` if the number of iterations is even. `two` is `True`.**
