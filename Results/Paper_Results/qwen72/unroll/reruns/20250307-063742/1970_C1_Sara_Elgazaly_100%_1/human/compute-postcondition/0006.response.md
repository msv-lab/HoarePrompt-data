Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `lst` will contain `x-1` new entries where each key `a` will have a list of values `b` that were appended during the loop. Similarly, `rev` will contain `x-1` new entries where each key `b` will have a list of values `a` that were appended during the loop. The values of `n`, `u_1`, and `y` remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, and `tmp` is equal to `z`.**
