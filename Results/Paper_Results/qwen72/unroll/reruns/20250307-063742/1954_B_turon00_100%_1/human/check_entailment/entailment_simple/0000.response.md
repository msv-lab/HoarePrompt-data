### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` to store the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Loop to Count Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array length `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n` (meaning all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. This is done by identifying the longest segment of consecutive identical elements and considering the minimum length of such segments.
- However, the logic has a flaw: it only considers the segments of consecutive identical elements starting from the first element. It does not account for segments that start from other positions in the array.
- For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the segment `[1, 1, 1]` and not the segment `[2, 2]`. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly handle all possible segments of consecutive identical elements in the array. It only considers segments starting from the first element, which is insufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
