Output State: **The function takes no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of length n where each element a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
