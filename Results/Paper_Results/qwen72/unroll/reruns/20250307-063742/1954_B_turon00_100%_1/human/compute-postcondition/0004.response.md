Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same in the array `a`, excluding the entire array length if all elements are the same. If the array length `n` is 1 or if all elements in the array are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant. **
