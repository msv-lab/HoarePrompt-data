Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the output is either `-1` if the array length `n` is 1 or if all elements in the array are the same, or the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, excluding the entire array length. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.**
