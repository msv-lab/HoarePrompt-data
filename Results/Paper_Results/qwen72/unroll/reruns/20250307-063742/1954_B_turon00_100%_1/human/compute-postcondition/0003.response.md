The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of processing these test cases. Since the specific output is not provided in the problem description, we can infer that the function likely returns some form of analysis or computation based on the array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns the result of some computation or analysis based on the array `a` for each test case.**
