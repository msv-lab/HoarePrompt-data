### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` to store the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same.

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The function iterates through the array `a` and counts consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array length `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n` (meaning all elements are the same), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**:
  - If all elements in the array are the same, the function will set `ans` to `n` and then check if `ans == n`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct because removing any element will not stop the array from being beautiful.

- **Case 2: Array Length is 1**:
  - If the array length is 1, the function prints `-1`, which is correct because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Case 3: General Case**:
  - The function correctly identifies the minimum count of consecutive identical elements and prints this count. This is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to potentially break the beauty of the array.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and where all elements are the same correctly.
  - However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. Since the problem guarantees that the array is beautiful, this is not an issue.

- **Consecutive Elements**:
  - The function correctly identifies the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, which is the key to determining the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:

The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all the specified edge cases and the general case appropriately.
