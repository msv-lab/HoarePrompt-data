Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` is already not beautiful because there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`. According to the problem description, the output should be `-1` in this case, but the program will incorrectly output `1`.

The program assumes that the array is always beautiful and tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful. However, it does not check if the array is already not beautiful, which is a necessary condition to meet the problem's requirements.
