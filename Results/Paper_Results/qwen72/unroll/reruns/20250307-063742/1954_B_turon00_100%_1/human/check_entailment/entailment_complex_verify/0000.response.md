Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. The problem description guarantees that the input array is beautiful, but the program should still check if it is possible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the array is already not beautiful, the program should output `-1`.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Assumption of Beauty**: The program assumes that the array is always beautiful and tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful. However, the problem description states that the array is guaranteed to be beautiful, but the program should still check if it is possible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Incorrect Output for Non-Beautiful Arrays**: For an array that is already not beautiful, the program will incorrectly output a value other than `-1`. For example, with the input:
   ```
   1
   5
   1 2 3 2 1
   ```
   The array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` is already not beautiful because there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`. According to the problem description, the output should be `-1` in this case, but the program will output `1`.

3. **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same and uses this to determine the number of elements to remove. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility that the array might already be not beautiful.

To correct this, the program should include a check to determine if the array is already not beautiful. If it is, the program should output `-1`. If it is beautiful, the program should then proceed to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful.

Final: **False**
