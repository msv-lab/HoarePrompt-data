You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of length n where each element a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the output is either `-1` if the array length `n` is 1 or if all elements in the array are the same, or the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, excluding the entire array length. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same in the array `a`, excluding the entire array length if all elements are the same. If the array length `n` is 1 or if all elements in the array are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using the operation of replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. **Task**: Given a beautiful array, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array \(a\).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to \(n\) to store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array.
   - If the current element \(a[i]\) is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element \(a[i]\) is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - If \(n\) is 1 or `ans` is equal to \(n\), the program prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Single Element Array**:
   - If \(n = 1\), the array is trivially beautiful, and it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. The program correctly prints -1.

2. **All Elements the Same**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, the array is beautiful, and it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. The program correctly prints -1.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program aims to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and can be removed to break the beauty of the array.
   - The logic of updating `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` ensures that the program finds the smallest segment of consecutive elements that can be removed.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should output 1 (by removing the last element), but it might not correctly handle this case if the logic for updating `ans` is flawed.

### Flaw Identification:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. It only updates `ans` based on the minimum segment of consecutive elements, which might not always be the correct approach to break the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can break the beauty of the array by removing the minimum number of elements. This involves checking if there is any segment where removing elements will prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
