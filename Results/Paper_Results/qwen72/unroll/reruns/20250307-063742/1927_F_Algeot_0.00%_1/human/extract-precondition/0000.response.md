Precondition: **The function `func` is supposed to process multiple test cases of undirected weighted graphs. Each graph is defined by a set of vertices and edges, with the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` satisfying 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5). Each edge is represented by a tuple (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function should find a simple cycle in each graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimal. The input is structured such that the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and each test case is followed by the graph's edges. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and each graph is guaranteed to contain at least one simple cycle.**
