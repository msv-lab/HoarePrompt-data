You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.

    #State: i = w, M contains all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1, and their corresponding complementary divisors (q // i) that are also greater than or equal to x - 1.
    return M
    #The program returns M, which contains all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (q // i) that are also greater than or equal to x - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, where `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i` where `i` is a divisor) that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If no such divisors exist, the function returns an empty list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Settling Pattern**:
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The first \(k\) positions are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The next \(k - 2\) positions are numbered \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - \(k > 1\)

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine how many natural numbers \(k\) fit the given constraints for a given \(n\) and \(x\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is valid because if \(y\) is odd, there cannot be a valid \(k\) that fits the pattern (since \(2k - 2\) is always even).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid.
   - It also checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and valid.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\).
   - It converts \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Odd \(y\) Check**:
   - This is correct because \(2k - 2\) is always even, and if \(y\) is odd, no \(k\) can satisfy the pattern.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It handles the square root case and ensures that only valid divisors are added to the list \(M\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly calculates the potential \(k\) values by considering the two cases:
     - \(k\) values from \((y - 2) // 2\).
     - \(k\) values from \((n - x) // 2\) if \(n \geq 3x - 2\).
   - It ensures that the results are unique by converting \(L1\) to a set before printing the length.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) correctly.
- The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only adding valid ones.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
