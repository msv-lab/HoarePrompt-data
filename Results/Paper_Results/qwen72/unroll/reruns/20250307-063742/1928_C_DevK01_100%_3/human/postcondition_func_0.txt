The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, where `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i` where `i` is a divisor) that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If no such divisors exist, the function returns an empty list.
