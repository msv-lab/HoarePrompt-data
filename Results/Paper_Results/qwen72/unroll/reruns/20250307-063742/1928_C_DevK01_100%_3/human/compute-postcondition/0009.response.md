The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, with the constraints 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a set `M` which contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (q // i) that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, and returns a set `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (q // i) that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
