Postcondition: **q is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, M is a list. If w is an integer (i.e., w is a perfect square) and w >= x - 1, then M contains the integer value of the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains empty.**
