### Reasoning:

1. **Odd \(y\) Check**:
   - The check `if y % 2 != 0` is correct because \(y = n + x\) must be even for there to be a valid \(k\). This is because the pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions, which is always even. If \(y\) is odd, no \(k\) can satisfy the pattern, and the program correctly prints 0 and continues to the next test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - The initial check `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` ensures that if \(w\) is an integer (i.e., \(q\) is a perfect square) and \(w\) is a valid divisor, it is added to the list \(M\).
   - The loop `while i < w` iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid divisors. It correctly adds these divisors to the list \(M\) if they are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\). This is correct because \((y - 2) // 2\) represents the position in the first part of the pattern.
   - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\). This is correct because \((n - x) // 2\) represents the position in the second part of the pattern.
   - It converts \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set. This ensures that each valid \(k\) is counted only once.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) correctly.
- The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only adding valid ones.

### Verification with Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly calculates the state at key points.
- The function `func_1` is correctly annotated to ensure it finds all valid divisors.
- The main logic is correctly annotated to ensure it handles the two cases and removes duplicates.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
