Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Settling Pattern**:
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The first \(k\) positions are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The next \(k - 2\) positions are numbered \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - \(k > 1\)

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine how many natural numbers \(k\) fit the given constraints for a given \(n\) and \(x\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is valid because if \(y\) is odd, there cannot be a valid \(k\) that fits the pattern (since \(2k - 2\) is always even).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid.
   - It also checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and valid.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\).
   - It converts \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Odd \(y\) Check**:
   - This is correct because \(2k - 2\) is always even, and if \(y\) is odd, no \(k\) can satisfy the pattern.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It handles the square root case and ensures that only valid divisors are added to the list \(M\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly calculates the potential \(k\) values by considering the two cases:
     - \(k\) values from \((y - 2) // 2\).
     - \(k\) values from \((n - x) // 2\) if \(n \geq 3x - 2\).
   - It ensures that the results are unique by converting \(L1\) to a set before printing the length.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) correctly.
- The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only adding valid ones.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
