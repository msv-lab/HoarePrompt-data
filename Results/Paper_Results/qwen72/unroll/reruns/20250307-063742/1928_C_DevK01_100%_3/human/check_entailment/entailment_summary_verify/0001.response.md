### Reasoning:

1. **Odd \(y\) Check**:
   - The program checks if \(y = n + x\) is odd. If it is, the program prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because \(2k - 2\) is always even, and if \(y\) is odd, no \(k\) can satisfy the pattern.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid.
   - It also checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and valid.
   - The function correctly identifies and returns the valid divisors.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\).
   - It converts \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.
   - This logic is correct because it considers the two possible cases for \(k\):
     - \(k\) values from \((y - 2) // 2\).
     - \(k\) values from \((n - x) // 2\) if \(n \geq 3x - 2\).

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) correctly.
   - The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only adding valid ones.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading**:
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

- **Initial Check**:
  - The check for \(y\) being odd is correct and necessary. If \(y\) is odd, there is no valid \(k\) because \(2k - 2\) is always even.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
  - The loop iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid.
  - The square root check ensures that if \(q\) is a perfect square, the square root is included in the list of divisors.
  - The function returns a list of valid divisors, which is correct.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\).
  - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\).
  - The conversion of \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates is correct and necessary to ensure that each \(k\) is counted only once.
  - The program prints the length of the set, which is the number of valid \(k\) values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
