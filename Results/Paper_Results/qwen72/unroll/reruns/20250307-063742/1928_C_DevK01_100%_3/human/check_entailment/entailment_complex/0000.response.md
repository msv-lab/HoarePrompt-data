### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` representing Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - It checks if `y % 2 != 0`. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, there is no valid `k` that can satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Function Call:**
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If this condition is true, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the result to `L1`.

4. **Set Conversion and Output:**
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.
   - The length of `L1` is printed, which represents the number of different `k` that fit the given constraints.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store valid divisors.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the integer value of the square root to `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to `w` (the square root of `q`), checking if `i` is a divisor of `q`.
   - If `i` is a divisor and `i >= x - 1`, it adds `i` to `M`.
   - If `q // i` is a divisor and `q // i >= x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the initial check for `y` being odd.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding complementary divisors.
- The program ensures that the final list `L1` contains unique values by converting it to a set and back to a list.
- The logic for determining the number of valid `k` values is sound and follows the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly identifies and counts the number of valid `k` values for each test case based on the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
