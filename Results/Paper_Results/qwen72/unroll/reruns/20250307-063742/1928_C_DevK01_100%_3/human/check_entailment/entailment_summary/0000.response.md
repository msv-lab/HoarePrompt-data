### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern in which students are numbered in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The pattern is: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, \ldots\).
   - Vasya remembers his position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received. We need to determine how many values of \(k\) fit the given constraints.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), \(k\) must be such that \(n\) falls into the correct segment of the pattern that corresponds to \(x\).
   - The position \(n\) can be expressed in terms of \(k\) and the number \(x\) as follows:
     - If \(n\) is in the first \(k\) positions, \(n\) should be \(x\).
     - If \(n\) is in the next \(k - 2\) positions, \(n\) should be \(2k - 1 - x\).
     - This pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1` with this value and \(x\).
   - It then checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\) and their corresponding complementary divisors.
   - It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{q}\) to find divisors.
   - If a divisor \(i\) is found, it checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It returns a list of these divisors.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The main logic correctly handles the even and odd cases for \(y\).
   - The use of \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) in the calls to `func_1` is appropriate for finding the valid \(k\) values.
   - The combination of results from both calls and the removal of duplicates using a set is correct.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the divisors and their complements that fit the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
