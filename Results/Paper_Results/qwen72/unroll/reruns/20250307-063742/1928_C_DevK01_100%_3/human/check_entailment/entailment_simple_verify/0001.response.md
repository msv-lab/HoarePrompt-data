### Reasoning:

1. **Odd \(y\) Check**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that if \(y = n + x\) is odd, no valid \(k\) can exist because \(2k - 2\) is always even. This check is essential and correctly implemented in the program.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). The function iterates through possible divisors \(i\) and checks if \(i\) and \(q // i\) are valid divisors.
   - The check for the square root of \(q\) being an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\) is also correctly implemented.
   - The function ensures that only valid divisors are added to the list \(M\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \(L1\) by calling `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\). This is correct because \((y - 2) // 2\) represents the position in the first segment of the pattern.
   - If \(n \geq 3x - 2\), it calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\) and adds the results to \(L1\). This is also correct because \((n - x) // 2\) represents the position in the second segment of the pattern.
   - The program converts \(L1\) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set. This ensures that each valid \(k\) is counted only once.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) correctly.
- The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only adding valid ones.

### Annotated Code Verification:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - \(q\) is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and \(x\) is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem constraints.

- **State inside `func_1`**:
  - \(q\) is an integer, \(x\) is an integer, \(M\) is a list.
  - If \(w\) (the square root of \(q\)) is an integer and \(w \geq x - 1\), then \(M\) contains the integer value of the square root of \(q\). Otherwise, \(M\) remains empty.
  - This is correct and ensures that only valid divisors are added.

- **State after the while loop in `func_1`**:
  - \(i = w\), \(M\) contains all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\), and their corresponding complementary divisors (\(q // i\)) that are also greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
  - This is correct and ensures that all valid divisors are found.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \(k\) that fit the given constraints for each test case. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
