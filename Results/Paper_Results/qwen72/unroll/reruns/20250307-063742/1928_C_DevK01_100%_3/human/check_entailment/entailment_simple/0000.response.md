### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned are in a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output is the number of different \( k \) that fit the given constraints for each test case.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if true, calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates \( w = \sqrt{q} \) and checks if \( w \) is an integer and \( w \geq x - 1 \). If true, it adds \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( w - 1 \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \). If true, it adds \( i \) and \( q // i \) to \( M \) if they are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 and continuing to the next test case.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the subsequent calls to `func_1` are logically sound.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of \( q \) and their complementary divisors that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The program combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the correct number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
