You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and graph is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the vertex. vis is a list of integers where vis[i] is 1 if vertex i has been visited, and 0 otherwise.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: - The deque `q` will be empty after the loop finishes, as all elements are popped off and processed.
    #   - The list `vis` will have 1s for all vertices that were visited during the loop.
    #   - The variable `ver` will hold the last vertex that was processed and printed.
    #
    #Given this, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and uses `graph` and `vis` to determine the neighbors of `ver` and whether they have been visited. The function returns information based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
