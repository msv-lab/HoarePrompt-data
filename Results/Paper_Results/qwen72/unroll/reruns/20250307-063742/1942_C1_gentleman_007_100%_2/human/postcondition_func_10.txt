The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns a list containing all prime numbers from 0 to `num` (inclusive). It also maintains two additional lists, `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime`, where `Highest_Prime[i]` is the highest prime factor of `i` and `Lowest_Prime[i]` is the lowest prime factor of `i` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `num`. However, these lists are not returned and are only used internally within the function. The final state of the program includes the returned list of prime numbers, and the internal lists `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` are fully populated but not accessible outside the function.
