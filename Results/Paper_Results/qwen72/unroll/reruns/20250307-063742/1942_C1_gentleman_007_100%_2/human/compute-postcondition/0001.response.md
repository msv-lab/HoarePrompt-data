Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited, and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`.**

The vertex `ver` has been added to the deque `q`, which was initially empty. The states of `ver`, `graph`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
