To determine the correctness of the provided Python program for the given problem, let's analyze the requirements and the functions provided:

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints**:
  - \( n \) (number of sides of the polygon) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
  - \( x \) (number of vertices Bessie has chosen) ranges from 2 to \( \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \).
  - \( y = 0 \) (no additional vertices can be chosen).

### Key Points:
- The problem involves forming triangles using the given vertices.
- The vertices are chosen such that no additional vertices can be added.
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles.

### Provided Functions:
- **func_1()**: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
- **func_2()**: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
- **func_3(n, v)**: Creates a list of length \( n \) with all elements equal to \( v \).
- **func_4(n, m, v)**: Creates a 2D list of dimensions \( n \times m \) with all elements equal to \( v \).
- **func_5(n, m)**: Reads \( m \) pairs of integers and returns an adjacency list.
- **func_6(n, m)**: Reads \( m \) pairs of integers and returns an adjacency matrix.
- **func_7(l)**: Counts the frequency of each element in the list \( l \).
- **func_8(l)**: Computes a prefix sum matrix for the 2D list \( l \).
- **func_9(x)**: Returns 1 if \( x \) is a power of 2, otherwise 0.
- **func_10(l)**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the list \( l \).
- **func_11(num)**: Generates a list of prime numbers up to \( num \) and their lowest and highest prime factors.
- **func_12(num, Prime_array)**: Factorizes \( num \) using the prime array.
- **func_13(n)**: Factorizes \( n \) using trial division.
- **func_14(d)**: Computes a specific sum based on the prime factorization dictionary \( d \).
- **func_15(n, mod)**: Computes the factorial of numbers up to \( n \) modulo \( mod \).
- **func_16(n, mod)**: Computes the derangement of numbers up to \( n \) modulo \( mod \).
- **func_17(p, x)**: Finds the index of \( x \) in the sorted list \( p \).
- **func_18(p, x)**: Finds the largest index in \( p \) such that \( p[mid] \leq x \).
- **func_19(p, x)**: Finds the smallest index in \( p \) such that \( p[mid] \geq x \).
- **func_20(x)**: Computes the integer square root of \( x \).
- **func_21(a, b, mod)**: Computes \( a^b \) modulo \( mod \).
- **func_22(a, b)**: Computes the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings \( a \) and \( b \).
- **func_23(arr)**: Computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the list \( arr \).
- **func_24(ver)**: Performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex \( ver \).
- **func_25(ver)**: Performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex \( ver \).

### Relevance to the Problem:
- The problem requires forming triangles using the given vertices.
- The provided functions do not directly address the problem of forming triangles in a polygon.
- Functions like **func_5**, **func_6**, **func_15**, **func_16**, **func_22**, **func_23**, **func_24**, and **func_25** are not relevant to the problem.
- Functions like **func_1** and **func_2** are used for input reading, which is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problem.

### Solution Approach:
- Given \( y = 0 \), we can only use the vertices Bessie has chosen.
- The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( x - 2 \).

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program does not contain any function that directly computes the number of non-intersecting triangles.
- The provided functions are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the provided vertices and constraints.

Correctness: **False**
