The function `func_5` accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon and `m` is the number of edges (diagonals) to be added, with the constraint 0 <= m <= n. It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists. Each sublist in `l` contains integers that were appended to it during the loop iterations. Specifically, for each pair of integers `x` and `y` returned by `func_1()`, `y` is appended to `l[x]` and `x` is appended to `l[y]`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged after the function execution.
