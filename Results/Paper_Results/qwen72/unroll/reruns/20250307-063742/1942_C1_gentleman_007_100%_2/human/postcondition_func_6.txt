The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a vertex number from 1 to n, and the list contains x distinct integers. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a distinct integer from the list `l`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `l`. The original list `l` remains unchanged.
