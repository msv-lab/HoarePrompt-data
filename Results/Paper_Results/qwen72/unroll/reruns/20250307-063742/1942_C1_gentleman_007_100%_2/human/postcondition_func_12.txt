The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 4 <= n <= 10^9) and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers. After the function concludes, `n` is reduced to its largest prime factor (or 1 if it was a perfect power of a prime), and `d` contains the prime factors of the original `n` and their respective powers. If `n` is greater than 1 after the factorization process, the value of `d[n]` is incremented by 1.
