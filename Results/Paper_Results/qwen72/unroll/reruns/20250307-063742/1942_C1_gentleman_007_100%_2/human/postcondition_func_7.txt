The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of `l`. The value `p[i][j]` contains the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the element at position (i-1,j-1), inclusive. The original list `l` remains unchanged.
