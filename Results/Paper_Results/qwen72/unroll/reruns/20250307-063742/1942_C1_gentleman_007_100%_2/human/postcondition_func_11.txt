The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `num` greater than 1 and a list or dictionary `Prime_array` where each key or index represents an integer and its value is the smallest prime factor of that integer. The function returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the initial `num`, and each value is the count of how many times that prime factor appears in the factorization of `num`. The input `num` is reduced to 1 during the function execution, and the final state of the program is that `d` contains the prime factorization of the initial `num` in the form of a dictionary.
