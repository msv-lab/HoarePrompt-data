Functionality: ** The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It marks each visited vertex in the list `vis` and prints each visited vertex. After the function concludes, the deque `q` is empty, the list `vis` contains 1s for all vertices that were visited, and the variable `ver` holds the last vertex that was processed and printed. The function does not return any value. **
