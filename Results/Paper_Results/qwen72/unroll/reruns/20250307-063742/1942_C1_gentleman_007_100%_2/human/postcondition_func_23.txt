The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the vertex `ver`, marking all reachable vertices as visited in the `vis` list and printing them in the order they are processed. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, the `vis` list has been updated to mark all reachable nodes from the initial `ver` as visited (value 1), and the `graph` remains unchanged. The printed output is a sequence of integers representing the vertices visited.
