### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of sides of the polygon), `x` (number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `y` (which is always 0).
   - It initializes the answer `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the initial number of triangles that can be formed by connecting the chosen vertices.
   - It reads the chosen vertices into a list `arr` and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to check for specific conditions that can form additional triangles:
     - If two consecutive vertices in the sorted list are exactly 2 units apart, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the last vertex in the sorted list is `n - 1` and the first vertex is `1`, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the last vertex in the sorted list is `n` and the first vertex is `2`, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices `y` (which is always 0).
   - **func_2**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the chosen vertices.
   - **func_3**: This function initializes a list of length `n` with the value `v`. It is not used in the given program.
   - **func_4**: This function initializes a 2D list of size `n x m` with the value `v`. It is not used in the given program.
   - **func_5**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_6**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_7**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_8**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_9**: This function is not used in the given program.

   - **func_18**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_19**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_20**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_21**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_22**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_23**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_24**: This function is not used in the given program.
   - **func_25**: This function is not used in the given program.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to count the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - The initial number of triangles is `x - 2`, which is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.
   - The additional conditions checked in the loop are:
     - **Condition 1**: If two consecutive vertices are exactly 2 units apart, it means they can form a triangle with the next vertex in the sequence.
     - **Condition 2**: If the last vertex is `n - 1` and the first vertex is `1`, it means they can form a triangle with the vertex `n`.
     - **Condition 3**: If the last vertex is `n` and the first vertex is `2`, it means they can form a triangle with the vertex `1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
   - The logic for counting the triangles is consistent with the problem description.
   - The conditions checked in the loop are valid and cover all the necessary cases for forming additional triangles.
