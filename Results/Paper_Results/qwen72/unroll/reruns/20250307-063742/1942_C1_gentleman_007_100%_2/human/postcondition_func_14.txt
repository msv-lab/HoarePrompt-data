The function `func_15` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns a list `f` containing the first `n + 1` factorial values, each computed modulo `mod`. After the function concludes, the list `f` will have `n + 1` elements, where each element `f[i]` represents the factorial of `i` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) modulo `mod`.
