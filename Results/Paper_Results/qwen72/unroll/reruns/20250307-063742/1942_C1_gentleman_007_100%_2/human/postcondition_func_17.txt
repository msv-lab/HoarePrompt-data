The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of integers `p` and an integer `x`. If `x` is less than the first element in `p`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the last element in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`, or `n - 1` if all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `x`.
