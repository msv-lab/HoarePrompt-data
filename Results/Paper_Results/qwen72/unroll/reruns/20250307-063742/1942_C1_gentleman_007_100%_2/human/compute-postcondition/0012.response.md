Functionality: ** The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` with `n+1` elements. The first two elements of `dearr` are 1 and 0, respectively. If `mod` is -1, each subsequent element from index 2 to `n` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`. If `mod` is a positive integer, each subsequent element from index 2 to `n` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `mod`. **
