The function `func_16` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. `n` is a positive integer, and `mod` is an integer which can be -1 or a positive integer. The function returns a list `dearr` with `n+1` elements. The first two elements of `dearr` are 0 and 1, respectively. If `mod` is -1, each element from index 2 to `n` in `dearr` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`. If `mod` is a positive integer, each element from index 2 to `n` in `dearr` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` with `n+1` elements. The first two elements of `dearr` are 0 and 1. If `mod` is -1, each subsequent element from index 2 to `n` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`. If `mod` is a positive integer, each subsequent element from index 2 to `n` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`.**
