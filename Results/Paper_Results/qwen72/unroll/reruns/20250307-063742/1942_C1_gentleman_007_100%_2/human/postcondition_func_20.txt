The function `func_21` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns the result of `a` raised to the power of `b`, modulo `mod`. After the function concludes, the value of `ans` is the result of this computation, and the input parameters `a` and `b` are not modified.
