Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not contain any logic that directly solves the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions in the program seem to be a collection of utility functions for various purposes, such as input handling, prime number generation, greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation, and dynamic programming, but none of these functions are used in a way that addresses the specific requirements of the problem.

To solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Parse the input to get the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the vertices themselves.
2. Determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices and possibly additional vertices (though in this version, y = 0, so no additional vertices can be chosen).
3. Output the result for each test case.

The program provided does not perform these steps. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem.
