To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is an integer representing a starting vertex in a graph.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the vertex.
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited.
   - `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop continues as long as the deque `q` is not empty.
   - In each iteration, the leftmost element of `q` is removed and stored in `ver`.
   - The current `ver` is printed.
   - For each neighbor `node` of `ver` in the `graph`, if `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is 0), it is appended to `q` and marked as visited (`vis[node]` is set to 1).

3. **Output State:**
   - The deque `q` will be empty after the loop finishes, as all elements are popped off and processed.
   - The list `vis` will have 1s for all vertices that were visited during the loop.
   - The variable `ver` will hold the last vertex that was processed and printed.

Given this, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `vis` is a list where all visited vertices are marked with 1, and `ver` holds the last visited vertex.**

In natural language, this means:
- The deque `q` will be empty because all elements have been processed.
- The list `vis` will have 1s for all vertices that were visited during the loop, indicating that they have been processed.
- The variable `ver` will contain the last vertex that was processed and printed by the loop.
