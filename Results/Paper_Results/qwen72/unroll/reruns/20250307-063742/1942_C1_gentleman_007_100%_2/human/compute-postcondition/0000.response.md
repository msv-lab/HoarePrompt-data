Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited, and 0 otherwise, `q` is an empty deque.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that a new variable `q` is introduced, which is an empty deque. This deque can be used for operations like adding or removing elements, typically in a breadth-first search (BFS) or similar algorithm.
