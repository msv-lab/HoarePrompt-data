The function `func_19` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of the minimum and maximum values in `p`. It returns the length of the list `p` if `x` is greater than the maximum value in `p`. Otherwise, it returns the smallest index `l` in `p` such that `p[l]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The input list `p` and the integer `x` remain unchanged.
