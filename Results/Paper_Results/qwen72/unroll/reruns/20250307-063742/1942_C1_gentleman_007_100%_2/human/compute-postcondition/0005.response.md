The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function also implicitly uses two other parameters: `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the vertex, and `vis`, which is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited, and 0 otherwise. The function returns information based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given context.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and uses `graph` and `vis` to determine the neighbors of `ver` and whether they have been visited. The function returns information based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
