The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `4 <= n <= 10^9` and `0 <= m <= n`. It returns a 2D list `l` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, where the elements at positions `(x, y)` and `(y, x)` are set to 1 for each `(x, y)` pair returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations. All other elements in `l` remain 0. The input parameters `n` and `m` are not modified.
