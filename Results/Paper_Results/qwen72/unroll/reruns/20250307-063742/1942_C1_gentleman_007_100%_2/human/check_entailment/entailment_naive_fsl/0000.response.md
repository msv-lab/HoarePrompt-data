Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic that directly addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from the vertices of a regular polygon. The functions defined in the program are unrelated to the problem and do not perform the necessary operations to solve it. For example, there is no function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed given a set of vertices, and no function that selects additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
