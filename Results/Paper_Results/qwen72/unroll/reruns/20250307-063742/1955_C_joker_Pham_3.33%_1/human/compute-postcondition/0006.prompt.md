You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:

        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
    #State: The loop modifies the values of `l`, `r`, and `sunks` while `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the final value of `sunks` after the loop has modified the values of `l`, `r`, and `sunks`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the operations performed within the loop, but it is the result of those modifications.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the final value of `sunks` after performing operations within a loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final value of `sunks` after the loop has modified the values of `l`, `r`, and `sunks`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the operations performed within the loop, but it is the result of those modifications.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
