You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns an integer `sunks`, which represents the number of operations performed to reduce the value of `k` by subtracting elements from the list `a` in a specific manner. The function modifies the list `a` and the value of `k` during its execution, but the final state of `a` and `k` is not specified. The primary purpose of the function is to calculate the maximum number of operations that can be performed under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` ships, each with a durability `a_i`.
- The Kraken attacks the ships `k` times in a specific order: first the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on.
- Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
- If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.
- We need to determine how many ships were sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and `a` (list of durabilities).
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, there are several conditions to handle different scenarios:
     - **If `k` is 0:**
       - The loop breaks because no more attacks can be made.
     - **If `l` is equal to `r`:**
       - This means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.
     - **If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`:**
       - The program checks if `k` is sufficient to sink the first ship and reduce the last ship's durability.
       - If `k` is sufficient to sink the first ship and reduce the last ship's durability, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and the pointers `l` and `r`.
       - If `k` is exactly enough to sink the first ship, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
       - If `k` is not enough to sink the first ship, it breaks the loop.
     - **If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`:**
       - The program checks if `k` is sufficient to sink the last ship and reduce the first ship's durability.
       - If `k` is sufficient to sink the last ship and reduce the first ship's durability, it updates `k`, `a[l]`, and the pointers `l` and `r`.
       - If `k` is exactly enough to sink the last ship, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
       - If `k` is not enough to sink the last ship, it breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Pointer Management:**
  - The pointers `l` and `r` are correctly used to track the first and last ships.
- **Durability Reduction:**
  - The program correctly reduces the durability of the ships and checks if they sink.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `l` equals `r` (only one ship left) correctly.
  - The program also handles the case where `k` is 0 (no more attacks) correctly.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships. The logic and conditions are well-structured to ensure that the program works for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
