The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `k` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a_i` has the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns the final value of `sunks`, which is modified based on the operations performed within the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the final value of `sunks` after performing operations within a loop.**
