### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks, meaning no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means only one ship is left. The Kraken attacks this ship, and if the remaining durability is less than or equal to `k`, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, the Kraken attacks the first ship:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, the Kraken can attack the first ship twice (once from the front and once from the back), reducing the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes 0, it sinks, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - The first ship sinks, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the first ship twice, and the first ship sinks, breaking the loop.
     - If `k` is less than `2 * a[l] - 1`, the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the Kraken attacks the last ship:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, the Kraken can attack the last ship twice (once from the back and once from the front), reducing the durability of the first ship by `a[r]`.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it sinks, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - The last ship sinks, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the last ship twice, and the last ship sinks, breaking the loop.
     - If `k` is less than `2 * a[r] - 1`, the loop breaks.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, which is stored in `sunks`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of the program is designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships in the specified order.
- The program correctly handles the case where only one ship is left.
- The program also correctly handles the case where the Kraken can attack a ship multiple times before moving to the next ship.
- The program ensures that the Kraken only attacks ships that have not yet sunk.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Ship**: The program correctly handles the case where there is only one ship.
- **No Attacks**: The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning no attacks are made.
- **All Ships Sink**: The program correctly handles the case where all ships sink before `k` attacks are exhausted.
- **Partial Attacks**: The program correctly handles the case where `k` attacks are not enough to sink all ships.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and the main logic of the Kraken's attacks.

Correctness: **True**
