The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns an integer `sunks`, which represents the number of operations performed to reduce the value of `k` by subtracting elements from the list `a` in a specific manner. The function modifies the list `a` and the value of `k` during its execution, but the final state of `a` and `k` is not specified. The primary purpose of the function is to calculate the maximum number of operations that can be performed under the given constraints.
