### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` is zero, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l]` (durability of the first ship) is less than or equal to `a[r]` (durability of the last ship), the program checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it reduces `k` by `2 * a[l]`, updates the durability of the last ship, and increments the `sunks` counter.
   - If `a[r]` (durability of the last ship) is less than `a[l]` (durability of the first ship), the program checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both the last and first ships. If so, it reduces `k` by `2 * a[r]`, updates the durability of the first ship, and increments the `sunks` counter.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is zero, breaking the loop.
   - It also correctly handles the case where only one ship is left and `k` is sufficient to sink it.
   - The program ensures that the loop breaks if `k` is not sufficient to sink the next ship, preventing unnecessary operations.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of ships that have sunk for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and updates the durabilities and the number of sunk ships accordingly. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic where the program might not correctly handle the case where `k` is exactly equal to the remaining durability of the last ship when `l` and `r` are not equal. This could lead to an incorrect count of sunk ships.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
- The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the remaining attacks when `l` and `r` are not equal and `k` is exactly equal to the remaining durability of the last ship. In such a case, the program should still count the last ship as sunk, but it does not do so correctly.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it correctly handles the case where `k` is exactly equal to the remaining durability of the last ship, even when `l` and `r` are not equal. This can be done by adding an additional check after the main conditions to ensure that the last ship is counted as sunk if `k` is exactly equal to its remaining durability.
