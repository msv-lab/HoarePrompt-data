Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. The function then checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. For `n` greater than 2, it prints 'NO' if the count of '1' in `s` is odd or if the substring '11' appears exactly once; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and any external variables `start` and `end` (if they exist) remain unchanged. **
