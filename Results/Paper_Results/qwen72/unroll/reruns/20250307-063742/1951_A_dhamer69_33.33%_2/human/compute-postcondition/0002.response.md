Output State: **`t` is 0, and the values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0. The variables `start` and `end` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
