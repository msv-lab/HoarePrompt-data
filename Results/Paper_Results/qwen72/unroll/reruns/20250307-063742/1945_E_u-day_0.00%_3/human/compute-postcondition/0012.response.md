The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the variables `pos`, `n`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st`.

Given the initial state:
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `arr` are unchanged.
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
