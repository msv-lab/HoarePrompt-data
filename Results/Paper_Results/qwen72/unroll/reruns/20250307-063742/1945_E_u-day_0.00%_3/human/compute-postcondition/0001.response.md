Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n], and `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`.** 

In natural language: The initial state specified that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n]. After executing the code snippet, `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`, and the values of `n` and `k` remain as they were updated by `func_1()`.
