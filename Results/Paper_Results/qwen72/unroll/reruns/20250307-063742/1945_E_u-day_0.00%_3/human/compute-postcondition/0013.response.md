Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `arr` are unchanged.
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`low`**:
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it must be less than `k`.

2. **`pos`**:
   - `pos` remains unchanged, so its value is the same as it was before the code snippet was executed.

3. **`low + 1`**:
   - Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low + 1` will be the smallest index such that `arr[low + 1]` is greater than `k`.
   - This is because `arr[low]` is less than `k` and `arr[low + 1]` is the next element in the list, which must be greater than `k` (as `low` is the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`).

4. **`pos + 1`**:
   - `pos` is unchanged, so `pos + 1` is simply the value of `pos` incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
The `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement will print the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

- `low + 1` is the smallest index such that `arr[low + 1]` is greater than `k`.
- `pos + 1` is the value of `pos` incremented by 1.

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the smallest index such that arr[low + 1] is greater than k, and pos + 1 is the value of pos incremented by 1)**
