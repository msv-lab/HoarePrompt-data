The function `func_1` reads a line of user input, which is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, and returns a map object that will convert this input into a sequence of integers. The function does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
