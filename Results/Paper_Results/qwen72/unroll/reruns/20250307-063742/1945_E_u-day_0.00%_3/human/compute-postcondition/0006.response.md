Output State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `n` and `arr` are unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`. `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `pos`, `n`, `arr`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the initial state remains the same, with the addition of `st` being an empty set.
