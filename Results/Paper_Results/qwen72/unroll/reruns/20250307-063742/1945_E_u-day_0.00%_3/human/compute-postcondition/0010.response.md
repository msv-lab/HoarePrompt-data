The given `print` statement is:
```
print(0)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `arr` are unchanged.
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
- The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

Output: **0**
