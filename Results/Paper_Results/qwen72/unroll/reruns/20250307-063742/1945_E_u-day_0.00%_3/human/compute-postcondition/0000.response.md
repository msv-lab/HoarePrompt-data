Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n].** 

In natural language, the values of `n` and `k` are now the specific values returned by the function `func_1()`, while the list `arr` remains unchanged, still consisting of unique integers within the range [1, n].
