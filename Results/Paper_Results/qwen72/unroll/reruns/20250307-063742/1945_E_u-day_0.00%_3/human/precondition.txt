The function `solve` is part of a program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes a permutation `p` of size `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ n) to be found in the permutation. The permutation `p` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n. The function is called within a loop that iterates `t` times (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), where `t` is the number of test cases. The sum of the values of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
