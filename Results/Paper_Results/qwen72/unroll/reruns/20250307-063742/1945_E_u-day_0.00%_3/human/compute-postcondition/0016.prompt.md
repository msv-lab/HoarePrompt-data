You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, arr is a list of integers of length n, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n].
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `n` and `arr` are unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the smallest index such that arr[low + 1] is greater than k, and pos + 1 is the value of pos incremented by 1)
    #State: *`pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`, and returns the index of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
