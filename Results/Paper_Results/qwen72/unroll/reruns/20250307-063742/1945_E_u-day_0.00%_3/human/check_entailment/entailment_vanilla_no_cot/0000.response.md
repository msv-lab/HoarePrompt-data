Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only attempts to swap elements once if the binary search fails to find the element at the correct position. However, the problem specifies that up to two swaps can be performed to ensure the binary search algorithm finds the correct element. The program does not account for the possibility of needing a second swap, which is a critical part of the solution. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the element is found at the `high` position after the loop, which is another potential issue. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Determine if the permutation can be made to satisfy the binary search condition with up to two swaps.
3. Perform the necessary swaps and output the correct number of operations and the indices of the swaps.

The current implementation only checks and swaps once, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
