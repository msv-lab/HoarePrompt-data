Output State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `n` and `arr` are unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`.**

The values of `low` and `high` are updated to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The initial state of `pos` remains unchanged, and `n` and `arr` also remain unchanged.
