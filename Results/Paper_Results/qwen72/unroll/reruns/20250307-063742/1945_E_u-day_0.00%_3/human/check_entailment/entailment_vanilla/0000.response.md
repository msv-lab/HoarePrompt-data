### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   - In a sorted array, if `p_m` is less than or equal to `x`, we move the lower bound `l` to `m`.
   - If `p_m` is greater than `x`, we move the upper bound `r` to `m`.
   - The loop ends when `r - l = 1`, and the final position `l` should point to `x`.

3. **Handling the Permutation:**
   - Since the permutation is not sorted, we need to make it "searchable" by performing swaps.
   - The key is to ensure that the element `x` is in a position where the binary search will find it correctly.

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2**: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - **func_3**: 
     - Reads the length `n` and the target `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for binary search.
     - Performs binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is already `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, one swap is performed to move `x` to the position `low`.

5. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `x`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search interval is halved each time until `r - l = 1`.

6. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The swap is performed between `low` and `pos`, which is the correct position of `x` in the permutation.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by outputting `1` and the swap indices.

8. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly. The logic and implementation are sound for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
