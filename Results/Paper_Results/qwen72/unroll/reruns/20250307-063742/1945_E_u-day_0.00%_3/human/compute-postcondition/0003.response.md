The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `i` is not explicitly set before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
