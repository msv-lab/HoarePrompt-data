### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` where `k` is located.
   - This step is correct and ensures that `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop that continues until `low + 1` is equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.
   - This part of the program is a standard binary search, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is not guaranteed to work correctly.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` and the indices `(low + 1, pos + 1)` to indicate a single swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array:**
  - The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted. Applying it to an unsorted permutation can lead to incorrect results.
  - For example, if `k` is not in the correct position, the binary search might not find it, even though it exists in the array.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not ensure that the binary search will find `k` correctly because it is applied to an unsorted permutation.
  - The problem requires that the permutation be rearranged (with at most 2 swaps) to ensure that the binary search will find `k` correctly.
  - The current implementation does not perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation, which means it will not always produce the correct result.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
