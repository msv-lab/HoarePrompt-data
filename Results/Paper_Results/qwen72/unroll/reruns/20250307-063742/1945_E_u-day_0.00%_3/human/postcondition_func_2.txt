The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It uses the values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_1`, and the list `arr` returned by `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the smallest index in `arr` where the value is greater than `k` and the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found). The final state of the program includes `pos` being the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found), `low` being the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` being the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, and `st` containing all the indices that were checked during the binary search loop. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
