#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that will convert user input into a list of integers, where the user input is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of user input, which is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, and returns a map object that will convert this input into a sequence of integers. The function does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, the exact content of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The exact content of the list is unknown because `func_1` is not defined in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, arr is a list of integers of length n, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n].
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()

    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `n` and `arr` are unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n - 1

    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the smallest index such that arr[low + 1] is greater than k, and pos + 1 is the value of pos incremented by 1)
    #State: *`pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It uses the values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_1`, and the list `arr` returned by `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the smallest index in `arr` where the value is greater than `k` and the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found). The final state of the program includes `pos` being the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found), `low` being the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` being the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, and `st` containing all the indices that were checked during the binary search loop. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
