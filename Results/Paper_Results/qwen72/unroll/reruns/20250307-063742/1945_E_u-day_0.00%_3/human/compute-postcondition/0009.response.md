Postcondition: **`pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and the current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.**
