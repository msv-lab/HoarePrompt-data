Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding a number \( x \) in a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) using a binary search algorithm, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the search is successful. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers, returning a map object.
   - It is used to read the values of \( n \) and \( x \) for each test case.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for its intended purpose of reading and splitting input into integers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It is used to read the permutation \( p \).
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for its intended purpose of reading and converting a line of input into a list of integers.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads \( n \) and \( x \) using `func_1` and the permutation \( p \) using `func_2`.
   - It then searches for the index of \( x \) in the permutation \( p \) and stores it in `pos`.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position of \( x \) in the permutation.
   - If \( x \) is found at the position `low`, it prints `0`.
   - If \( x \) is not found at `low`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

However, the program has a few issues:
- **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is not entirely correct. The loop condition should be `low < high` instead of `low + 1 < high` to ensure the search continues until `low` and `high` converge.
- **Swap Logic**: The program only prints a single swap, but the problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed. The current implementation does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to ensure the binary search finds \( x \).

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem's requirements of potentially performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds \( x \).

Correctness: **False**
