### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search after performing at most 2 swaps.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   - In a sorted array, if `p_m` is less than or equal to `x`, we move the lower bound `l` to `m`.
   - If `p_m` is greater than `x`, we move the upper bound `r` to `m`.
   - The loop ends when `r - l = 1`, and the final position `l` should point to `x`.

3. **Handling the Permutation:**
   - Since the permutation is not sorted, we need to make it "searchable" by performing swaps.
   - The key is to ensure that the element `x` is in a position where the binary search will find it correctly.

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
     - This function is correctly used to read the input for `n` and `x`.
   - **func_2**: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
     - This function is correctly used to read the permutation `arr`.
   - **func_3**:
     - Reads the length `n` and the target `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for binary search.
     - Performs binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is already `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, one swap is performed to move `x` to the position `low`.

5. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `x`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search interval is halved each time until `r - l = 1`.

6. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The swap is performed between `low` and `pos`, which is the correct position of `x` in the permutation.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by outputting `1` and the swap indices.

8. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - The program is in an initial state where no variables are defined.
  - `func_1` reads the input and returns a map object of integers.

- **State Before `func_2` Call:**
  - The program has read `n` and `x` from the input.
  - `func_2` reads the permutation `arr` and returns it as a list.

- **State Before Binary Search:**
  - `n` and `x` are correctly read.
  - `arr` is correctly read as a list of integers.
  - `pos` is correctly set to the index of `x` in `arr` if `x` is present; otherwise, it remains `-1`.

- **State During Binary Search:**
  - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `n - 1` respectively.
  - The binary search loop correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `x`.
  - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search interval is halved each time until `r - l = 1`.

- **State After Binary Search:**
  - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, the program correctly outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
  - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, the program correctly outputs `1` and the swap indices `(low + 1, pos + 1)`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly. The logic and implementation are sound for the given problem constraints.
