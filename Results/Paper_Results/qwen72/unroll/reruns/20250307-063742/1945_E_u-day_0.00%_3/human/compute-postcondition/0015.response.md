The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, representing the number to be found.
- `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n].

The function returns the index of the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`, and returns the index of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns -1.**
