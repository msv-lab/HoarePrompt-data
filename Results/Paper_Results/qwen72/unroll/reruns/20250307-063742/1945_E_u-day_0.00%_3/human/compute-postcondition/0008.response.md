Output State: **`pos` remains unchanged, `n` and `arr` are unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`, and `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`pos`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same as its initial value.
- **`n` and `arr`**: These variables are also not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`low`**: After the loop, `low` will be the largest index in `arr` such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is not in `arr`, `low` will be the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than `k`.
- **`high`**: After the loop, `high` will be the smallest index in `arr` such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`. If `k` is not in `arr`, `high` will be the smallest index where `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- **`st`**: This set will contain all the indices that were checked during the loop, specifically the midpoints calculated in each iteration.
