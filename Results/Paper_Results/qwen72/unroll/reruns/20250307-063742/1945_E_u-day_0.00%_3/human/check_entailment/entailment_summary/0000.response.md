Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - `func_2` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is used to get the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - `func_3` iterates through the list `arr` to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The function initializes `low` and `high` to the start and end of the list, respectively.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position where `k` should be if the list were sorted.
   - The loop continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it means `k` is in the correct position, and the function prints `0`.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it means `k` is not in the correct position, and the function prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate the swap needed to place `k` in the correct position.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of swaps needed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is performed to find the correct position where `k` should be if the list were sorted.
   - The function correctly determines if `k` is already in the correct position or if a single swap is needed to place it in the correct position.
   - However, the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The function only considers a single swap, which might not always be sufficient to make the binary search work as intended.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `6 3` with permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `k` is already in the correct position, so the function correctly prints `0`.
   - For the test case `6 5` with permutation `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`, the function correctly identifies that `5` is not in the correct position and prints `1` followed by the indices `3 4` to swap `5` and `4`.
   - For the test case `5 1` with permutation `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`, the function correctly identifies that `1` is not in the correct position and prints `1` followed by the indices `2 4` to swap `1` and `5`.
   - For the test case `6 3` with permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`, the function correctly identifies that `3` is not in the correct position and prints `1` followed by the indices `4 5` to swap `3` and `5`.
   - For the test case `3 2` with permutation `[3, 2, 1]`, the function correctly identifies that `2` is not in the correct position and prints `1` followed by the indices `1 3` to swap `2` and `3`.

However, the function does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed to ensure the binary search works correctly. For example, consider the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` and `k = 2`. The function will only consider one swap, which might not be enough to place `2` in the correct position for the binary search to work.

Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the problem statement, which allows for up to 2 swaps.

Correctness: **False**
