To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Substituting the values of `low` and `high` into the condition, we get:
- `0 + 1 < n - 1`
- `1 < n - 1`
- `2 < n`

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted. The state of `pos`, `arr`, and `st` does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `n` and `arr` are unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2. `st` is an empty set.**
