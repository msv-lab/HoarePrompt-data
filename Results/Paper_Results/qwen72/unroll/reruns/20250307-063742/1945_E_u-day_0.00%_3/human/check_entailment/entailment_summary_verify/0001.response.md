### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search.
   - We are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before the binary search.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - Binary search assumes the array is sorted, but in this case, the permutation is not sorted.
   - The key is to make the permutation "searchable" by performing the allowed swaps.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2**: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - **func_3**:
     - Reads the length `n` and the target `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for binary search.
     - Performs binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is already `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, one swap is performed to move `x` to the position `low`.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `x`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search interval is halved each time until `r - l = 1`.

5. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The swap is performed between `low` and `pos`, which is the correct position of `x` in the permutation.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by outputting `1` and the swap indices.

7. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The original assessment correctly notes that the program handles multiple test cases.
  - However, the program does not explicitly handle multiple test cases. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then loop over each test case.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program only performs one swap, but the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps.
  - The program might not always find the correct position with just one swap, especially in more complex permutations.

### Corrected Program:

To ensure the program handles multiple test cases and performs up to 2 swaps correctly, we need to modify `func_3` to read the number of test cases and loop over each test case. Additionally, we need to ensure that the program can perform up to 2 swaps if necessary.

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x) = func_1()
        arr = func_2()
        pos = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == x:
                pos = i
                break
        (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
        st = set()
        while low + 1 < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            st.add(mid)
            if arr[mid] > x:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid
        if arr[low] == x:
            print(0)
        elif arr[high] == x:
            print(0)
        else:
            # Perform the first swap
            print(1)
            print(low + 1, pos + 1)
            arr[low], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[low]
            # Perform the second swap if necessary
            if arr[high] != x:
                print(1)
                print(high + 1, pos + 1)
                arr[high], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[high]

# Example usage:
func_3()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original program was incorrect because it did not handle multiple test cases and only performed one swap, which might not always be sufficient.
- The corrected program handles multiple test cases and performs up to 2 swaps as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
