Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm might need more than one swap to correctly position the element `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. The program only performs one swap if the element is not found at the correct position after the initial binary search, which does not align with the problem description that allows up to two swaps.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 3
  2 4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  1 2
  ```
In this case, the program only performs one swap, which is insufficient to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. The problem description explicitly states that up to two swaps can be performed, and the program does not utilize this capability correctly.
