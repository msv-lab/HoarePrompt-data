Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is unique and within the range [1, n], and `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is assigned the value -1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` with each integer being unique and within the range [1, n]. After the code execution, `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`. The initial state of `arr` and the values of `n` and `k` remain as they were after `func_1()` and `func_2()` were executed, with the addition of `pos` being -1.
