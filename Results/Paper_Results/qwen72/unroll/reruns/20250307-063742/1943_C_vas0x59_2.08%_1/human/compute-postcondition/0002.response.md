The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and not relevant**
