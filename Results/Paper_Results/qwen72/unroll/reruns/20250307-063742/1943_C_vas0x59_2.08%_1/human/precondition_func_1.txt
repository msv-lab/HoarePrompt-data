The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v. The function constructs a list of lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `u`.
