Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array.**

Explanation: The loop constructs the path from node `b` back to the starting node `0` by repeatedly appending the previous node in the path until it reaches the starting node. The `previous` array is used to trace back the path, and the loop terminates when it reaches a node with no predecessor (i.e., `n == -1`). The resulting `path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes in the path from `b` to `0`, but in reverse order (from `b` to `0`).
