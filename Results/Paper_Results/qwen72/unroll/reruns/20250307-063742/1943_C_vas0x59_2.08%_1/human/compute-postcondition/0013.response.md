Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ci` is assigned the value of the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 using integer division. Since the length of `path_ba` is an odd number, `ci` will be the middle index of the list `path_ba`. The states of `path_ba` and `ops` remain unchanged.
