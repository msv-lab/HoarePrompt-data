Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(0)` function, and `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)` but not used.**

Explanation:
- The `bfs(0)` function is called, which performs a breadth-first search starting from node 0.
- The function returns two values, but only the first value, `d`, is assigned to a variable. The second value is ignored (denoted by `_`).
- `d` is now the distance array, which contains the shortest distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
- The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged, as the code snippet only affects the variables `d` and `_`.
