Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array.
- `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- In both cases, `path_ba` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length is odd, we follow the odd case.
   - If the length is even, we follow the even case.

2. **Odd Length Case**:
   - `ci` is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - The middle element of `path_ba` is `path_ba[ci]`.
   - `ops` is populated with tuples `(path_ba[ci], i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - Each tuple in `ops` is transformed by the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}`.
   - The transformed values are printed, each on a new line.

3. **Even Length Case**:
   - `c2` is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - `c1` is calculated as `c2 - 1`.
   - `ops` is populated with pairs `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.
   - Each tuple in `ops` is transformed by the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}`.
   - The transformed values are printed, each on a new line.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider two examples to illustrate both cases.

#### Example 1: `path_ba` is `[5, 3, 1, 0]` (Even Length)
- Length of `path_ba` is 4.
- `c2` is `4 // 2 = 2`.
- `c1` is `2 - 1 = 1`.
- `ops` will be populated with pairs `(1, i)` and `(2, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `4 - 1` with a step of 2.
  - `i` ranges from 1 to 3 (1, 3).
  - `ops` will be `[(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)]`.
- The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}` will transform each tuple:
  - `(1, 1)` becomes `2 1`.
  - `(2, 1)` becomes `3 1`.
  - `(1, 3)` becomes `2 3`.
  - `(2, 3)` becomes `3 3`.
- The output will be:
  ```
  2 1
  3 1
  2 3
  3 3
  ```

#### Example 2: `path_ba` is `[5, 3, 1]` (Odd Length)
- Length of `path_ba` is 3.
- `ci` is `3 // 2 = 1`.
- The middle element of `path_ba` is `path_ba[1] = 3`.
- `ops` will be populated with tuples `(3, i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 1 inclusive.
  - `i` ranges from 0 to 1 (0, 1).
  - `ops` will be `[(3, 0), (3, 1)]`.
- The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}` will transform each tuple:
  - `(3, 0)` becomes `4 0`.
  - `(3, 1)` becomes `4 1`.
- The output will be:
  ```
  4 0
  4 1
  ```

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the transformed values of the tuples in `ops` as described above.

Output: **The transformed values of the tuples in `ops` where each value is of the form `x[0] + 1 x[1]` and each tuple is printed on a new line.**

- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be the middle element of `path_ba` plus 1, paired with each index from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be `c1 + 1` and `c2 + 1` paired with each index from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.
