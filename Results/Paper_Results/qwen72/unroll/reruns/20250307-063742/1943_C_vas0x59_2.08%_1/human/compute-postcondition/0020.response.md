To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head: `i`, `path_ba`, and the length of `path_ba`.

1. **Initialization of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
2. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
3. **Increment of `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- The length of `path_ba` is even.

Let's break down the conditions:
- Since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1` will also be an integer.
- The loop will execute if `1 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 1.
- Given that `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`, we can substitute `c1` with `len(path_ba) / 2 - 1`.
- Therefore, the condition becomes `1 < len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2 - 1)`.

Simplifying the condition:
- `1 < len(path_ba) - len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`
- `1 < len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`
- `0 < len(path_ba) / 2`
- `0 < len(path_ba)`

Since `len(path_ba)` is even and must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `len(path_ba)` is 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once:
- `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4 (since `c1` must be at least 1, and `1 < len(path_ba) - 1`).

So, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 1.
- `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

State: **`i` is 1, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`**
