Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array. `ops` is an empty list. `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` is `c2 - 1`. The length of `path_ba` is even.**

`c1` is assigned the value of `c2 - 1`. The length of `path_ba` is even, so `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged.
