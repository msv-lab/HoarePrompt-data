Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive. `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each list within `u2vs` is initially empty and corresponds to the vertices of the tree, where the index represents the vertex. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive.
