Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `previous` is the previous array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)` but not used. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
