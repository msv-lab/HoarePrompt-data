You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v. The function constructs a list of lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `u`.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. `path_ba` remains unchanged.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. `path_ba` remains unchanged. `c2` remains half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` remains `c2 - 1`.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array. `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`. In both cases, `path_ba` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, and `n // 4 + 1` if `n` is even, with `n` being the length of `path_ba`)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: The transformed values of the tuples in `ops` where each value is of the form `x[0] + 1 x[1]` and each tuple is printed on a new line.
    return None
    #The program returns None. The list `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions specified in the if-else block, but `path_ba` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, and populates a list `ops` based on the tree structure and specified conditions, but does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None. The list `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions specified in the if-else block, but `path_ba` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
