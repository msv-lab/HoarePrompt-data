The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input to construct a tree. The first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v. The function constructs a list of lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `u`. The function does not return any value; instead, it populates a list `ops` based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions specified in the if-else block, but `path_ba` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function reads input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, and populates a list `ops` based on the tree structure and specified conditions, but does not return any value.**
