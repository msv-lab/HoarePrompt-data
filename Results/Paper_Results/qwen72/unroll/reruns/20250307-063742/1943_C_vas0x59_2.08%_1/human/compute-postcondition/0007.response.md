Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `previous` is the previous array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)` but not used. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.** 

The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment to `b`. The value of `b` is now the same as the value of `a`, as both `a` and `b` are the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
