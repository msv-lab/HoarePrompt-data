Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive. The function `func_2` still reads input from the standard input, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v. The function constructs a list of lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `u`.**
