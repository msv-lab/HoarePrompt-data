Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array. `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`. In both cases, `path_ba` remains unchanged.***
