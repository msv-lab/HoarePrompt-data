Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array.
- `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- In both cases, `path_ba` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `n`.

2. **Odd Length Case**:
   - If `n` is odd, the middle element of `path_ba` is `path_ba[n // 2]`.
   - `ci` is `n // 2`.
   - `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(path_ba[n // 2], i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - The number of such tuples is `ci + 1`, which is `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Even Length Case**:
   - If `n` is even, `c2` is `n // 2`.
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`, which is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `ops` will contain pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.
   - The number of such pairs is `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) // 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(n - (n // 2 - 1) - 1) // 2 + 1 = (n - n // 2 + 1 - 1) // 2 + 1 = (n // 2) // 2 + 1 = n // 4 + 1`.

### Final Output:
- If `path_ba` has an odd length `n`, the length of `ops` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
- If `path_ba` has an even length `n`, the length of `ops` will be `n // 4 + 1`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, and `n // 4 + 1` if `n` is even, with `n` being the length of `path_ba`)**
