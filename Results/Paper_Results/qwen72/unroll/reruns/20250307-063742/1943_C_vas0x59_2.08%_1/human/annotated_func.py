#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(l):
    return max(range(len(l)), key=lambda x: l[x])
    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v. The function constructs a list of lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `u`.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`.

        #State: `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. `path_ba` remains unchanged.

        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):

        #State: `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. `path_ba` remains unchanged. `c2` remains half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` remains `c2 - 1`.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of nodes from `b` to the starting node `0` in reverse order, as determined by the `previous` array. `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is equal to the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`. In both cases, `path_ba` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, and `n // 4 + 1` if `n` is even, with `n` being the length of `path_ba`)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: The transformed values of the tuples in `ops` where each value is of the form `x[0] + 1 x[1]` and each tuple is printed on a new line.
    return None
    #The program returns None. The list `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions specified in the if-else block, but `path_ba` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the longest path in the tree and populates a list `ops` with specific node pairs based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node of the path and the second element is an index ranging from 0 to the middle index. If the path length is even, `ops` contains pairs of nodes around the middle of the path. The function prints the length of `ops` and the transformed node pairs, and returns `None`. The input tree structure remains unchanged.
