The function `func_2` reads input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the longest path in the tree and populates a list `ops` with specific node pairs based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node of the path and the second element is an index ranging from 0 to the middle index. If the path length is even, `ops` contains pairs of nodes around the middle of the path. The function prints the length of `ops` and the transformed node pairs, and returns `None`. The input tree structure remains unchanged.
