Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list will have at least one element, except for the last node which might remain empty if it is not connected to any other node. The total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`.**
