Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or 0 if all elements are equal, and `i` remains the same.**

In natural language: The program calculates the difference between the index `j` and `i`, subtracts 1, and returns the maximum value between 0 and this difference. If all elements in `arr` are equal, `j` is 0, and the program will return 0. If `j` is greater than `i` by at least 2, the program will return `j - i - 1`. Otherwise, it will return 0.
