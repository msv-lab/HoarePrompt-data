Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a value based on the indices of elements that are not equal to their adjacent elements. If all elements in `arr` are equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray of equal elements that is not at the beginning or end of `arr`, or 0 if no such subarray exists. **
