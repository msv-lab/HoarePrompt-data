### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right until it finds the first element that is not equal to its next element.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left until it finds the last element that is not equal to its previous element.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal, it returns the maximum value between 0 and `(j - i - 1)`. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the array can be made equal by either:
     - Assigning all elements from `i+1` to `j-1` the value of the first element, which costs `(j - i - 1)` burles.
     - Or, if `i` and `j` are such that there are no elements between them (i.e., `j - i - 1 <= 0`), the cost is 0.
   - If the first and last elements are not equal, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`. This is because:
     - Assigning all elements from `i` to the end of the array the value of the first element costs `(n - i - 1)` burles.
     - Assigning all elements from the start of the array to `j` the value of the last element costs `j` burles.
     - The minimum of these two costs is taken to ensure the least amount of burles is spent.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already equal (all elements are the same), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns 1, as it will cost 1 burle to make them equal.
   - If the array has more than two elements and the first and last elements are different, the function correctly returns the minimum cost to make the array equal by either:
     - Assigning the value of the first element to all elements from `i` to the end.
     - Assigning the value of the last element to all elements from the start to `j`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The edge cases and the main logic are handled appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
