Output State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `j` remains `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` at 0 and increments `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. This continues until either `i` reaches the second-to-last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`) or an element is found that is not equal to its next element. If all elements in the array are equal, `i` will eventually reach `len(arr) - 1`. The variable `j` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n - 1`.
