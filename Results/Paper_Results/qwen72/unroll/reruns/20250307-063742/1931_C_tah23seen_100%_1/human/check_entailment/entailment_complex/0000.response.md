### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its next element. This effectively finds the start of the first non-uniform segment from the left.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds the last element that is not equal to its previous element. This effectively finds the start of the first non-uniform segment from the right.
   - If `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`, it means the array is already uniform or can be made uniform by changing the middle segment. The function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed.
   - If `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is the minimum of the lengths of the segments that need to be changed to make the array uniform.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` and `j` will be `0`. The function will return `0`, which is correct.
   - If the array is not uniform, the function will correctly identify the segments that need to be changed and return the minimum cost.

4. **Complexity:**
   - The function runs in linear time, O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
