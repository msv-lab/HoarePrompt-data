Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The optimal solution would be to select the value `2` and set the elements from index `1` to `3` to `2`, which would cost `3` burles. However, the given program will return `2` because it only considers the cost of making the array uniform by extending the segments at the beginning or the end, and does not check if there is a better solution by selecting a different value in the middle of the array.
