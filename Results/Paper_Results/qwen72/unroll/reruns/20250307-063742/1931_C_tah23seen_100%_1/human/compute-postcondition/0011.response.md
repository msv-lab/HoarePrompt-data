The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and the length of `arr`.

Case_1: If there is at least one element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the index of the last such element, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr`.

Case_2: If all elements in `arr` are equal, the function returns 0. If there is at least one element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, the function returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `j` is the index of the last such element, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a value based on the indices of elements that are not equal to their previous elements. If all elements are equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1) in Case_1, or the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j` in Case_2, where `j` is the index of the last element not equal to its previous element, `i` is the index of the first element, and `n` is the length of `arr`.**
