Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of an array equal by applying a specific operation at most once. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself.
3. Calling `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It moves the `i` pointer to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element.
3. It moves the `j` pointer to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element.
4. If the first and last elements of the array are equal, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the boundaries), or 0 if `i` and `j` are adjacent or the same.
5. If the first and last elements are not equal, it returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the function. The function does not correctly handle the case where the array can be made equal by setting a subarray to a value that is not the first or last element of the array. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility of setting a subarray to a value that is the most frequent element in the array, which could potentially result in a lower cost.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function will return 4, which is correct because the minimum cost is to set the subarray from index 1 to 4 to the value 1. However, for the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 1]`, the function will return 2, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1, because setting the subarray from index 1 to 3 to the value 2 would make all elements equal at the minimum cost.

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not always return the correct minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
