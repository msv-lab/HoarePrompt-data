You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a value based on the indices of elements that are not equal to their adjacent elements. If all elements in `arr` are equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray of equal elements that is not at the beginning or end of `arr`, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The optimal solution would be to select the value `2` and set the elements from index `1` to `3` to `2`, which would cost `3` burles. However, the given program will return `2` because it only considers the cost of making the array uniform by extending the segments at the beginning or the end, and does not check if there is a better solution by selecting a different value in the middle of the array.
