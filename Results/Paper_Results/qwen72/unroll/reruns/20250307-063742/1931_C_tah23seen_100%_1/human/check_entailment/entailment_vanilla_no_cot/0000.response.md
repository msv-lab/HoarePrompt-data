Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The issue lies in the logic of the function `func_1`, which does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing the most frequent element in the array and then applying the operation to the minimum number of elements necessary to make the entire array uniform.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), returning 0 burles. However, it fails to handle other cases correctly.

2. **Logic for Non-Uniform Arrays**: The solution attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same and then calculates the minimum cost based on these segments. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal to the most frequent element in the array, which could potentially be a cheaper operation.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, you should:
   - Determine the most frequent element in the array.
   - Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element by applying the operation to the fewest number of elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_element, most_common_count = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
    min_cost = n - most_common_count
    
    return min_cost
```

This corrected version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array. It then finds the most frequent element and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this element by subtracting the count of the most frequent element from the total number of elements. This ensures that the solution is correct for all test cases.
