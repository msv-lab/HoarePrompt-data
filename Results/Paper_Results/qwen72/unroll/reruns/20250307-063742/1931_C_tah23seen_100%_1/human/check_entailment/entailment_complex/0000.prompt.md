Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `j` remains `n - 1`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `i` remains the same, `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or `0` if all elements are equal.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or 0 if all elements are equal, and `i` remains the same.
    #State: *`i` remains the same, `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or `0` if all elements are equal. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or `0` if all elements are equal, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a value based on the indices of elements that are not equal to their adjacent elements. If all elements in `arr` are equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray of equal elements that is not at the beginning or end of `arr`, or 0 if no such subarray exists.
