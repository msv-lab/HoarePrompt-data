To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is `n` (since `n` is equal to the length of `arr`).
   - Therefore, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`.
   - For this condition to be true, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` simplifies to `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - For this condition to be true, the first two elements of `arr` must be equal.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if both conditions are true.
- The first condition (`0 < n - 1`) requires `n` to be greater than 1.
- The second condition (`arr[0] == arr[1]`) requires the first two elements of `arr` to be equal.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The first two elements of `arr` must be equal.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is 0. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1. `j` is equal to `n` - 1. The first two elements of `arr` must be equal.**
