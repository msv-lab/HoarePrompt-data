Output State: **`i` remains the same, `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or `0` if all elements are equal.**

Explanation: The loop decrements `j` until it finds an element in `arr` that is not equal to its previous element, or until `j` reaches `0`. The value of `i` is not affected by the loop.
