Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We have an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers.
- We can apply an operation to select three integers \( i \), \( j \), and \( x \) (where \( 1 \le i \le j \le n \)) and assign all elements of the array with indices from \( i \) to \( j \) the value \( x \). The cost of this operation is \( (j - i + 1) \) burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array elements.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers, \( i \) and \( j \), to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It increments \( i \) while the elements at \( i \) and \( i+1 \) are the same.
   - It decrements \( j \) while the elements at \( j \) and \( j-1 \) are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of \( j - i - 1 \) and 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of \( \min(n - i - 1, j) \) and 0.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal.**
   - If all elements are the same, the function should return 0.
   - The function correctly handles this case by checking if \( \text{arr}[0] == \text{arr}[-1] \) and returning 0 if true.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements at the start and end by moving the pointers \( i \) and \( j \).
   - If the first and last elements are the same after moving the pointers, it returns the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed, which is \( j - i - 1 \).

3. **Case 3: The array has different elements at the start and end.**
   - The function returns the minimum of the lengths of the segments from \( i \) to the end and from the start to \( j \).
   - This ensures that the minimum cost to make all elements equal is calculated correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If \( n = 1 \), the function correctly returns 0 because the array is already equal.
- **Two Element Array:**
  - If \( n = 2 \), the function correctly returns 1 if the elements are different, and 0 if they are the same.
- **Array with All Different Elements:**
  - The function correctly returns \( n - 1 \) because the entire array needs to be changed except for one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and edge cases as described in the problem. It efficiently finds the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
