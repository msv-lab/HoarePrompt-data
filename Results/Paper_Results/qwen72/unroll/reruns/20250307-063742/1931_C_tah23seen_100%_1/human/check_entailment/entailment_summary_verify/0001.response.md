### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func_1` and the program to ensure they meet the requirements of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is set to 0, the start of the array.
   - `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, the end of the array.
   - `n` is set to `len(arr)`, the length of the array.

2. **Finding the Start and End of Contiguous Segments:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as the elements at `i` and `i + 1` are the same. This effectively finds the end of the longest contiguous segment of equal elements starting from the beginning of the array.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as the elements at `j` and `j - 1` are the same. This effectively finds the start of the longest contiguous segment of equal elements from the end of the array.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: All elements are the same.**
     - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the entire array is already equal, and the function returns 0.
   - **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
     - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]` after moving the pointers, it means the remaining segment between `i` and `j` needs to be changed. The function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of this segment.
   - **Case 3: The array has different elements at the start and end.**
     - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This ensures that the minimum cost to make all elements equal is calculated correctly by considering the smaller of the two segments: from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

#### Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr` for each test case.

### Evaluation:
- **Case 1: All elements are the same.**
  - The function correctly returns 0, which is the correct cost since no operation is needed.

- **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
  - The function correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements and returns the length of the segment that needs to be changed. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, `i` will be 1 and `j` will be 3, and the function will return 2 (the length of the segment `[2, 2, 2]`).

- **Case 3: The array has different elements at the start and end.**
  - The function correctly returns the minimum cost to make all elements equal by considering the smaller of the two segments. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, `i` will be 0 and `j` will be 5, and the function will return 4 (the length of the segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]`).

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - The function correctly returns 0 because the array is already equal.
- **Two Element Array:**
  - The function correctly returns 1 if the elements are different, and 0 if they are the same.
- **Array with All Different Elements:**
  - The function correctly returns `n - 1` because the entire array needs to be changed except for one element.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` and the program correctly handle all the cases and edge cases as described in the problem. They efficiently find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
