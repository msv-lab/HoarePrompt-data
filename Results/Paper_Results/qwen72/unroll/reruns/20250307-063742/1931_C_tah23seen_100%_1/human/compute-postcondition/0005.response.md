To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]`.
2. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `j > 0`: This condition ensures that `j` is not 0, meaning there is at least one element before the current `j` in the array.
   - `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`: This condition checks if the current element at index `j` is equal to the previous element at index `j - 1`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `j` remains `n - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j > 0`**: For the loop to execute, `j` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is `n - 1`, this means `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**: For the loop to execute, the element at index `j` must be equal to the element at index `j - 1`. Given that `j` is `n - 1`, this means `arr[n - 1]` must be equal to `arr[n - 2]`.

### Conclusion:
- `j` must be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`, which implies `arr[n - 1]` must be equal to `arr[n - 2]`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, `j` remains `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 1, and `arr[n - 1]` must be equal to `arr[n - 2]`**
