You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
   - The number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
     - The durability of each ship `a`.

2. **Output**: 
   - For each test case, the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks.

3. **Attack Pattern**:
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the list of ships.
   - The Kraken continues attacking until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the first and last indices of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it means the Kraken can fully attack both ships without running out of attacks:
     - It reduces the durability of both ships by `mi`.
     - It reduces `k` by `2 * mi`.
     - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it increments `ans` and adjusts the indices `l` and `r` accordingly.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, it means the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships:
     - It calculates the remaining attacks `t` (which is `k % 2`).
     - It reduces the first ship's durability by `t` and the last ship's durability by `k // 2`.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it increments `ans`.
     - The loop breaks because the Kraken's remaining attacks are not enough to fully attack both ships.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - It checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship and increments `ans` if so.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Correctness Verification
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Attack Logic**:
  - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
  - It correctly handles the case where the Kraken can fully attack both ships.
  - It correctly handles the case where the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships.
  - The final check for a single remaining ship is also correct.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^{15}\)).
  - It correctly handles the case where all ships have the same durability.
  - It correctly handles the case where `k` is small and only a few ships are attacked.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It handles all the edge cases and follows the attack pattern as specified.

Correctness: **True**
