You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a long integer `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then performs operations to reduce the elements of `a` to zero by subtracting the minimum of the elements at the current left and right indices, up to a maximum of `k` total subtractions. The function prints the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to zero after these operations for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further state changes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the Kraken attacks a ship that has already sunk. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**:
   - The `else` block in the `while` loop is intended to handle the case where `k` is not enough to sink both the first and last ships. However, it incorrectly calculates the remaining attacks and updates the durabilities.
   - The line `t = k % 2` and the subsequent check `if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` are not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The program should simply distribute the remaining attacks between the first and last ships until `k` is exhausted or one of the ships sinks.

2. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4 5
     1 2 4 3
     ```
   - The expected output is `2` (as described in the problem statement).
   - The program's output is also `2`, but this is coincidental and does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program should continue to attack the first and last ships in an alternating manner until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.
   - The current logic in the `else` block can lead to incorrect results when `k` is not enough to sink both the first and last ships in a single iteration.

To correct the program, the `else` block should be simplified to handle the remaining attacks more accurately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    while T:
        T -= 1
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        ans = 0
        while l <= r and k > 0:
            if l == r:
                ans += k >= a[l]
                break
            if a[l] <= k:
                k -= a[l]
                a[l] = 0
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] <= k:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in an alternating manner and correctly handles the case where the Kraken attacks a ship that has already sunk.
