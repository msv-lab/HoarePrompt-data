The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is an input integer and `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
