Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node by an edge. `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one neighbor in the `tree`. `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves`. `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
