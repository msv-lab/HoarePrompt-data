#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: tree is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node by an edge. The lists contain the neighbors of each node, and the order of the neighbors is based on the order in which the edges were processed. The variables n, edges, and start remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is odd, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The input variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` will be empty, `visited` will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start` and the loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, the loop will not return a distance and the `queue` will be empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the shortest distance as an integer. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns `-1`. The function modifies a set `visited` to keep track of the nodes it has explored, but does not modify the input tree.
