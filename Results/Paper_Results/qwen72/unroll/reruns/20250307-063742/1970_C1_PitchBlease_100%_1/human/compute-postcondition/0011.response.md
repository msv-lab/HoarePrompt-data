Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is odd, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The input variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. **
