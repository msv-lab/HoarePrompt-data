Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves. According to the problem description, if the starting node is a leaf, the player who starts (Ron) will always lose because there are no inactive neighbors to move the stone to. However, the current implementation of the program will still calculate the distance from the starting node to the other leaf and determine the winner based on the parity of that distance, which is incorrect.

Example:
Input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
Expected Output:
```
Hermione
```
Actual Output:
```
Ron
```
This is because the program will calculate the distance from node 1 to node 3, which is 2 (even), and incorrectly return "Ron" as the winner. The correct behavior should be to return "Hermione" since Ron cannot make a move from node 1.
