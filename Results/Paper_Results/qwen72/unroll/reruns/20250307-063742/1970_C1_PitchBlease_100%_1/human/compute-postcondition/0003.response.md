Output State: **The `queue` will be empty, `visited` will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start` and the loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, the loop will not return a distance and the `queue` will be empty.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `queue` will be empty because all nodes that can be visited from `start` will have been processed.
- The `visited` set will contain all the nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, starting from the `start` node.
- If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the loop will return the shortest distance (number of edges) between `start` and `target`.
- If the `target` node is not reachable, the loop will not return a distance, and the `queue` will be empty after all possible nodes have been processed.
