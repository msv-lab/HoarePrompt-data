Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.** 

The `visited` set has been updated to include the integer `start`, indicating that the `start` node has been visited. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
