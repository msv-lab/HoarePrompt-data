The loop condition is `while queue:`, which means the loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. In the provided state, `queue` is initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since the `queue` is not empty, the loop condition is already satisfied, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
