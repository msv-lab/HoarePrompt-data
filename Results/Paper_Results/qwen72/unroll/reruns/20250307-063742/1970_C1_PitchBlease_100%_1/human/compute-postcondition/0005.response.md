The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in a tree, where `1 <= start, target <= n`. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. The function returns `-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing nodes in a tree. It returns `-1` if the target node is not reachable from the start node.**
