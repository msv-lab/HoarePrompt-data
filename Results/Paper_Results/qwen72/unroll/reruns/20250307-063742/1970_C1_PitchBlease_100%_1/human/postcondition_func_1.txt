The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the shortest distance as an integer. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns `-1`. The function modifies a set `visited` to keep track of the nodes it has explored, but does not modify the input tree.
