Postcondition: ***The `tree` list contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, with `e` appended to the end. `prev` is the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and `start` is an input integer. `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the program follows the else part.***
