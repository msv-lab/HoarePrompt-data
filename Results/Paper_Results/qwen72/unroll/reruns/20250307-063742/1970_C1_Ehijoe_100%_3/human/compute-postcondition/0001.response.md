Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `edges` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from the initial state, where `n` is within the specified range and `t` is 1.
