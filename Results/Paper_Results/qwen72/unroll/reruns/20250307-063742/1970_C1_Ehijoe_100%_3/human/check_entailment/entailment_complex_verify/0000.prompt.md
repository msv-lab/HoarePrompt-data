You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree; and the last line containing one integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *The `tree` list contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, with `e` appended to the end. `prev` is the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and `start` is an input integer. `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the program follows the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, including the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. It constructs a tree representation from the edges and identifies the two leaf nodes. The function then determines the path from one leaf node to the other and checks if the starting node `u_1` is at an odd or even position along this path. If the starting node is at an odd position or the number of moves to either leaf node is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves correctly. According to the problem description, the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. If the stone starts on one of these leaves, the player making the first move (Ron) will have no valid move and will lose. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly determine the winner based on the number of moves from the starting node to the other end of the tree.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
In this case, the tree has nodes 1, 2, and 3, with edges (2, 3) and (3, 1). The leaves are nodes 1 and 2. If the stone starts on node 1, Ron will have no valid move and will lose, but the program will incorrectly print "Ron" because it does not handle the case where the starting node is a leaf.
