Output State: **The `tree` list now contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, with `e` appended to the end. `prev` is still the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
