The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree; and the last line containing one integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
