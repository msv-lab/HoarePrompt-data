The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains one integer `u_1`, where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

The function returns the result of the round based on the starting node `u_1` and the structure of the tree.

Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, including the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. It returns the result of the round based on the starting node and the tree structure.**
