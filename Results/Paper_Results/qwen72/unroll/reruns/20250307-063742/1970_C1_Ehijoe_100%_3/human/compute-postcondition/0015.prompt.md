Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it, `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one direct connection, `s` is the first node in `ends`, `e` is the second node in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first node in `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first node in `ends` (`s`), `curr` is the first node directly connected to `s`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
