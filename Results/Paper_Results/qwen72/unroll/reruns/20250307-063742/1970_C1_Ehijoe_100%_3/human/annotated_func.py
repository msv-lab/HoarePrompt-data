#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree; and the last line containing one integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, and `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it.
    ends = []
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            ends.append(key)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it, `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one direct connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1).
    s, e = list(ends)
    tree = [s]
    prev = s
    curr = nodes[s][0]
    while curr != e:
        tree.append(curr)
        
        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][1]
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][0]
        
    #State: The `tree` list contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, `prev` is the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
    tree.append(e)
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *The `tree` list contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, with `e` appended to the end. `prev` is the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and `start` is an input integer. `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the program follows the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, including the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. It constructs a tree representation from the edges and identifies the two leaf nodes. The function then determines the path from one leaf node to the other and checks if the starting node `u_1` is at an odd or even position along this path. If the starting node is at an odd position or the number of moves to either leaf node is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
