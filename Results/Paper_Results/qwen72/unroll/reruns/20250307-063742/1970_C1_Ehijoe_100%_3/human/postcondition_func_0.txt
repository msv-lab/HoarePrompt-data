The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, including the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. It constructs a tree representation from the edges and identifies the two leaf nodes. The function then determines the path from one leaf node to the other and checks if the starting node `u_1` is at an odd or even position along this path. If the starting node is at an odd position or the number of moves to either leaf node is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
