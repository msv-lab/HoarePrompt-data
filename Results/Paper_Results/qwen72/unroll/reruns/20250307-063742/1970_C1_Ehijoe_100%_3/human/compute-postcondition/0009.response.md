Output State: `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it, `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one direct connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1).
