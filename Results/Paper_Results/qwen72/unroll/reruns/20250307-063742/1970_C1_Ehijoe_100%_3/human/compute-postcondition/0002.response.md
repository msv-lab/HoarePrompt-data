Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is now set to `True`, while the values of `n` and `t` remain as initially assigned from the input, and `edges` remains an empty list.
