The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of `range()` in Python.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `t` are assigned values from the first line of input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `nodes` is an empty defaultdict of lists.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must start at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is an empty defaultdict of lists**
