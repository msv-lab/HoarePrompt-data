Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is an empty defaultdict of lists.**

The initial values of `n` and `t` remain the same, `edges` remains an empty list, and `empty` remains True. The new variable `nodes` is now an empty defaultdict of lists, meaning it will automatically create an empty list for any key that is accessed for the first time.
