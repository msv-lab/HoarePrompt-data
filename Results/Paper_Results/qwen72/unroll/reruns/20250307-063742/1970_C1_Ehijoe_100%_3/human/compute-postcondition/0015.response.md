Output State: **The `tree` list contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited, `prev` is the last node in the `tree` list (which is `e`), `curr` is the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`tree`**: Initially, `tree` contains only the first node in `ends` (`s`). As the loop iterates, it appends each visited node to `tree` until it reaches `e`. Therefore, `tree` will contain all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited.
- **`prev`**: At the end of the loop, `prev` will be the last node added to `tree`, which is `e`.
- **`curr`**: After the loop, `curr` will be the node directly connected to `e` but not `prev`. Since the loop stops when `curr` equals `e`, the next node in the sequence (if any) will be the value of `curr`.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `ends`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
