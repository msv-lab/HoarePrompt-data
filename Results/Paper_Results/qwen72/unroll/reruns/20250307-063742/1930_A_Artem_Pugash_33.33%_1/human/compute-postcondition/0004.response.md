Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `numCases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `numInteger` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then sorts the list in ascending order, pairs the integers, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `numCases` is the number of test cases processed, and the sums of the minimum values of each pair for each test case have been printed. **
