You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `numCases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `numInteger` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then sorts the list in ascending order, pairs the integers, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `numCases` is the number of test cases processed, and the sums of the minimum values of each pair for each test case have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description:
- We have 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing them.
- The goal is to maximize the final score.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `numInteger` and the list of integers `numbers`.

2. **Sorting the Numbers:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.
   - Sorting the numbers in ascending order is a good strategy because it ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first, which maximizes the number of times the smallest number is added to the score.

3. **Performing the Moves:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to 0 to keep track of the score.
   - It enters a while loop that continues until the list `numbers` is empty.
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - It pops the first two elements from the list `numbers` (which are the smallest two elements due to sorting).
     - It converts these elements to integers and adds the minimum of the two to `suma`.
   - This process continues until all elements are removed from the list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all moves for a test case, it prints the final score `suma`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of integers for each test case.
  - It reads the list of integers and splits them into a list.

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the list in ascending order is correct and optimal for this problem. By pairing the smallest numbers first, we ensure that the minimum values are added to the score as many times as possible.

- **Loop and Pairing:**
  - The while loop correctly processes the list until it is empty.
  - Popping the first two elements and adding the minimum of the two to the score is the correct approach.
  - The loop ensures that exactly n moves are performed, as each move removes two elements from the list.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the final score for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case:**
  - The program handles a single test case correctly.
- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a for loop.
- **Small and Large n:**
  - The program works for small values of n (e.g., n=1) and larger values of n (e.g., n=50) as long as the input constraints are met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers and adding the minimum of the two to the score. It handles all input constraints and edge cases appropriately.
