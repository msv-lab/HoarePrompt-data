Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it processes the input and sorts the list. Specifically, the list `numbers` is a list of strings after `input().split()`, and sorting this list as strings will not yield the correct numerical order. For example, the list `['10', '2', '3']` will be sorted as `['10', '2', '3']` instead of `['2', '3', '10']` when sorted numerically.

To fix this, the list should be converted to integers before sorting. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Convert to integers
        numbers.sort()  # Sort numerically
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.
