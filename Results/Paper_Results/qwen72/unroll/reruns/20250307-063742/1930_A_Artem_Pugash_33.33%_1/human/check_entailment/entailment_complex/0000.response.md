### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`).

2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because, to maximize the score, we want to pair the smallest possible numbers together. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest numbers are always paired first, which guarantees that we are always adding the smallest number in each pair to the score.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The function then iterates through the sorted list, popping the first two elements (which are the smallest in the current list) and adding the minimum of these two elements to the score (`suma`). This is done in a loop until the list is empty.

4. **Output**: The function prints the final score for each test case, which is the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers are the same, the score will be the sum of the smallest number repeated `n` times, which is the correct behavior.

6. **Efficiency**: The function is efficient for the given constraints. Sorting the list of `2n` integers takes \(O(2n \log 2n)\) time, and the subsequent loop takes \(O(n)\) time. Since \(n\) is at most 50, the function will run within a reasonable time for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct maximum score for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
