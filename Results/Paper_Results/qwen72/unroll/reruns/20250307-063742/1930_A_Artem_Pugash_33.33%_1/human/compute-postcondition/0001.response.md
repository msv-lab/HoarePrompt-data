The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numCases`. If `numCases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
