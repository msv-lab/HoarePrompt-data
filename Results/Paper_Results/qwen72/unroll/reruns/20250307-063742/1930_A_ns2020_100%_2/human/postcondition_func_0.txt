The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function sorts the list of integers and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the input parameters remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the list `A` and the variable `n` are not preserved between iterations, so their final values are undefined.
