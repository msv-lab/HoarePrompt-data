The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The list `cases` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The exact nature of the results is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
