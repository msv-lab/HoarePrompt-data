The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the variable `t` the value of an integer input provided by the user. The other parts of the initial state, specifically the list of lists containing 2n integers for each test case, remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case. The variable `t` is now an input integer.**
