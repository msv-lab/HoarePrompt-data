Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Summing Minimum Values**: The program sums every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list `A`. This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be the smaller of the two consecutive elements.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable for that test case.

The logic of the program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always selecting the smaller of the two numbers in each pair. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.
