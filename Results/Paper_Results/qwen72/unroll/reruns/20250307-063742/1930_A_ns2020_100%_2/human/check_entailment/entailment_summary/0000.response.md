### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers from a list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both integers. This process is repeated `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers on the whiteboard.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible score after `n` moves.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program sorts the list of integers and then sums the elements at even indices (i.e., every second element starting from the first).
   - The key insight here is that by sorting the list, the smallest `n` elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) in a zero-indexed list. This is because the smallest elements will be paired with the next smallest elements, and the minimum of each pair will be the smaller element, which is always one of the first `n` elements in the sorted list.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first.
   - By summing the elements at even indices, we are effectively summing the smallest `n` elements, which is the optimal way to maximize the score since the minimum of each pair will always be one of these smallest elements.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case individually.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible test case (n=1) correctly.
   - It also handles larger test cases (up to n=50) by sorting the list and summing the appropriate elements.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input in the correct format and processes it as described in the problem statement.
   - The output is the sum of the elements at even indices, which is the correct maximum score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for maximizing the score in the given game.

Correctness: **True**
