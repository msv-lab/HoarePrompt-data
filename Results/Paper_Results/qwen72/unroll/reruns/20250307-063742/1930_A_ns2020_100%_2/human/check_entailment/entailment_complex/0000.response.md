Reasoning:  
The program processes multiple test cases, each with a list of 2n integers. The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly choosing two integers and adding the minimum of the two to the score. The program sorts the list of integers and then sums the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which effectively adds the smaller of each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list.

This approach is correct because:
1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together. This is optimal because the smallest elements will contribute the least to the score when taken as the minimum of a pair.
2. **Summing Even Indices**: After sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller elements of each pair. By summing these elements, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible score.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of 2n integers. It then sorts the list and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. This matches the problem description and the expected output.

Additionally, the program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement, and it processes each test case independently.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
