### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is crucial for maximizing the score.

3. **Summing Elements**:
   - The function then prints the sum of the elements at even indices (`A[::2]`). This is because, in a sorted list, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be the smaller elements in each pair when the list is divided into pairs of two.
   - By summing these elements, the function effectively adds the minimum of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop decrements `t` by 1 after processing each test case and continues until `t` reaches 0, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

5. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the maximum possible score, which is correctly calculated by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases, sorts the list of integers, and calculates the maximum score by summing the minimum elements of each pair. The final state of the program is as expected, with all test cases processed and the correct scores printed.

### Correctness:
**True**
