Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the parameters as described. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def max_score(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.**
