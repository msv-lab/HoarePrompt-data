The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000. Since `t` is already within a range that ensures it is non-zero, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000)**
