You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `t` is now 0. The list `A` and the variable `n` are not preserved between iterations, so their final values are undefined. The initial state of the input parameters remains unchanged, but the loop has processed each test case by sorting the list of integers and printing the sum of the elements at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function sorts the list of integers and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the input parameters remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the list `A` and the variable `n` are not preserved between iterations, so their final values are undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves on a list of `2n` positive integers.
   - In each move, you choose two integers `x` and `y`, add the minimum of the two to your score, and then remove both integers from the list.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible score after `n` moves.

2. **Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, you should always choose the smallest available integers to add to your score. This is because the minimum of two numbers is always the smaller one, and by choosing the smallest numbers first, you ensure that the larger numbers are used in subsequent moves, which will still contribute to the score.
   - Sorting the list of integers in ascending order ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first.
   - After sorting, the smallest `n` numbers will be the ones at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) when the list is zero-indexed. This is because the smallest number will be at index 0, the next smallest at index 1, and so on. When you take every second number starting from index 0, you get the smallest `n` numbers.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It then sums the integers at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) and prints the result.
   - This approach ensures that the smallest `n` numbers are added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The program will work for all valid inputs as described in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.
