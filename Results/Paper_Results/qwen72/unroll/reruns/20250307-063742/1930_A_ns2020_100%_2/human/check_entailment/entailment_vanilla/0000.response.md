### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves on a list of `2n` positive integers.
   - In each move, you choose two integers `x` and `y`, add the minimum of the two to your score, and then remove both integers from the list.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible score after `n` moves.

2. **Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, you should always choose the smallest available integers to add to your score. This is because the minimum of two numbers is always the smaller one, and by choosing the smallest numbers first, you ensure that the larger numbers are used in subsequent moves, which will still contribute to the score.
   - Sorting the list of integers in ascending order ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first.
   - After sorting, the smallest `n` numbers will be the ones at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) when the list is zero-indexed. This is because the smallest number will be at index 0, the next smallest at index 1, and so on. When you take every second number starting from index 0, you get the smallest `n` numbers.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It then sums the integers at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) and prints the result.
   - This approach ensures that the smallest `n` numbers are added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The program will work for all valid inputs as described in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.
