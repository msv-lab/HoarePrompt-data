The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of sides of a regular polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of connections to be made. The function returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices or edges connected to the corresponding index. The total number of elements across all lists in `l` is `2 * m`, indicating that each connection is counted twice, once in each of the two lists it connects. The original values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
