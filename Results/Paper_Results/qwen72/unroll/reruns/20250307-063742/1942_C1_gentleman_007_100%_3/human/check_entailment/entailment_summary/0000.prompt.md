Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` (1 <= num <= 10^9) and returns a list `p` containing all the prime numbers up to and including `num`. The function internally generates three lists: `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime`. The `prime` list indicates whether each number up to `num` is a prime number, `Highest_Prime` contains the highest prime factor for each number, and `Lowest_Prime` contains the lowest prime factor for each number. These internal lists are not returned or modified after the function concludes.

After the function concludes, `d` will include all prime factors of the initial `n` and their counts. If `n` is greater than 1 after the factorization process, the count of the largest prime factor in `d` is increased by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged.

 Output hints for function24:  The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It updates the `vis` list to mark all vertices that are reachable from `ver` as visited (True or 1). The function prints each visited vertex in the order they are processed. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the visitation status of all reachable vertices from the initial `ver`. The function does not return any value.
Function number 25 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        print(ver, end=' ')
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
''' 

 Output hints for function25:  The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph starting from the vertex `ver`. It prints each visited vertex in the order they are processed and updates the `vis` variable to mark these vertices as visited (1). The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the deque `q` is empty, all reachable vertices from `ver` have been printed, and their corresponding entries in `vis` are set to 1.
