The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of `p`. It returns `-1` if `x` is less than the smallest element in `p`. Otherwise, it returns the index of the largest element in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`, or the last index of the list if `x` is greater than or equal to all elements in `p`.
