The function `func_19` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x`. It returns the length of the list `p` if `x` is greater than the last element in `p`. Otherwise, it returns the smallest index `l` such that `p[l]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The function does not modify the input list `p` or any other variables.
