The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function uses global variables `graph` and `vis`, where `graph` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the graph, and `vis` is a list or dictionary used to track visited vertices. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it likely modifies the `vis` variable to mark the vertex `ver` as visited and may perform operations related to traversing the graph.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and uses global variables `graph` and `vis` to track and modify the visited status of vertices. It does not return a value but may update the `vis` variable and perform graph traversal operations.**
