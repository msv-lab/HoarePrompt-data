The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence within `arr`. After the function concludes, the list `l` contains the elements of `arr` that form the longest increasing subsequence, in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
