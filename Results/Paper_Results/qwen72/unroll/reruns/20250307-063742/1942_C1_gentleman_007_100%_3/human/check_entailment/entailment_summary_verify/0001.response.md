### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` are used to read input data, which is a necessary part of the solution. However, these functions alone do not solve the problem.

2. **Relevant Functions:**
   - The problem requires counting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices in a polygon.
   - The provided functions `func_24()` and `func_25()` are for graph traversal (DFS and BFS) and are not relevant to the problem of counting non-intersecting triangles in a polygon.

3. **Core Logic:**
   - The core logic for solving this problem involves sorting the chosen vertices and then counting the number of non-intersecting triangles.
   - The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by `x` chosen vertices in a polygon is `x - 2` (since each triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and the first two vertices do not form a triangle).

4. **Lack of Necessary Logic:**
   - The provided code does not include any function that performs the necessary logic to count the non-intersecting triangles.
   - The functions included in the code are either not relevant or do not address the core requirement of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided code does not solve the problem as it lacks the necessary logic to count non-intersecting triangles in a polygon.

Final: **False**
