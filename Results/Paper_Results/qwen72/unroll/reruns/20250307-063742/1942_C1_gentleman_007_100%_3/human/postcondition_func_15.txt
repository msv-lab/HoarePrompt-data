The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `mod` (an integer that can be -1 or a positive integer). It returns a list `dearr` containing the first `n+1` terms of a sequence. If `mod` is -1, the sequence is the derangement sequence. If `mod` is a positive integer, each term in the sequence is calculated as `(i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod` for `i` from 2 to `n`. The values of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged after the function execution.
