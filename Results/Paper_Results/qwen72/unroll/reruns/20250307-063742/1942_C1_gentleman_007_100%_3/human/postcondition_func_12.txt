The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` (4 <= n <= 10^9) and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective counts. After the function concludes, `d` will include all prime factors of the initial `n` and their counts. If `n` is greater than 1 after the factorization process, the count of the largest prime factor in `d` is increased by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged.
