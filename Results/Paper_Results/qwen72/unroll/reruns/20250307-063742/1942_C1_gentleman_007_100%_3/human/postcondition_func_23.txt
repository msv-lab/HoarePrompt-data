The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It updates the `vis` list to mark all vertices that are reachable from `ver` as visited (True or 1). The function prints each visited vertex in the order they are processed. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the visitation status of all reachable vertices from the initial `ver`. The function does not return any value.
