Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any function or logic that directly addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon. The functions defined in the code are unrelated to the problem and do not perform the required operations to solve it. For example, the function `func_1` reads integers from input, but there is no function that processes these inputs to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
