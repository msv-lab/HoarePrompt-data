The function `func_16` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. `n` is a positive integer, and `mod` is an integer that can be -1 or a positive integer. The function returns a list `dearr` which contains the first `n+1` terms of a sequence. If `mod` is -1, the sequence is the derangement sequence. If `mod` is a positive integer, the sequence is a custom sequence where each element is calculated as `(i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `mod` (an integer that can be -1 or a positive integer). It returns a list `dearr` containing the first `n+1` terms of either the derangement sequence if `mod` is -1, or a custom sequence based on the provided `mod` value.**
