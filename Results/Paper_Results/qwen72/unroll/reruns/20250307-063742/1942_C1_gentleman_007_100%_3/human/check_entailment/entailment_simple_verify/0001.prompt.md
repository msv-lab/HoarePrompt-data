You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program for the problem, let's break down the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of sides of the polygon `n`.
     - The number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`.
     - The maximum number of other vertices you can choose `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
     - The vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

### Key Points:
- The vertices chosen by Bessie are already given.
- You cannot choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code includes a large number of functions, but many of them are not relevant to the problem. Let's focus on the functions that might be used to solve the problem:

1. **`func_1()` and `func_2()`**:
   - These functions read input data. `func_1()` reads a single line of integers, and `func_2()` reads a single line and returns a list of integers. These functions are likely used to read the input data for the test cases.

2. **`func_24()` and `func_25()`**:
   - These functions perform depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) respectively. However, they are not relevant to the problem of counting non-intersecting triangles in a polygon.

3. **Relevant Functions:**
   - The problem requires counting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices. This can be done by considering the vertices in a circular manner and counting the number of triangles that can be formed without intersecting diagonals.

### Solution Approach:
- **Step 1: Read the input data.**
- **Step 2: For each test case:**
  - Sort the chosen vertices.
  - Calculate the number of non-intersecting triangles by considering the gaps between the chosen vertices.
  - The number of triangles formed by `x` vertices in a polygon is given by `x - 2` (since each triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and the first two vertices do not form a triangle).

### Correctness Check:
- The provided code does not include a function that directly solves the problem of counting non-intersecting triangles.
- The functions `func_24()` and `func_25()` are for graph traversal and are not needed for this problem.
- The problem can be solved with a simpler approach that involves sorting the chosen vertices and counting the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it lacks the necessary logic to count non-intersecting triangles in a polygon. The functions included are either not relevant or do not address the core requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
