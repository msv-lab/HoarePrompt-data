The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `num` and a dictionary `Prime_array` where keys are integers and values are their smallest prime factors. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the initial `num`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that prime factor divides the initial `num`. If `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary.
