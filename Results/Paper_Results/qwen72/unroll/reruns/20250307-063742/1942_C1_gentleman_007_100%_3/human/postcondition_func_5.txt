The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m` and returns a 2D list `l` of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) initialized to 0. For each of the `m` iterations, it calls `func_1()` to get a pair of integers (x, y), and sets the elements at positions (x, y) and (y, x) in the list `l` to 1. After the function concludes, the list `l` contains 1s at the specified positions and 0s elsewhere.
