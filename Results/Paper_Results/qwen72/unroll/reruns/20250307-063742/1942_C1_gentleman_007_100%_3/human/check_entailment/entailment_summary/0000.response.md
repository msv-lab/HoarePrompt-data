### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve a problem where Bessie has a regular polygon cake with \( n \) sides and has already chosen \( x \) vertices. The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing no more than \( y \) additional vertices. In this version of the problem, \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

The program reads the input, processes the vertices chosen by Bessie, and calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed using these vertices. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (where \( y = 0 \)).
   - It then reads \( x \) distinct integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \( x - 2 \). This is because the minimum number of triangles that can be formed with \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \).

3. **Processing Vertices:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are sorted.
   - The program checks for pairs of consecutive vertices in the sorted list that are 2 units apart. If such a pair is found, it increments `ans` by 1, as this pair can form a triangle with the next vertex in the sequence.
   - Additional checks are made to see if the first and last vertices in the sorted list can form a triangle with the vertices at positions 1 and \( n \) or 2 and \( n \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
  - The use of `input()` and `map(int, input().split())` is appropriate for reading the input.

- **Sorting and Vertex Processing:**
  - Sorting the vertices is necessary to identify consecutive pairs that can form triangles.
  - The logic for checking consecutive pairs and the special cases for the first and last vertices is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Functions Used:

- **func_1, func_2, func_3, func_4, func_5, func_6, func_7, func_8, func_9, func_10, func_11, func_12, func_13, func_14, func_15, func_16, func_17, func_18, func_19, func_20, func_21, func_22, func_23, func_24, func_25:**
  - While these functions are provided, they are not used in the main logic of the program. Therefore, their correctness is not relevant to the problem at hand.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake given the constraints and input format. The functions used in the main logic are appropriate and the program's output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
