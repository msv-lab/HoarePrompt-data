To determine the correctness of the given Python program for the problem, let's break down the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of sides of the polygon `n`.
     - The number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`.
     - The maximum number of other vertices you can choose `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
     - The vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

### Key Points:
- The vertices chosen by Bessie are already given.
- You cannot choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code includes a large number of functions, but many of them are not relevant to the problem. Let's focus on the functions that might be used to solve the problem:

1. **`func_1()` and `func_2()`**:
   - These functions read input data. `func_1()` reads a single line of integers, and `func_2()` reads a single line and returns a list of integers. These functions are likely used to read the input data for the test cases.

2. **`func_24()` and `func_25()`**:
   - These functions perform depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) respectively. However, they are not relevant to the problem of counting non-intersecting triangles in a polygon.

3. **Relevant Functions:**
   - The problem requires counting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices. This can be done by considering the vertices in a circular manner and counting the number of triangles that can be formed without intersecting diagonals.

### Solution Approach:
- **Step 1: Read the input data.**
- **Step 2: For each test case:**
  - Sort the chosen vertices.
  - Calculate the number of non-intersecting triangles by considering the gaps between the chosen vertices.
  - The number of triangles formed by `x` vertices in a polygon is given by `x - 2` (since each triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and the first two vertices do not form a triangle).

### Correctness Check:
- The provided code does not include a function that directly solves the problem of counting non-intersecting triangles.
- The functions `func_24()` and `func_25()` are for graph traversal and are not needed for this problem.
- The problem can be solved with a simpler approach that involves sorting the chosen vertices and counting the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it lacks the necessary logic to count non-intersecting triangles in a polygon. The functions included are either not relevant or do not address the core requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
