The only object in the loop head is the deque `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one element. Given the state right before the loop, `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`. Since `ver` is an integer and is already in `q`, the length of `q` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the graph, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to track visited vertices with `vis[ver]` set to 1, `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`**
