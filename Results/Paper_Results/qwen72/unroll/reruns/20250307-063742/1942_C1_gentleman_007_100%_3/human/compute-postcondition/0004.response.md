Output State: **The deque `q` is empty, and the vertices that were processed are printed in the order they were visited. The `vis` list or dictionary has been updated to mark all visited vertices as 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until the deque `q` is empty, so after the loop, `q` will be empty.
- The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement prints each vertex as it is processed, so the output will be the sequence of vertices visited in the order they were processed.
- The `vis` list or dictionary is updated to mark each vertex as visited (set to 1) when it is processed, so after the loop, `vis` will contain 1 for all vertices that were visited.
