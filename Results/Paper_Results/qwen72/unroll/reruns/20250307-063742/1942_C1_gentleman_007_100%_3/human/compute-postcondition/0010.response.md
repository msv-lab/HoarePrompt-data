Functionality: ** The function `func_22` accepts two non-empty lists `a` and `b` of integers or characters. It computes the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b` and returns this LCS as a string `s` in the correct order. The input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
