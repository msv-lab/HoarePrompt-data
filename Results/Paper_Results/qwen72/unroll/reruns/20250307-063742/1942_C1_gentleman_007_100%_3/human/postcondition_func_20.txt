The function `func_21` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns the result of `a` raised to the power of `b`, modulo `mod`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. After the function concludes, the value of `a` within the function is updated to the square of its initial value, raised to the power of the number of times `b` was right-shifted, modulo `mod`, but this updated value is not returned or accessible outside the function. The value of `b` is reduced to 0 during the function's execution. If `b` is 0 initially, the function returns 1 modulo `mod`.
