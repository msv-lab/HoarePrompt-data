### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
   - It initializes the answer `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

2. **Vertex Sorting:**
   - The chosen vertices are read into a list `arr` and then sorted. This ensures that the vertices are processed in a consistent order.

3. **Triangle Counting:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks for specific conditions to increment the triangle count:
     - If two consecutive vertices in the sorted list are exactly two positions apart, it adds one to the triangle count.
     - If the last vertex in the sorted list is `n - 1` and the first vertex is `1`, it adds one to the triangle count.
     - If the last vertex in the sorted list is `n` and the first vertex is `2`, it adds one to the triangle count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final triangle count for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Initial Triangle Count:**
  - The initial count `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

- **Additional Triangle Count:**
  - The program checks for specific conditions to increment the triangle count:
    - **Condition 1:** `arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]` ensures that two consecutive vertices are exactly two positions apart, which can form an additional triangle.
    - **Condition 2:** `arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1` checks if the last and first vertices form a triangle with the vertex `n`.
    - **Condition 3:** `arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2` checks if the last and first vertices form a triangle with the vertex `n - 1`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases correctly by checking the specific conditions for the vertices.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The conditions and the initial triangle count are correctly applied, and the program handles the input and output as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
