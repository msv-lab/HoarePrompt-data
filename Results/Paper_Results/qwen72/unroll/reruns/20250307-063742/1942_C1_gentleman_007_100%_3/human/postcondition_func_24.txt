The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph starting from the vertex `ver`. It prints each visited vertex in the order they are processed and updates the `vis` variable to mark these vertices as visited (1). The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the deque `q` is empty, all reachable vertices from `ver` have been printed, and their corresponding entries in `vis` are set to 1.
