The function `func_15` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns a list `f` of `n + 1` integers, where each element `f[i]` is the factorial of `i` modulo `mod`. The final state of the program is that `f` contains the computed factorials modulo `mod` for all integers from 0 to `n`.
