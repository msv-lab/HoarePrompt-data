The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` (1 <= num <= 10^9) and returns a list `p` containing all the prime numbers up to and including `num`. The function internally generates three lists: `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime`. The `prime` list indicates whether each number up to `num` is a prime number, `Highest_Prime` contains the highest prime factor for each number, and `Lowest_Prime` contains the lowest prime factor for each number. These internal lists are not returned or modified after the function concludes.
