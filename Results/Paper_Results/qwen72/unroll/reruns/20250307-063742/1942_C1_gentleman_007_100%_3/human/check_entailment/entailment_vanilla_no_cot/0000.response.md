Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions in the program are not relevant to the problem at hand. For example, functions like `func_11`, `func_13`, and `func_16` deal with prime numbers and derangements, which are not applicable to this geometric problem.

To solve this problem, you would need to focus on the geometry of the polygon and the combinatorial aspects of choosing vertices to form non-intersecting triangles. The program should include logic to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices, considering that no additional vertices can be chosen (since \( y = 0 \)).

Here's a brief outline of what the correct approach might look like:
1. Parse the input to get the number of sides \( n \) and the vertices chosen by Bessie.
2. Sort the chosen vertices to facilitate the calculation of the number of triangles.
3. Calculate the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices. This can be done by considering the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and using the properties of polygons to count the triangles.
4. Output the result for each test case.

The provided program does not perform any of these steps, hence it is incorrect for the given problem.
