Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (representing the length of a binary string) followed by the binary string `a` of length `n`. It processes each binary string to find the position `pos` that minimizes the absolute difference between the total number of '1's and '0's in the string and the number of '1's and '0's on either side of `pos`. The function prints the position `pos` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `t` is 0. **
