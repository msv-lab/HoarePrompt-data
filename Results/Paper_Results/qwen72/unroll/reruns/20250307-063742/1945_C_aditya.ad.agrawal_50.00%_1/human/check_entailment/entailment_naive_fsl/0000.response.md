Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (output 0) or after the last house (output n). For example, consider the input where all residents want to live on the left side:

Input:
```
1
3
000
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs 1 instead of 0. This is because the initial check `if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:` does not correctly account for the scenario where the road should be laid before the first house. Additionally, the program does not check the condition for laying the road after the last house, which is also a potential valid position.
