#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where multiple test cases are provided, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function should handle the input and output as described in the problem, but the function definition provided does not include parameters for `n` and `a`. The function should be designed to read input and write output directly, as is common in competitive programming problems.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        input_string = input()
        
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        
        z = arr.count(0)
        
        o = arr.count(1)
        
        z_r = z
        
        o_r = o
        
        z_l = 0
        
        o_l = 0
        
        dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
        
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
            b_d = dist
        else:
            b_d = 30001
        
        for i in arr:
            pos += 1
            if i == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
                2 - pos):
                ans = pos
                b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
        
        print(ans)
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all test cases, and the variable `t` is now 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (representing the length of a binary string) followed by the binary string `a` of length `n`. It processes each binary string to find the position `pos` that minimizes the absolute difference between the total number of '1's and '0's in the string and the number of '1's and '0's on either side of `pos`. The function prints the position `pos` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `t` is 0.
