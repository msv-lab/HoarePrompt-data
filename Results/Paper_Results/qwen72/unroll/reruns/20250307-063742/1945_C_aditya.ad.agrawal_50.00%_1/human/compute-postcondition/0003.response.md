Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1' from the input. It then processes these inputs and writes the result to the output. If `n` is less than 3 or greater than 300,000, the function should handle this invalid input appropriately. Otherwise, it processes the string `a` and returns the result based on the problem's requirements.**
