Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where multiple test cases are provided, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function should handle the input and output as described in the problem, but the function definition provided does not include parameters for `n` and `a`. The function should be designed to read input and write output directly, as is common in competitive programming problems.**
