### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.
   - If such an array cannot be found, the program should output \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \(X\) and initializes an empty list `result`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with \(X - 1\) and the `result` list.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences when \(X - 1\) is used as the input.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The function calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`.
     - It appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
     - It recursively calls itself with the modified `number` (i.e., `number - (1 << size) + 1`) and the updated `sequence`.
     - After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in the `sequence` by the result of the recursive call.
     - Finally, it returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The base case correctly handles the scenario where no more elements are needed.
   - The recursive case correctly calculates the `size` and appends the necessary elements to the `sequence`.
   - The incrementing of specific elements ensures that the sequence maintains the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the elements are within the specified range.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as \(X = 2\) and \(X = 10^{18}\) correctly.
   - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) if it is impossible to find a sequence with the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the `result` list and the elements of the list.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences for the given range of \(X\). The function `func_1` is designed to handle the problem recursively and ensures that the sequence length and element values are within the specified constraints.

**Correctness: True**
