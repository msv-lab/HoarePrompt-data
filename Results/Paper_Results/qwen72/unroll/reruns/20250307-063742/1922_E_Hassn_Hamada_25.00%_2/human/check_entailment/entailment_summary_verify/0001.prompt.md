You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. The function recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in the `sequence` by the result of the recursive call. Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. The `sequence` is modified to contain additional elements and some elements are incremented.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that satisfies the condition of having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

3. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It first checks if `number` is zero, in which case it returns 0 (base case).
   - It then finds the largest \( k \) such that \( (1 << k + 1) - 1 \leq number \). This is equivalent to finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`.
   - It appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated number \( number - (1 << k) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending integers in a specific pattern and modifying them based on the recursive calls.
   - The idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2 to ensure that the sequence has the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not explicitly checked in the given code), it should print \(-1\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem description specifies \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \), so \( X = 1 \) is not a valid input.
   - The program should also handle the case where \( X \) is very large, ensuring the sequence length does not exceed 200.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The recursive approach in `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence generation logic is based on the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2, which ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sequence length exceeds 200, but the recursive logic and the constraints on \( X \) should ensure that this does not happen.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The recursive approach and the sequence modification logic are sound and should produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
