Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `X = 2`. According to the problem description, for `X = 2`, there should be an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. However, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `[0]`, which has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself, but the empty subsequence is counted as one, not two). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
