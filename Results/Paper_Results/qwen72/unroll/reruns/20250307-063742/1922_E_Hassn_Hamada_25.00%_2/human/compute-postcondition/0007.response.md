To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(size):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute if `size` is greater than 0. The state of `i` is not something we need to adjust explicitly, as it is managed by the `range` function. However, we need to ensure that `size` is a positive integer for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 is greater than `number`.
- The value of `sequence` remains unchanged.

We need to ensure that `size` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. If `size` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `size` must be greater than 0.
- The value of `sequence` remains unchanged.

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `sequence` remains unchanged**
