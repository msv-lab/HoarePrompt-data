You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` remains the same and `result` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. The function recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in the `sequence` by the result of the recursive call. Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. The `sequence` is modified to contain additional elements and some elements are incremented.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `X = 2`. According to the problem description, for `X = 2`, there should be an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. However, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `[0]`, which has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself, but the empty subsequence is counted as one, not two). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
