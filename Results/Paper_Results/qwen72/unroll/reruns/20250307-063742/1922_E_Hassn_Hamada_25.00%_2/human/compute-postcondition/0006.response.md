Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size + 1) - 1 is greater than `number`. The value of `sequence` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
The loop increments the variable `size` until the condition `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1 <= number` is no longer true. This means that the loop stops when `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` becomes greater than `number`.

- **`1 << (size + 1)`** is a bitwise operation that shifts the number 1 to the left by `(size + 1)` positions, effectively calculating \(2^{(size + 1)}\).
- **`(1 << (size + 1)) - 1`** is then \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\).

The loop continues to increment `size` until \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`. Therefore, the final value of `size` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`.

The variable `sequence` is not modified within the loop, so its state remains unchanged.
