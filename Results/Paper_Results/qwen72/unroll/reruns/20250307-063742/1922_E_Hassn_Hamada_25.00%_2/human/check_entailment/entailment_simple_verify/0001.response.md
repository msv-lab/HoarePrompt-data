### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that satisfies the condition of having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

3. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It first checks if `number` is zero, in which case it returns 0 (base case).
   - It then finds the largest \( k \) such that \( (1 << k + 1) - 1 \leq number \). This is equivalent to finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`.
   - It appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated number \( number - (1 << k) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending integers in a specific pattern and modifying them based on the recursive calls.
   - The idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2 to ensure that the sequence has the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not explicitly checked in the given code), it should print \(-1\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem description specifies \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \), so \( X = 1 \) is not a valid input.
   - The program should also handle the case where \( X \) is very large, ensuring the sequence length does not exceed 200. The recursive logic and the constraints on \( X \) should ensure that this does not happen.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The recursive approach in `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence generation logic is based on the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2, which ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sequence length exceeds 200, but the recursive logic and the constraints on \( X \) should ensure that this does not happen.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Base Case**:
  - When `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct. This means the sequence has no elements to add, and the length of the sequence remains unchanged.

- **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
  - The loop `while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` finds the largest \( k \) such that \( (1 << k + 1) - 1 \leq number \). This is correct and ensures that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.

- **Appending to the Sequence**:
  - The loop `for i in range(size): sequence.append(i)` appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence. This is correct and ensures that the sequence is built with the initial elements.

- **Recursive Call**:
  - The recursive call `result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` is correct. It updates the `number` and continues building the sequence.

- **Modifying the Sequence**:
  - The loop `for i in range(size): sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them. This is correct and ensures that the sequence has the required number of increasing subsequences.

- **Return Value**:
  - The function returns `size + result`, which is the total length of the sequence generated by the current call and the recursive call. This is correct and ensures that the sequence length is correctly calculated.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The recursive approach and the sequence modification logic are sound and should produce the correct number of increasing subsequences. The constraints on \( X \) and the recursive logic ensure that the sequence length does not exceed 200.

Final: **True**
