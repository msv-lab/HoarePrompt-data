### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that satisfies the condition of having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

3. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It first checks if `number` is zero, in which case it returns 0 (base case).
   - It then finds the largest \( k \) such that \( (1 << k + 1) - 1 \leq number \). This is equivalent to finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`.
   - It appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated number \( number - (1 << k) + 1 \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending integers in a specific pattern and modifying them based on the recursive calls.
   - The idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2 to ensure that the sequence has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is constructed in such a way that it guarantees the correct number of increasing subsequences by leveraging the combinatorial properties of binary numbers.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not explicitly checked in the given code), it should print \(-1\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem description specifies \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \), so \( X = 1 \) is not a valid input.
   - The program should also handle the case where \( X \) is very large, ensuring the sequence length does not exceed 200.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The recursive approach in `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence generation logic is based on the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2, which ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sequence length exceeds 200, but the recursive logic and the constraints on \( X \) should ensure that this does not happen.

8. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - The sequence is built by appending integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) and then modifying the last `result` elements by adding `result` to them.
   - The assertions in the annotated code ensure that the indices used for modification are within the valid range of the sequence.

9. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is 1, but since \( X \) is constrained to be at least 2, this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sequence length exceeds 200, but the recursive logic and the constraints on \( X \) should ensure that this does not happen.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The recursive approach and the sequence modification logic are sound and should produce the correct number of increasing subsequences. The annotations and the problem constraints support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
