Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\) is greater than `number`. It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. The function recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in the `sequence` by the result of the recursive call. Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. The `sequence` is modified to contain additional elements and some elements are incremented. **
