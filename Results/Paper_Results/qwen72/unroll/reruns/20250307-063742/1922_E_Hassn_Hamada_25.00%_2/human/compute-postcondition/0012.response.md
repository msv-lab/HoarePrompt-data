To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and understand how it modifies the variables.

### Initial State:
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \) is greater than `number`.
- `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(size):
    assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `size` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `size - 1`.
2. **Assertion**: The assertion ensures that the index `-result - i - 1` is within the bounds of the `sequence` list. This means that `result` must be a non-negative integer, and the index must be valid.
3. **Modification**: In each iteration, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
- **Initial `sequence`**: `[0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1]`
- **Initial `result`**: This is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. Let's denote this value as `r`.

For each iteration `i`:
- The index `-r - i - 1` is used to access an element in the `sequence` list.
- The element at this index is incremented by `r`.

### Example:
Let's assume `size = 4` and `result = 2` for simplicity:
- **Initial `sequence`**: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Initial `result`**: `2`

**Iteration 0**:
- Index: `-2 - 0 - 1 = -3` (which is the third element from the end, i.e., index 1)
- `sequence[1] += 2` → `sequence` becomes `[0, 3, 2, 3]`

**Iteration 1**:
- Index: `-2 - 1 - 1 = -4` (which is the fourth element from the end, i.e., index 0)
- `sequence[0] += 2` → `sequence` becomes `[2, 3, 2, 3]`

**Iteration 2**:
- Index: `-2 - 2 - 1 = -5` (which is out of bounds, but the assertion ensures it is valid)
- This iteration would not be possible because the index is out of bounds, but the assertion ensures it is valid.

**Iteration 3**:
- Index: `-2 - 3 - 1 = -6` (which is out of bounds, but the assertion ensures it is valid)
- This iteration would not be possible because the index is out of bounds, but the assertion ensures it is valid.

### General Case:
- The loop will modify the elements in the `sequence` list starting from the element at index `-result - 1` and moving backwards.
- Each element at the specified index will be incremented by `result`.

### Final Output State:
- **`size`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`sequence`**: The elements at indices `-result - 1` to `-result - size - 1` (inclusive) will be incremented by `result`.
- **`result`**: Remains unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
- The `size` variable remains the same as it was initially.
- The `sequence` list will have its elements at specific indices (determined by `result` and the loop index `i`) incremented by the value of `result`.
- The `result` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`size` remains the same, `sequence` has its elements at indices `-result - 1` to `-result - size - 1` incremented by `result`, and `result` remains unchanged.**
