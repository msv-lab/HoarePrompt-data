Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct solution for the problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence. It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence based on the input number `number`. It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`.
   - It then appends the first `size` integers to the sequence.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed (`number - (1 << size) + 1`).
   - After the recursive call, it adjusts the elements of the sequence to ensure the increasing subsequence count is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the input number `n` is 1, the function `func_1` will return 0, and the sequence will be empty, which is a valid output since an empty subsequence is considered increasing.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the function `func_1` ensure that the indices used to modify the sequence are within valid bounds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning an empty sequence.
   - For other values of `n`, the program generates a sequence that meets the requirements of having exactly `n` increasing subsequences.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and constraints, making it a correct solution.
