The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Output:
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` remains the same and `result` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If a certain condition is met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the length of `sequence` and an unchanged `result`.**
