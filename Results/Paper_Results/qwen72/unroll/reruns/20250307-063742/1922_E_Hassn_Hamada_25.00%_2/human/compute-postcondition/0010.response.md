Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size + 1) - 1 is greater than `number`. The value of `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size - 1`. `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.** 

The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_1` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The value of `size` and the list `sequence` remain unchanged. The specific value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `number` and `size`.
