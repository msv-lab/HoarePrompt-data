The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function has two possible return values:

- **Case_1:** The function returns 1.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of `x // y` for each iteration plus the number of iterations minus 1, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`. `cnt` is not equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). If a certain condition is met, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `x // y` for each iteration plus the number of iterations minus 1, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`.**
