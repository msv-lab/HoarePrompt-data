Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution does not align with the problem's conditions. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified to checking if \(a' + b'\) is a multiple of \(b'\) where \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) with \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).

2. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - This function is correct and can be used to compute the gcd.

3. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
   - It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to the count.
   - If the count is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

4. **Issues with func_2**:
   - The formula \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) is not derived from the problem's conditions.
   - The logic of adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
   - Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Count the number of valid pairs.

6. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - A more efficient approach involves precomputing gcd values and using them to count valid pairs more efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) and the logic for counting valid pairs are incorrect.

Final: **False**
