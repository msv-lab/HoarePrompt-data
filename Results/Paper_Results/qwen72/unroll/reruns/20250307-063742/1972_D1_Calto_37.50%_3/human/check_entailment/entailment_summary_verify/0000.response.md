### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided functions and the original assessment:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It correctly returns \(\gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:

- The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) and the subsequent addition to `cnt` does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked in the function.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)**:
  - Valid pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2).
  - The function `func_2` should return 3.
  - However, the function `func_2` will return 2, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The function's approach is flawed and does not handle the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
