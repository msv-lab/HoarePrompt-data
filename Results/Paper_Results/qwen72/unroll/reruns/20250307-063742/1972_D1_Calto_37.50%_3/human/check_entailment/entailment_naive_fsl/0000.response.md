Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` has a flawed approach and does not handle the problem correctly. For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program's `func_2` function will return 2, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program does not correctly count the valid pairs for all potential cases.
