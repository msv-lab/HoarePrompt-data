### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`:** This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **`func_2(n, m)`:** This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), `x` is set to \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and `y` is set to \(i \cdot i\).
   - The count `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y` plus 1 if \(i > 1\).
   - This logic does not directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated arithmetic operations.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A correct implementation would involve nested loops to iterate over all \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition for each pair.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic inside the function does not match the required condition.
