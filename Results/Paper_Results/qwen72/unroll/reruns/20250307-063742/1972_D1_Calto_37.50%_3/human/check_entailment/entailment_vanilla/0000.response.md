Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
1. **GCD Property**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is a divisor of both \(a\) and \(b\). Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
2. **Condition Simplification**: The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d
   \]
   Substituting \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\), we get:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\). This implies \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### func_1(a, b):
- This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\).
- It is a standard and correct implementation.

#### func_2(n, m):
- The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
- It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to the count.
- If the count is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

### Issues with func_2(n, m):
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The formula \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) does not align with the problem's conditions.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic of adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) is not derived from the problem's conditions.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves:
1. Using the properties of gcd and the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. Precomputing the gcd values and using them to count valid pairs more efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) and the logic for counting valid pairs are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
