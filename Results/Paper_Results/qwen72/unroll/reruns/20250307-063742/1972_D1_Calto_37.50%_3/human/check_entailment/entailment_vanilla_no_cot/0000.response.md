Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions, but it does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` seems to be using a formula that is not derived from the problem statement. Specifically, the line `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each pair (a, b) in the range \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).

2. **Missing GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers, but it is not used in `func_2` to check the condition.

3. **Incorrect Range in Loop**:
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over `range(1, m)`, which means it does not include the value `m`. This is incorrect because `b` should range from 1 to `m`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
