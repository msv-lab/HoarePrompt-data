Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the requirements and the provided functions:

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

2. **Pair Counting (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the required conditions. Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

The provided `func_2` does not perform these steps. Instead, it uses a formula that does not correspond to the problem's requirements. The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the problem's conditions and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
