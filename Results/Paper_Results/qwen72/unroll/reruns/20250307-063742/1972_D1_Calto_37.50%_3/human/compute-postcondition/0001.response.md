The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 1, and `cnt` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
