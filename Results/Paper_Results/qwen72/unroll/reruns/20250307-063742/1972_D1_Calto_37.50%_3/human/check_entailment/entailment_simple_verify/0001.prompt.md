You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
1. **GCD Property**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is a divisor of both \(a\) and \(b\). Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
2. **Condition Simplification**: The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d
   \]
   Substituting \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\), we get:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\). This implies \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### func_1(a, b):
- This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\).
- It is a standard and correct implementation.

#### func_2(n, m):
- The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
- It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to the count.
- If the count is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

### Issues with func_2(n, m):
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The formula \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) does not align with the problem's conditions.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic of adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) is not derived from the problem's conditions.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves:
1. Using the properties of gcd and the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. Precomputing the gcd values and using them to count valid pairs more efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) and the logic for counting valid pairs are incorrect.
