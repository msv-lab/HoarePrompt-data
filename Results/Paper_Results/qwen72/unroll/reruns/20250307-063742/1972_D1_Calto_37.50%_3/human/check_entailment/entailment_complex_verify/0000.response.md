### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - The state annotations are accurate: after the function concludes, `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.
     - If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations for `func_1` are correct and match the expected behavior of the GCD function.
   - The annotations for `func_2` describe the state of the program accurately but do not explain why the logic is flawed.

4. **Flaw in `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's condition.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each pair \((a, b)\) within the given ranges, but the current implementation does not do this.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
     - The program's `func_2` function will return 2, which is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem.
   - The function `func_2` has a flawed approach and does not handle the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
