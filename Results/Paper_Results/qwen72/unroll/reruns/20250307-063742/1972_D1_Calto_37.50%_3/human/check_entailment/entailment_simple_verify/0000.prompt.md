You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `x // y` for each iteration plus the number of iterations minus 1, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: *`cnt` is the sum of `x // y` for each iteration plus the number of iterations minus 1, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `x // y` for each iteration plus the number of iterations minus 1, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`. `cnt` is not equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` has a flawed approach and does not handle the problem correctly. For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program's `func_2` function will return 2, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program does not correctly count the valid pairs for all potential cases.
