Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (GCD Calculation)**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state after the function call is that `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
   - This function is correct and essential for the problem, but it is not used in the main logic of `func_2`.

3. **Function 2 (Main Logic)**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`:
     - `x` is calculated as \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\).
     - `y` is calculated as \(i \cdot i\).
     - `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - After the loop, if `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `cnt`.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the problem's conditions.
   - Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the increment of `cnt` do not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies the condition.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\). This gives a total of 14 pairs, which matches the expected output.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's conditions. The formula used in the loop and the way `cnt` is incremented do not align with the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
