### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state annotations are accurate:
     - Before the function call: \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
     - After the function call: \(a\) is the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\), and \(b\) is 0.
     - The function returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - The loop iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(i = m-1\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`.
     - This logic does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Flawed Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked directly.
   - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not correspond to the correct mathematical formulation of the problem.
   - The addition of \((i > 1)\) is arbitrary and does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The program's `func_2` function will return 2, which is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem description.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not handle the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
