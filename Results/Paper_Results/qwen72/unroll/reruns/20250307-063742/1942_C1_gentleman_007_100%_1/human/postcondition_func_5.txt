The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `4 <= n <= 10^9` and `0 <= m <= n`. It returns a list of lists `l` of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). Initially, all elements in `l` are set to 0. For each of the `m` iterations, the function `func_1` is called to generate a pair of integers (x, y). The elements at positions (x, y) and (y, x) in `l` are set to 1. The final state of the program is a list of lists `l` where the specified positions are marked with 1, and all other elements remain 0.
