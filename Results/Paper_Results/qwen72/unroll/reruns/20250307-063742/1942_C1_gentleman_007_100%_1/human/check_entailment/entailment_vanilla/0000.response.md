### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - The second line of each test case provides the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - To form a triangle in a polygon, we need three vertices.
   - The chosen vertices must be such that they do not form intersecting diagonals.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `x` chosen vertices can be determined by the number of vertices and their arrangement.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - The problem can be solved by recognizing that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `x` vertices is `x - 2`.
   - This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the first triangle uses 3 vertices, the second triangle uses 2 new vertices (one shared with the first triangle), and so on.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of triangles is `x - 2`.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code is a collection of functions, but none of them directly solve the problem as described.
   - The functions seem to be related to various algorithms and data structures, but they are not used in the context of solving this specific problem.
   - The problem can be solved with a simple calculation, and none of the provided functions perform this calculation.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The correct solution would involve reading the input, calculating `x - 2`, and printing the result for each test case.
