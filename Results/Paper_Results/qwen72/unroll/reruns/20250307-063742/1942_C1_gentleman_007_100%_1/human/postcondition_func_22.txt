The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed from `arr`. The function modifies a local list `l` to contain elements from `arr` in non-decreasing order, which represents the longest increasing subsequence. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `l` contains the elements of the longest increasing subsequence, and the function returns the length of this list.
