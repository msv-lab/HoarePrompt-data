The only object in the loop head is the deque `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one element. According to the state right before the loop, `q` is a deque containing the element `ver`. This means `q` already has one element, so the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`ver` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` is a deque containing the element `ver`**
