The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` (4 <= n <= 10^9) and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each prime factor is a key in the dictionary, and its corresponding value is the exponent indicating how many times the prime factor divides `n`. If `n` is greater than 1 after the factorization process, it is added to the dictionary with an exponent of 1 (or its existing exponent is incremented by 1). The function does not modify the input `n` but rather computes and returns the prime factorization as a dictionary.
