Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem is about maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be cut from a regular polygon with given vertices. However, the provided functions do not seem to address this problem directly. They include a variety of functions for different purposes, such as prime factorization, greatest common divisor calculation, and others, which are not relevant to the problem of cutting a polygon into triangles.

To solve the problem, you would need to:

1. **Identify the chosen vertices**: The vertices Bessie has chosen.
2. **Determine the number of triangles**: Calculate how many non-intersecting triangles can be formed using the chosen vertices.

A correct approach would involve:

- Sorting the chosen vertices.
- Calculating the number of triangles that can be formed by considering the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
- Ensuring that the diagonals do not intersect.

The provided functions do not perform these specific tasks, and there is no clear indication of how they would be used to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
