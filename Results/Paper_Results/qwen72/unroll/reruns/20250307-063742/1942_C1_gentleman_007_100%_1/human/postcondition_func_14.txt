The function `func_15` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns a list `f` containing the first `n+1` factorials, each computed modulo `mod`. The list `f` has `n+1` elements, where `f[i]` represents the factorial of `i` modulo `mod` for `0 ≤ i ≤ n`.
