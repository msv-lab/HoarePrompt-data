Functionality: ** The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It prints each vertex in the order it is visited and updates the `vis` list to mark vertices as visited (1) or not visited (0). After the function concludes, all vertices reachable from `ver` will have been printed, and the `vis` list will reflect the visited status of each vertex. The function does not return any value. **
