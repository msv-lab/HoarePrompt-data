You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and mod is an integer that can be -1 or a positive integer.
def func_16(n, mod):
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `mod` is -1, `dearr` is a list containing the first `n + 1` elements of the derangement sequence.
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `mod` is an integer that can be a positive integer, `dearr` is a list containing the values `[1, 0, (1 * (1 + 0) % mod), (2 * (dearr[2] + 1) % mod), ..., ((n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2]) % mod)]`.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, and `mod` is an integer that can be -1 or a positive integer. If `mod` is -1, `dearr` is a list containing the first `n + 1` elements of the derangement sequence. Otherwise, `dearr` is a list containing the values `[1, 0, (1 * (1 + 0) % mod), (2 * (dearr[2] + 1) % mod), ..., ((n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2]) % mod)]`.
    return dearr
    #The program returns the list `dearr` which contains the first `n + 1` elements of the derangement sequence if `mod` is -1, or a list of values calculated using the formula `[(1 * (1 + 0) % mod), (2 * (dearr[2] + 1) % mod), ..., ((n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2]) % mod)]` if `mod` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. If `mod` is -1, it returns the first `n + 1` elements of the derangement sequence. If `mod` is a positive integer, it returns a list of values calculated using a specific formula based on the derangement sequence and the modulus `mod`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `dearr` which contains the first `n + 1` elements of the derangement sequence if `mod` is -1, or a list of values calculated using the formula `[(1 * (1 + 0) % mod), (2 * (dearr[2] + 1) % mod), ..., ((n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2]) % mod)]` if `mod` is a positive integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
