Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic related to the problem description. The problem requires a function to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. However, the program includes a collection of unrelated functions that do not address the specific requirements of the problem. For example, there are functions for generating prime numbers, calculating greatest common divisors, and performing binary searches, none of which are relevant to the task of maximizing the number of triangular pieces from a polygon. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem for any potential case.
