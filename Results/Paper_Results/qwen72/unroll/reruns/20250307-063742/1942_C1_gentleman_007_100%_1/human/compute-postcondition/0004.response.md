To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop is a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that traverses a graph starting from a given vertex `ver`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex.
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, indicating that the starting vertex has been visited.
   - `q` is a deque containing the element `ver`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `q` is not empty.
   - In each iteration, the leftmost element of `q` is removed and assigned to `ver`.
   - The current vertex `ver` is printed.
   - For each adjacent node of `ver` in `graph[ver]`:
     - If the node has not been visited (`vis[node]` is 0), it is appended to `q` and marked as visited (`vis[node]` is set to 1).

3. **Output State:**
   - The loop will print all vertices in the graph that are reachable from the starting vertex `ver` in the order they are visited.
   - The deque `q` will be empty after the loop finishes because all reachable vertices have been processed.
   - The list `vis` will have 1s for all vertices that have been visited and 0s for any vertices that were not reachable from the starting vertex.

Given the initial state and the loop code, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `vis` contains 1s for all vertices that are reachable from the starting vertex `ver` and 0s for any vertices that are not reachable. The vertices are printed in the order they are visited, which is the breadth-first search order starting from `ver`.**
