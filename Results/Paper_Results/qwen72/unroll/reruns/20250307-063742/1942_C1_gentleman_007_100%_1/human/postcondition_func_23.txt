The function `func_24` accepts a vertex `ver` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It prints each visited vertex and marks it as visited in the `vis` list. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, `ver` is the last vertex that was processed, and `vis` contains 1s for all vertices that were visited during the search. The function does not return any value.
