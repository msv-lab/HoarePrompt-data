The function `func_21` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns the result of `a` raised to the power of `b`, modulo `mod`. After the function call, the input parameters `a` and `b` are unchanged, and the program state is such that the returned value `ans` is the correct result of the modular exponentiation.
