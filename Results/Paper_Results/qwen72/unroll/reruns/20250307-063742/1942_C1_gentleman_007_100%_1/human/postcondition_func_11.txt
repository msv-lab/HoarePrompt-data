The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `num` greater than 1 and a list or dictionary `Prime_array`. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the initial `num`, and each value is the count of how many times that prime factor divides the initial `num`. If the initial `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary.
