The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` (where `num` >= 2) and returns a list of all prime numbers from 2 to `num`. After the function concludes, the `prime` list contains `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers from index 2 to `num`. The `Highest_Prime` list contains the highest prime factor for each index from 2 to `num`, and the `Lowest_Prime` list contains the lowest prime factor for each index from 2 to `num`. The variable `p` is a list of all prime numbers from 2 to `num`.
