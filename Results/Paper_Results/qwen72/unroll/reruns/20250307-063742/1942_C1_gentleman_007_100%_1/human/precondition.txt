The function `imap` is intended to handle input for multiple numbers, typically used in competitive programming or similar contexts where multiple integers are provided on a single line. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters or a return type, and the problem description requires a function that processes specific inputs related to a polygon and vertices. The actual precondition for the problem-solving function would be: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer and is always 0, and the list of `x` integers represents the vertices Bessie has chosen, where each integer is distinct and within the range [1, n].
