### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where Bessie has chosen `x` vertices to form diagonals.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by forming diagonals using the chosen vertices.
   - The maximum number of additional vertices you can choose is `y`, but in this version, `y = 0`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It initializes the answer `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the initial number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.
   - It reads the chosen vertices `arr` and sorts them.
   - It then checks for specific conditions to increment `ans`:
     - If two consecutive vertices in `arr` are exactly 2 positions apart, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the last vertex in `arr` is `n - 1` and the first vertex is 1, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the last vertex in `arr` is `n` and the first vertex is 2, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1** to **Function 23** are not directly used in the main logic of the program. They are utility functions for various purposes, but they are not called in the main program.
   - **Function 24** and **Function 25** are also not used in the main logic and are related to graph traversal (DFS and BFS), which are not relevant to this problem.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is correct for the given constraints and problem description.
   - The initial number of triangles `x - 2` is a good starting point because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles.
   - The additional checks for specific conditions (vertices being 2 positions apart, and vertices 1 and `n-1` or 2 and `n` being chosen) are also correct and help in maximizing the number of triangles.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is 2 or 3, where the number of triangles is 0 or 1, respectively.
   - The conditions for incrementing `ans` are well-defined and cover all necessary cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem and constraints. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

**Correctness: True**
