The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges or connections to be added, with the constraint 0 <= m <= n. The function returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists. Each of these inner lists at index `x` and `y` (as determined by the values returned by `func_1()`) will have the corresponding `y` and `x` values appended to them, respectively. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `l` reflects the added connections.
