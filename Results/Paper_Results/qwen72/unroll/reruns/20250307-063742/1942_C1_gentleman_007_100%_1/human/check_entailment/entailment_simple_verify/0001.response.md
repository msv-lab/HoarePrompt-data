### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - The second line of each test case provides the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - To form a triangle in a polygon, we need three vertices.
   - The chosen vertices must be such that they do not form intersecting diagonals.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `x` chosen vertices can be determined by the number of vertices and their arrangement.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is `x - 2` because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the first triangle uses 3 vertices, the second triangle uses 2 new vertices (one shared with the first triangle), and so on.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - The provided code reads the input, sorts the chosen vertices, and then checks for specific conditions to increment the answer.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`.
   - The code then checks for consecutive vertices that are exactly 2 apart and increments `ans` if such pairs are found.
   - Additionally, it checks for specific boundary conditions where the first and last vertices form a triangle with the next or previous vertices.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code is a collection of functions, but the main logic is in the loop that processes each test case.
   - The loop correctly initializes `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the base number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices.
   - The loop then checks for additional triangles that can be formed by consecutive vertices and boundary conditions.
   - The code does not use any of the provided functions (`func_1` to `func_25`) in the main logic, which is correct because the problem can be solved with a simple calculation and a few additional checks.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code correctly solves the problem by initializing `ans` to `x - 2` and then checking for additional triangles that can be formed.
   - The code handles the input and output as expected and correctly processes the test cases.
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the code does not solve the problem, as the code does indeed solve it correctly.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
