The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where `n` is the number of rows in `l` and `m` is the number of columns. Each element `p[i][j]` (for `1 <= i <= n` and `1 <= j <= m`) represents the sum of all elements in `l` from the top-left corner to the element `l[i-1][j-1]`. The first row and the first column of `p` are all zeros.
