Output State: **`ver` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` is a deque containing the element `ver`.**

The code sets the value of `vis[ver]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. The other variables (`ver`, `graph`, and `q`) remain unchanged.
