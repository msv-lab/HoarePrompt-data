The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`. `ver` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function also implicitly uses a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex. Additionally, it uses a parameter `vis`, which is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if the vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited.

The function returns a list of vertices that are adjacent to `ver` and have not been visited yet.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and returns a list of adjacent vertices that have not been visited.**
