Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers. It then computes a new list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the input list `T` (derived from the input line). The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is reduced to 0. The function does not return any value. **
