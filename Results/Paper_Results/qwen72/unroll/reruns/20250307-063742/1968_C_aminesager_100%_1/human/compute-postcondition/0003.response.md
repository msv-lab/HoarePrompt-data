The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `x`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
- `x` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 10^4; `n`, an integer between 2 and 500; and `x`, a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 500.**
