The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which means `t` is already non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
