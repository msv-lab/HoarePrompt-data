You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: t = 0, n = an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, x is a list of integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and the results of the loop are printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers. It then computes a new list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the input list `T` (derived from the input line). The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is reduced to 0. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the array \( a \) with a single element \( 1000 \). This is a starting point for the array \( a \).

3. **Constructing the Array \( a \):**
   - For each element \( x_i \) in the input array \( T \), the program appends \( a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) to the array \( a \).
   - This construction ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \), and \( (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array \( a \) for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) by starting with \( 1000 \) and adding values \( x_i \) which are at most \( 500 \). Therefore, \( a_i \) will always be within the valid range.
- **Modulo Condition:**
  - The condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) is satisfied because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \), and the modulo operation \( (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} \) will always yield \( x_{i-1} \).

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: \( n = 4 \), \( x = [2, 4, 1] \)
  - Program Output: \( a = [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007] \)
  - Verification:
    - \( 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 \)
    - \( 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \)
    - \( 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 \)
  - The output satisfies the conditions.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = [1, 1] \)
  - Program Output: \( a = [1000, 1001, 1002] \)
  - Verification:
    - \( 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \)
    - \( 1002 \bmod 1001 = 1 \)
  - The output satisfies the conditions.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: \( n = 6 \), \( x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2] \)
  - Program Output: \( a = [1000, 1004, 1006, 1011, 1012, 1014] \)
  - Verification:
    - \( 1004 \bmod 1000 = 4 \)
    - \( 1006 \bmod 1004 = 2 \)
    - \( 1011 \bmod 1006 = 5 \)
    - \( 1012 \bmod 1011 = 1 \)
    - \( 1014 \bmod 1012 = 2 \)
  - The output satisfies the conditions.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: \( n = 2 \), \( x = [500] \)
  - Program Output: \( a = [1000, 1500] \)
  - Verification:
    - \( 1500 \bmod 1000 = 500 \)
  - The output satisfies the conditions.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = [1, 5] \)
  - Program Output: \( a = [1000, 1001, 1006] \)
  - Verification:
    - \( 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \)
    - \( 1006 \bmod 1001 = 5 \)
  - The output satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \( a \) such that the conditions \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) and \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) are satisfied for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
