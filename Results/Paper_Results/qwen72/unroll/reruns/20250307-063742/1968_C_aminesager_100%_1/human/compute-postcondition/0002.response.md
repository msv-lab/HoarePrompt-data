Output State: **t = 0, n = an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, x is a list of integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and the results of the loop are printed for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, and each time it decrements `t` by 1. After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The variable `n` is read from input at the beginning of each iteration, so its value will be the last input value provided for `n` after the loop finishes.
- The list `x` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- For each iteration, the loop reads a line of input, processes it to create a new list `a`, and prints the result. The final output state includes the printed results for each test case.
