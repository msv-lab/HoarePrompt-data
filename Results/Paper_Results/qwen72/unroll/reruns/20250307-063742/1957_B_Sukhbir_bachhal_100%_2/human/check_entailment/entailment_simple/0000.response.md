### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`, which is correct because the only number in the sequence must be `k` itself.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning -1, but this case is not applicable since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
   - The function iterates through the bits of `k` using a right shift operation and increments a counter `position` until `k` becomes 0.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.

4. **Sequence Construction Logic:**
   - The program appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
   - It then appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The remaining `n - 2` elements are set to 0, which is valid because they do not affect the sum or the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The sequence constructed ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.
   - This is because `2 ** counter - 1` has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position, and the remaining elements are 0, which do not add any additional 1s to the bitwise OR.

### Correctness:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the sequence meets the required conditions.

**Correctness: True**
