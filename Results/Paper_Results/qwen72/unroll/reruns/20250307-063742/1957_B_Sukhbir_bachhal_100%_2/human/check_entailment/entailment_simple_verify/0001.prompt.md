You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of n, and n is 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program needs to output a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Handling Single Element Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition with a single element is to use `k` itself.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is `k`.
     - It appends `0` for the remaining `n - 2` elements.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the highest bit position set in `n`.
   - It initializes `position` to 0 and shifts `n` right until `n` becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1` to get the highest bit position (0-indexed).

### Verification:
1. **Single Element Case**:
   - For `n == 1`, the program prints `k` directly, which is correct.

2. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The sequence constructed is `[2 ** counter - 1, k - (2 ** counter - 1), 0, 0, ..., 0]`.
   - The sum of this sequence is `2 ** counter - 1 + (k - (2 ** counter - 1)) + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = k`, which satisfies the first condition.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence is `2 ** counter - 1 | (k - (2 ** counter - 1)) | 0 | 0 | ... | 0`.
     - `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`.
     - `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` is a number that, when ORed with `2 ** counter - 1`, will not change any bits that are already set to 1 in `2 ** counter - 1`.
     - Therefore, the bitwise OR of the sequence will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `k` is a power of 2**:
  - `func_1(k)` will return the highest bit position.
  - The sequence will be `[2 ** counter - 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (since `k - (2 ** counter - 1) = 1`).
  - The bitwise OR will be `2 ** counter - 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 = 2 ** counter - 1`, which has the maximum number of 1s.

- **When `k` is a small number**:
  - The sequence will still be constructed correctly, ensuring the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.
