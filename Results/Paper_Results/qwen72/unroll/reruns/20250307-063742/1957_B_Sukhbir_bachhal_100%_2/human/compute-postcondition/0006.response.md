Output State: **The program returns -1.**

In the initial state, `n` is 0, and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. The binary representation of 0 is simply "0", which has 1 bit. Therefore, `position` is 1. The code returns `position - 1`, which is 1 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1.
