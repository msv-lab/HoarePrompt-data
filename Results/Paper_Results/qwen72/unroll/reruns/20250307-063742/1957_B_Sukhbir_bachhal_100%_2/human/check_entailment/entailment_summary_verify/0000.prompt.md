You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and returns the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always construct a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed because it only considers the highest bit set in `k` and constructs the sequence in a way that may not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Counterexample:
- **Input:** `2 5`
- **Expected Output:** A sequence like `5 0` or `4 1` or `3 2`, where the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
- **Actual Output:** The program outputs `3 2`, which is correct in this case, but for another input like `3 5`, the program outputs `3 2 0`, which is not optimal.

### Optimal Solution for `3 5`:
- **Expected Output:** A sequence like `1 1 3` or `1 3 1` or `3 1 1`, where the bitwise OR of the sequence is `3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones in its binary representation.
- **Actual Output:** The program outputs `3 2 0`, where the bitwise OR of the sequence is `3` (binary `11`), but the sequence `1 1 3` would also have the same bitwise OR and is a valid solution that maximizes the number of 1s.

The program fails to consider all possible distributions of the sum `k` across the `n` integers, which can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.
