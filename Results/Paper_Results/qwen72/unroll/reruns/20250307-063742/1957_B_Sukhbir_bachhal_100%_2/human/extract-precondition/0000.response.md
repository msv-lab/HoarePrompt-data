Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include both `n` and `k` as parameters, like this:

```
def func_1(n, k):
```

Given this, the correct precondition would be:

Precondition: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
