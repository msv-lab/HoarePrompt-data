Output State: **position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of n, and n is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `position` will be the number of bits required to represent the initial value of `n` in binary form, and `n` will be 0. For example, if the initial value of `n` is 8 (which is `1000` in binary and has 4 bits), `position` will be 4 after the loop, and `n` will be 0.
