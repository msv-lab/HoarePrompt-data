The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is not equal to 0. Given the state right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0; position is 0**
