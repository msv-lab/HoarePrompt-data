### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
     - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - The remaining `n-2` elements are set to 0.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and returns the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` minus one.
   - This is achieved by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning -1, but this case is not relevant for the problem since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

4. **Sequence Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the sequence is constructed such that the first element is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The second element is the remaining value needed to reach `k`.
   - The rest of the elements are 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR.
   - This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible, as the first element already has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for all valid inputs and meets the problem requirements.
