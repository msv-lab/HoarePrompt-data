Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0; position is 0.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the given range and is not zero. The code snippet initializes a new variable `position` to 0, which is now part of the output state. No other variables are affected, so the initial state for `n` remains unchanged.
