The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, representing the total number of vertices.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, representing an additional parameter related to the vertices.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. The list of `x` integers contains distinct values from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. For each test case defined by `t`, it processes the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the total number of vertices, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` is an additional parameter. The function returns a result based on these parameters for each test case.**
