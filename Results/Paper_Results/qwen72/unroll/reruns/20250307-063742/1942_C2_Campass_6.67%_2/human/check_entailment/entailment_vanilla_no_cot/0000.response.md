Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices and additional vertices that can be chosen. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling of `val` and `y`**: The program tries to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the additional vertices can be added to form more triangles. The logic for adding `y` vertices to the list `val` is flawed. Specifically, the way it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices is not correct.

2. **Calculation of `sx`**: The variable `sx` is used to count the number of triangles, but the logic for updating `sx` is not clear and does not seem to correctly account for the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices.

3. **Final Calculation of `cons`**: The final calculation of `cons` is incorrect. The formula `x + sx - 2` does not correctly represent the number of triangles that can be formed. The correct approach should involve a more detailed geometric consideration of how adding vertices affects the number of triangles.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `y` is zero or when the vertices chosen by Bessie are already optimal.

To correctly solve this problem, a more detailed approach is needed, considering the geometric properties of the polygon and the constraints on the vertices. The program should correctly calculate the number of triangles that can be formed by the given vertices and the additional vertices, ensuring that the diagonals do not intersect and that the number of triangles is maximized.
