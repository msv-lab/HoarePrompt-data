### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are sorted and an additional vertex `n + l[0]` is appended to the list `l`. This is done to handle the cyclic nature of the polygon by treating the last vertex as if it were connected to the first vertex in a linear manner.

3. **Calculating Initial Triangles:**
   - The function initializes `sx` to 0, which will store the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `l` and calculates the number of vertices between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices. If this number is 1, it means a triangle can be formed, and `sx` is incremented.

4. **Handling Additional Vertices:**
   - The function sorts the list `val` based on a custom key: first by whether the number is even or odd, and then by the number itself.
   - It then iterates through `val` and calculates how many additional vertices can be used to form more triangles. The number of additional vertices `y` is decremented accordingly.

5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Triangles:**
   - The function calculates the total number of triangles `cons` as `x + sx - 2`.
   - It ensures that `cons` does not exceed `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `cons` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes the vertices to determine the number of triangles.
- The logic for calculating the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the additional vertices is sound.
- The function ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in the polygon.
- The use of the custom sorting key and the logic for decrementing `y` are appropriate for the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the vertices, and calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
