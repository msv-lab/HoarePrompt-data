The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the first integer read from the input, and it is given that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This means `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input, 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x. The list of `x` integers contains distinct values from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers.**
