Output State: **The loop prints the value of `cons` for each test case, which is the minimum number of connected components that can be formed in a cycle graph with `n` vertices, given the constraints of `x` chosen vertices and `y` additional edges.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are provided, along with a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices.
  - `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from the input.
    - `sx` is initialized to 0.
    - A list `l` is read, sorted, and an additional element `n + l[0]` is appended to it.
    - The differences between consecutive elements in `l` are calculated and stored in `val`.
    - `val` is sorted based on a custom key: first by whether the difference is even (1 - (difference & 1)), and then by the difference itself.
    - The loop iterates over `val` to adjust `sx` based on the values in `val` and the remaining `y` edges.
    - `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, and it is clamped to the minimum of `n - 2` and `cons`.
    - The value of `cons` is printed for each test case.

- **Output State**:
  - After the loop finishes, the output state is the sequence of printed values of `cons` for each test case.
  - Each `cons` value represents the minimum number of connected components that can be formed in a cycle graph with `n` vertices, given the constraints of `x` chosen vertices and `y` additional edges.
