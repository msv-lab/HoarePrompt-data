### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop Control:**
   - The function `func()` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The vertices are sorted and an additional vertex is appended to the list to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - `sx` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of triangular pieces that can be formed.
   - The list `l` is sorted to ensure the vertices are in a circular order.

3. **Calculating Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is 1, it means the vertices are adjacent, and a triangle can be formed directly. This is added to `sx`.
   - The gaps are stored in the list `val`.

4. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on their parity and size. This ensures that gaps are processed in a way that maximizes the number of triangles formed.

5. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to form as many triangles as possible by using the additional vertices `y`.
   - For each gap `i`, it calculates the number of additional vertices needed to form triangles (`c = i // 2`).
   - If `y` is less than `c`, it adds `y * 2` to `sx` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i` to `sx` and decreases `y` by `c`.

6. **Calculating the Final Number of Triangles:**
   - The total number of triangles that can be formed is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.
   - This value is then clamped to the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides, which is `n - 2`.

7. **Output:**
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic for calculating gaps and sorting them is sound.
- The process of forming triangles by using the additional vertices is logically consistent.
- The final clamping to `n - 2` ensures that the result does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and steps are well-structured and follow the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
