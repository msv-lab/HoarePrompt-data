Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it takes the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional edges `y`. It processes these inputs to determine the minimum number of connected components that can be formed in a cycle graph with `n` vertices, considering the constraints of `x` chosen vertices and `y` additional edges. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum number of connected components. The function does not return any value. **
