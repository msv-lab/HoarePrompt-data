#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)

    tickets_bought = 0

    #State: `tickets_bought = k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different types of tickets, `m` is the maximum number of tickets available for each type, and `prices` is a list of the prices for each type of ticket. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost is calculated based on the increasing price of tickets as more tickets are bought. After the function concludes, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
