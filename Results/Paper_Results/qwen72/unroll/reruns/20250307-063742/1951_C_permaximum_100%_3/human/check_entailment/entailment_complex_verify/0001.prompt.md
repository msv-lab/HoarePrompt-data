You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #The program returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different types of tickets, `m` is the maximum number of tickets available for each type, and `prices` is a list of the prices for each type of ticket. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost is calculated based on the increasing price of tickets as more tickets are bought. After the function concludes, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This allows it to always consider the cheapest available day for buying tickets.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which represents the cheapest day to buy tickets.
   - The price is adjusted by adding the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`), which accounts for the increase in prices due to previous ticket purchases.
   - The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - It updates the number of tickets bought and the cumulative price increase.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always buys tickets on the cheapest available day, which is a key requirement for minimizing the total cost.
  - The adjustment of prices by adding the cumulative price increase correctly accounts for the price increases due to previous purchases.
  - The program correctly handles the constraints by ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all the tickets in a single day.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is much larger than `m` by spreading the purchases over multiple days.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently finds the cheapest day to buy tickets, even when the number of days `n` is large.
  - The time complexity of the heap operations (push and pop) is \(O(\log n)\), making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient data structure to ensure optimal performance.
