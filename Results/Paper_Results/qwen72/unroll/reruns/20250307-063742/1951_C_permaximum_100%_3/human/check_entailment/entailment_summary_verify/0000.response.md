### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase` to zero. This is correct as we start with no tickets bought, no total cost, and no price increase.

2. **Heap Construction**:
   - The function constructs a min-heap from the initial ticket prices using `heapq.heapify(pq)`. This is correct because it allows us to always select the day with the lowest current ticket price efficiently.

3. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`. This ensures that we buy exactly `k` tickets, which is the goal of the problem.
   - Inside the loop, the function pops the day with the lowest current ticket price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day using `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. This ensures that we do not buy more than `m` tickets per day and that we buy exactly the remaining number of tickets needed if it is less than `m`.

4. **Price Increase**:
   - The function updates the total cost by adding `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - It updates `tickets_bought` by adding `tickets_to_buy`.
   - It increases the price for subsequent days by adding `price_increase += tickets_to_buy`. This is correct because the price increase is cumulative and should be applied to all subsequent days.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the function will purchase all tickets in a single day, which is correct.
   - If `k` is greater than `m`, the function will distribute the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the cheapest available day, which is also correct.
   - The function correctly updates the prices for subsequent days based on the tickets purchased.

### Potential Issues

- **Heap Update**: The function does not re-heapify the heap after updating the price of a day. However, since the heap is only used to find the minimum price and the price increase is applied uniformly to all subsequent days, this is not a critical issue. The heap will still provide the correct minimum price for the next purchase.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4 2 3`, `8 6 4 2`
   - Initial prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Day 1: Buy 0 tickets, prices become `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Day 2: Buy 0 tickets, prices become `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket, cost = 4, prices become `[8, 6, 5, 3]`
   - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, cost = 6, prices become `[8, 6, 5, 4]`
   - Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4 2 8`, `8 6 4 2`
   - Initial prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets, cost = 16, prices become `[10, 8, 6, 4]`
   - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets, cost = 16, prices become `[12, 10, 8, 6]`
   - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets, cost = 16, prices become `[14, 12, 10, 8]`
   - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, cost = 16, prices become `[16, 14, 12, 10]`
   - Total cost = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 100 1`, `10000 1 100 10 1000`
   - Initial prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
   - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket, cost = 1, prices become `[10001, 2, 101, 11, 1001]`
   - Total cost = 1

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `6 3 9`, `5 5 5 5 5 5`
   - Initial prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets, cost = 15, prices become `[8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets, cost = 15, prices become `[11, 11, 11, 8, 8, 8]`
   - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets, cost = 24, prices become `[14, 14, 14, 11, 11, 11]`
   - Total cost = 15 + 15 + 24 = 54

However, the expected output for the fourth example is 72, not 54. This indicates a potential issue in the function's logic.

### Correcting the Issue

The issue lies in the fact that the function does not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days. The price increase should be applied to the remaining days, not just the current day. We need to update the prices in the heap after each purchase.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Update the prices in the heap for the remaining days
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            pq[i] = (pq[i][0] + tickets_to_buy, pq[i][1])
        heapq.heapify(pq)
    return total_cost
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the function did not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days. The corrected function ensures that the price increase is applied to all remaining days, which is necessary to find the minimum spending.

Final: **False**
