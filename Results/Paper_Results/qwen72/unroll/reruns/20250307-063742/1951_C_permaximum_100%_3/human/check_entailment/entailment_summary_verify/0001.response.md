### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This allows it to always consider the cheapest available day for buying tickets.
   - The heap is initialized with tuples `(price, day)` where `price` is the ticket price and `day` is the index of the day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which represents the cheapest day to buy tickets.
   - The price is adjusted by adding the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`), which accounts for the increase in prices due to previous ticket purchases.
   - The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - It updates the number of tickets bought and the cumulative price increase.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always buys tickets on the cheapest available day, which is a key requirement for minimizing the total cost.
  - The adjustment of prices by adding the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`) correctly accounts for the price increases due to previous purchases.
  - The program correctly handles the constraints by ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all the tickets in a single day.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is much larger than `m` by spreading the purchases over multiple days.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the number of test cases `t` is large (up to \(10^4\)) and the number of days `n` is large (up to \(3 \cdot 10^5\)).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently finds the cheapest day to buy tickets, even when the number of days `n` is large.
  - The time complexity of the heap operations (push and pop) is \(O(\log n)\), making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient data structure to ensure optimal performance.

Final: **True**
