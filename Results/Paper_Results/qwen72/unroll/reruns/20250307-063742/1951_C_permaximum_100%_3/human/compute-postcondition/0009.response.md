Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different types of tickets, `m` is the maximum number of tickets available for each type, and `prices` is a list of the prices for each type of ticket. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost is calculated based on the increasing price of tickets as more tickets are bought. After the function concludes, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets. **
