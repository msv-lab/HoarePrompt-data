Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets based on the given constraints and problem description. It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current ticket price, and it accounts for the price increase due to tickets purchased on previous days. The program correctly handles the following aspects:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes the total cost and the number of tickets bought to zero and the price increase to zero.
2. **Heap Construction**: It constructs a min-heap from the initial ticket prices.
3. **Ticket Purchase Loop**: It continues to purchase tickets until the required number of tickets (k) is reached.
4. **Price Increase**: It correctly updates the price increase after each purchase.
5. **Ticket Limit per Day**: It ensures that no more than m tickets are purchased per day by using `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.

The program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. For example:
- If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it will purchase all tickets in a single day.
- If `k` is greater than `m`, it will distribute the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the cheapest available day.
- The program correctly updates the prices for subsequent days based on the tickets purchased.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
