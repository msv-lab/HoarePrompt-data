Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a daily purchase limit of `m` tickets and an increasing price per ticket for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Using a Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their corresponding days.
   - This allows the program to always consider the cheapest ticket price available.

3. **Calculating Total Cost**:
   - The program maintains a `total_cost` variable to keep track of the total spending.
   - It also maintains a `tickets_bought` variable to keep track of the number of tickets already purchased.
   - A `price_increase` variable is used to keep track of the cumulative increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

4. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program repeatedly pops the cheapest ticket price from the heap, adds the current `price_increase` to it, and buys as many tickets as possible (up to `m` tickets or the remaining number of tickets needed to reach `k`).
   - The cost of the tickets bought is added to `total_cost`, and the number of tickets bought is added to `tickets_bought`.
   - The `price_increase` is updated by the number of tickets bought.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Once the required number of tickets `k` is bought, the program returns the `total_cost`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner by always choosing the cheapest available option, taking into account the price increases due to previous purchases. This approach ensures that the solution is optimal and meets the problem requirements.
