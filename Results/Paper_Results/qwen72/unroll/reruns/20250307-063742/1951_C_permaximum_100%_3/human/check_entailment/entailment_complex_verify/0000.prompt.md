You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different types of tickets, `m` is the maximum number of tickets available for each type, and `prices` is a list of the prices for each type of ticket. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost is calculated based on the increasing price of tickets as more tickets are bought. After the function concludes, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets based on the given constraints and problem description. It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current ticket price, and it accounts for the price increase due to tickets purchased on previous days. The program correctly handles the following aspects:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes the total cost and the number of tickets bought to zero and the price increase to zero.
2. **Heap Construction**: It constructs a min-heap from the initial ticket prices.
3. **Ticket Purchase Loop**: It continues to purchase tickets until the required number of tickets (k) is reached.
4. **Price Increase**: It correctly updates the price increase after each purchase.
5. **Ticket Limit per Day**: It ensures that no more than m tickets are purchased per day by using `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.

The program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. For example:
- If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it will purchase all tickets in a single day.
- If `k` is greater than `m`, it will distribute the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the cheapest available day.
- The program correctly updates the prices for subsequent days based on the tickets purchased.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
