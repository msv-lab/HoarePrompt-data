Output State: **`tickets_bought = k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.**

### Explanation:
- **`tickets_bought = k`**: The loop continues until the number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches the desired number of tickets (`k`). Therefore, after the loop finishes, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
- **`total_cost`**: This variable accumulates the total cost of buying the tickets. Each iteration of the loop, the cost of buying a certain number of tickets (`tickets_to_buy`) at the current price (`price`) is added to `total_cost`. The price is adjusted by the `price_increase` before calculating the cost.
- **`price_increase`**: This variable keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far. It is incremented by the number of tickets bought in each iteration (`tickets_to_buy`). After the loop finishes, `price_increase` will be equal to `k`, the total number of tickets bought.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The heap `pq` will be modified during the loop execution, but since it is not part of the loop head or body, it is not included in the output state.
