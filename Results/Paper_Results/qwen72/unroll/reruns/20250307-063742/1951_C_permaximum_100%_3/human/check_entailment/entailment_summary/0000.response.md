Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints on the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) and the price increases after each purchase. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, which is a good approach to minimize the total cost.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Heap Management**: The program does not re-heapify the prices after a purchase. When tickets are bought on a certain day, the price for that day increases, but the program does not push the updated price back into the heap. This means that the heap might not always contain the correct prices, leading to incorrect decisions in subsequent iterations.

2. **Day Indexing**: The program uses the day index in the heap, but it does not utilize it correctly. The day index is not necessary for the logic of the program and can be removed to simplify the code.

3. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increase is applied globally to all days, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the program should ensure that the updated prices are correctly managed in the heap.

To fix these issues, the program should re-heapify the prices after each purchase by pushing the updated price back into the heap. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Push the updated price back into the heap
        if tickets_to_buy < m:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (price + tickets_to_buy, day))
    return total_cost
```

With these changes, the program will correctly manage the heap and ensure that the prices are updated after each purchase, leading to the correct minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**  
The original program does not correctly manage the heap after each purchase, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected version should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
