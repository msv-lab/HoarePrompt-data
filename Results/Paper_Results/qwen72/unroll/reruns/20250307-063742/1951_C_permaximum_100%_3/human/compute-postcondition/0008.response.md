The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of different types of tickets.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the number of tickets available for each type.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, representing the prices of the different types of tickets.

The function returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different types of tickets, `m` is the number of tickets available for each type, and `prices` is a list of the prices for each type of ticket.**
