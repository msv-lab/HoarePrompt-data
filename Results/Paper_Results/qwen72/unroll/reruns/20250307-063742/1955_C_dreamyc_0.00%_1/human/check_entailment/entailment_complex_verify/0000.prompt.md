You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans` incremented by 1, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. Since `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the program returns `ans + 1`, which is 2.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. Additionally, either `k` is not an even number, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted to 0 during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted during the loop. In all other cases, the function returns `ans`. The elements in `nums` are modified during the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the total durability of the first and last ships combined. In such a case, the program should continue to attack the ships until `k` is exhausted, but it breaks out of the loop prematurely. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this example, the Kraken attacks the first ship (reducing its durability from 1 to 0), then the last ship (reducing its durability from 3 to 2), and then the first ship again (which is now the second ship in the list, reducing its durability from 2 to 1). After 3 attacks, only one ship should have sunk, but the program incorrectly returns 0.
