You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted to 0 during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted during the loop. In all other cases, the function returns `ans`. The elements in `nums` are modified during the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The program uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships' durabilities. This is appropriate because `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program enters a `while` loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the `deque`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces the durabilities of both ships by `x` and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the remaining attacks are not enough to fully sink both ships.

4. **Ship Durability Check**:
   - After reducing the durabilities, it checks if the first ship (`a`) still has positive durability. If so, it appends it back to the `deque`. If not, it increments the `ans` (number of sunk ships).
   - Similarly, it checks the last ship (`b`). If it still has positive durability, it appends it back to the `deque`. If not, it increments the `ans`.

5. **Single Ship Handling**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), the program checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **All Ships Sunk**:
  - If all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are exhausted, the program correctly stops and prints the number of sunk ships.
- **No Ships Sunk**:
  - If `k` is not enough to sink any ship, the program correctly prints 0.
- **Single Ship Remaining**:
  - If only one ship remains and `k` is enough to sink it, the program correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
