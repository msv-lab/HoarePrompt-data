Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a deque to efficiently manage the ships being attacked from both ends. The program processes each test case by:

1. Reading the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
2. Reading the durability of each ship into a deque.
3. Using a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks, alternating between the first and last ship.
4. Reducing the durability of the ships and counting how many ships sink.
5. Handling the case where only one ship remains and the Kraken still has attacks left.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the Kraken attacks a single remaining ship, and it ensures that the ships are only attacked if they haven't sunk yet. The output for each test case is the number of ships that were sunk, which matches the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
