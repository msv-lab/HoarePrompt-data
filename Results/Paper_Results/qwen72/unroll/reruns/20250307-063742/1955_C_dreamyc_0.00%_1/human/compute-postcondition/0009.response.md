Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted to 0 during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted during the loop. In all other cases, the function returns `ans`. The elements in `nums` are modified during the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. **
