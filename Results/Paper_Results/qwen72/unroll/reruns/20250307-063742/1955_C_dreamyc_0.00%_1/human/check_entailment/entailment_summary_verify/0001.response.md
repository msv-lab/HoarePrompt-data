### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The program uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships' durabilities. This is appropriate because `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program enters a `while` loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the `deque`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces the durabilities of both ships by `x` and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the remaining attacks are not enough to fully sink both ships.

4. **Ship Durability Check**:
   - After reducing the durabilities, it checks if the first ship (`a`) still has positive durability. If so, it appends it back to the `deque`. If not, it increments the `ans` (number of sunk ships).
   - Similarly, it checks the last ship (`b`). If it still has positive durability, it appends it back to the `deque`. If not, it increments the `ans`.

5. **Single Ship Handling**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), the program checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **All Ships Sunk**:
  - If all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are exhausted, the program correctly stops and prints the number of sunk ships.
- **No Ships Sunk**:
  - If `k` is not enough to sink any ship, the program correctly prints 0.
- **Single Ship Remaining**:
  - If only one ship remains and `k` is enough to sink it, the program correctly handles this case.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the main logic of the problem.
- It uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships' durabilities.
- The loop correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and updates the durabilities and the number of remaining attacks.
- The function correctly handles the case where only one ship remains and checks if the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
