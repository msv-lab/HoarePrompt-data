Reasoning:

The program aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships and count how many ships sink. The key points to consider for correctness are:

1. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one independently.
2. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input values for `n` and `k` and the list of ship durabilities `nums` correctly.
3. **Using Deque for Efficient Operations**: The program uses a deque to efficiently perform operations on both ends of the list of ship durabilities, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.
4. **Main Loop for Kraken Attacks**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are at least two ships left and the Kraken still has attacks remaining.
   - It correctly identifies the first and last ships, reduces their durabilities, and updates `k` accordingly.
   - It handles the case where the Kraken can attack both ships in a single iteration by reducing their durabilities by the minimum of the two.
   - It correctly appends the remaining durability of the ships back to the deque if they are still above 0.
   - It increments the `ans` counter for each ship that sinks.
5. **Final Check for Single Remaining Ship**:
   - If there is exactly one ship left and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it, the program correctly increments `ans` by 1 and returns the result.
   - If there are no more attacks or the remaining ship cannot be sunk, the program returns the current value of `ans`.

The program's logic and implementation align with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately. The use of `deque` ensures that the operations are efficient, and the loop and final check are correctly structured to simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
