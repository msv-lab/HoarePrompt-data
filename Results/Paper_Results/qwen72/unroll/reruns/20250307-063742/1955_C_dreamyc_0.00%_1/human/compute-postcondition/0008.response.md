The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `k` is a positive integer where `1 <= k <= 10^15`. `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, each satisfying `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

The function returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns 2 (since `ans` is incremented by 1 and then 1 is added to `ans`).
