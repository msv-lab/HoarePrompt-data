Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
