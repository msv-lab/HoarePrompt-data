Output State: **The program returns `ans` incremented by 1, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. Since `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the program returns `ans + 1`, which is 2.**
