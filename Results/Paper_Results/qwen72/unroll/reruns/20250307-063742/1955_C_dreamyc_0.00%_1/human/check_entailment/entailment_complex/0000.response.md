### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function converts `nums` to a deque to efficiently pop elements from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The main loop runs as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left in `nums`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` (`x`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces both `a` and `b` by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` is still greater than 0, it appends `a` back to the left of the deque; otherwise, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If `b` is still greater than 0, it appends `b` back to the right of the deque; otherwise, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining ship's durability, it increments `ans` by 1 and returns `ans + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Main Loop:**
  - The loop correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships.
  - It ensures that the ships are only attacked as long as they have positive durability.
  - The use of `min(a, b)` ensures that the Kraken attacks the ships in a balanced manner, reducing both ships by the same amount until one of them sinks.

- **Handling the Last Ship:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship remains and the Kraken still has attacks left.
  - It increments `ans` by 1 if the remaining ship is sunk by the Kraken.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the Kraken's attacks are simulated accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
