You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. nums is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans` incremented by 1, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. Since `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the program returns `ans + 1`, which is 2.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. Additionally, either `k` is not an even number, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted to 0 during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `ans` incremented by 1, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. Since `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the program returns `ans + 1`, which is 2.

Case_2: The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
