#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. nums is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans` incremented by 1, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. Since `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the program returns `ans + 1`, which is 2.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. Additionally, either `k` is not an even number, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that were completely subtracted to 0 during the loop. If `nums` contains exactly one element and `k` is greater than or equal to this element, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely subtracted during the loop. In all other cases, the function returns `ans`. The elements in `nums` are modified during the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced.
