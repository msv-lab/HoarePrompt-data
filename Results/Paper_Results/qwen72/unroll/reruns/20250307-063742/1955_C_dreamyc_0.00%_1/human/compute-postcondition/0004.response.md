Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. Additionally, `k` is a non-zero value, `nums` has exactly one element, and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
