Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even amount that can be subtracted in each iteration until `k` is less than twice the minimum value of the two elements being considered, or until `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely subtracted (i.e., reduced to 0) during the loop. The elements in `nums` are modified by the loop, with some elements possibly being removed or reduced. Additionally, either `k` is not an even number, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]`.**
