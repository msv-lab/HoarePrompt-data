### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - **Purpose**: The function `func_1` transforms the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - **Correctness**:
     - **Set Conversion**: Converting the list `a` to a set removes duplicates, which is correct because the game only cares about unique pile sizes.
     - **Sorting**: Sorting the set ensures that the smallest pile sizes are considered first, which is essential for the game's rules.
     - **Difference Calculation**: The loop calculates the difference between consecutive elements, which helps in understanding the structure of the game. The first element remains unchanged, which is correct because it represents the smallest unique pile size.
   - **Output**: The function returns a list `a_new` where each element (except the first) is the difference between consecutive unique elements in the sorted list. This transformation is crucial for the recursive logic in `func_2`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes and the number of piles.
   - **Correctness**:
     - **Base Case 1**: If `n == 1`, Alice wins. This is correct because Alice can always remove all stones from the single pile.
     - **Base Case 2**: If `n == 2`, Alice wins if the smallest pile has an even number of stones. This is correct because Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move if the smallest pile is even. If the smallest pile is odd, Alice will be forced to leave at least one stone in the other pile, and Bob can then win by removing the remaining stones.
     - **Recursive Case**: For `n > 2`, the function recursively checks the winner by removing the smallest pile and checking the remaining piles.
       - **Recursive Call**: `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` correctly reduces the problem to the remaining piles.
       - **Decision Logic**:
         - If `winNext == 2`, Alice wins because Bob will lose in the next turn.
         - If `winNext == 1` and `a[0] != 1`, Alice wins because she can remove a non-1 smallest pile and force Bob into a losing position.
         - Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Output**: The function returns 1 if Alice wins and 2 if Bob wins, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

3. **Main Program**
   - **Input Handling**: The main program correctly reads the number of test cases and the pile sizes for each test case.
   - **Transformation**: It calls `func_1` to transform the pile sizes, which is necessary for the recursive logic in `func_2`.
   - **Winner Determination**: It calls `func_2` with the transformed list and the number of piles, and prints the winner based on the returned value.
   - **Output**: The output is correctly formatted as "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The base cases and recursive logic are sound, and the transformation in `func_1` ensures that the recursive function `func_2` can make the correct decisions.

Final: **True**
