Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the number of piles and the distribution of stones do not align with the logic implemented in `func_2`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
2 2 2
```
The correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 2 \) on her first turn, which will empty all piles at once, and Bob will be unable to make a move. However, the program will output "Bob" because it does not correctly handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones and that number is even.

The issue lies in the recursive function `func_2`, which does not correctly account for the optimal play strategy when all piles have the same number of stones. The function `func_1` is also not used in the final determination of the winner, which suggests that the program is incomplete or incorrect in its logic.
