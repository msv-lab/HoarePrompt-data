### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves removing a positive integer \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function transforms the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Convert the list `a` to a set to remove duplicates.
     2. Sort the set and convert it back to a list `a_new`.
     3. Create a copy of `a_new` called `a_temp`.
     4. For each element in `a_new` starting from the second element, subtract the previous element in `a_temp` from it.
     5. Return the modified list `a_new`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The transformation is correct because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the focus is on the differences between pile sizes.
     - This transformation helps in understanding the game dynamics, especially for recursive calls.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes and the number of piles.
   - **Steps**:
     1. If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
     2. If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the smallest pile has an even number of stones, otherwise Bob wins.
     3. For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the winner of the game if the smallest pile is removed (`a[1:]` and `n - 1`).
     4. If the recursive call returns that the next player (Bob) will lose (`winNext == 2`), or if the next player will win but the smallest pile is not 1 (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`), then Alice wins.
     5. Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Correctness**:
     - **Base Cases**:
       - For `n == 1`, Alice always wins because she can remove all stones from the single pile.
       - For `n == 2`, Alice wins if the smallest pile has an even number of stones. This is correct because if the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move. If the smallest pile has an odd number of stones, Alice will be forced to leave at least one stone in the other pile, and Bob can then win by removing the remaining stones.
     - **Recursive Case**:
       - The function correctly handles the recursive case by removing the smallest pile and checking the remaining piles.
       - The logic for determining the winner based on the recursive call is sound. If the next player (Bob) will lose, Alice wins. If the next player will win but the smallest pile is not 1, Alice can still win by removing a non-1 smallest pile and forcing Bob into a losing position.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to transform the list of pile sizes.
   - It then calls `func_2` to determine the winner based on the transformed list.
   - The program prints "Alice" if the winner is 1, and "Bob" if the winner is 2.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The base cases and recursive logic are sound, and the transformation in `func_1` ensures that the recursive function `func_2` can make the correct decisions.

Final: **True**
