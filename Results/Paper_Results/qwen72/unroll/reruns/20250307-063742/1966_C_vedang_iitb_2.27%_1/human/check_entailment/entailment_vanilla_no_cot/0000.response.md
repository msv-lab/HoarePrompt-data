Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function transforms the input array `a` by sorting it and then computing the differences between consecutive elements. The result is a new array where each element represents the difference between the current and the previous element in the sorted unique set of the original array.
   - While this transformation might be useful for some problems, it does not directly help in determining the winner of the game described. The game involves removing the same number of stones from all nonempty piles, and the transformation performed by `func_1` does not capture the essence of the game's rules.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function attempts to determine the winner by recursively checking the state of the game after removing the smallest pile.
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are incorrect:
     - For `n == 1`, the function returns `1`, which means Alice wins. This is correct because Alice can always remove the single pile.
     - For `n == 2`, the function checks if the smallest pile size is even. If it is, it returns `1` (Alice wins), otherwise it returns `2` (Bob wins). This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the smallest pile size, not just the smallest pile itself.
   - The recursive case is also flawed. The function calls itself with the remaining piles after removing the smallest pile, but it does not correctly handle the game's rules. Specifically, it does not consider the optimal play for both players, and the logic for determining the winner based on the recursive call is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, you need to consider the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins. This is because each move reduces the number of stones in all nonempty piles by the same amount, and the game ends when all piles are empty. The key observation is that the parity of the number of odd piles determines the winner.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        a = test_cases[_][1]
        odd_piles = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 1)
        if odd_piles % 2 == 1:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of odd piles.
