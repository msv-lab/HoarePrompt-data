The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and 10^9. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).

The function returns an integer value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The program returns 1.
- Case_2: The program returns the integer 1.
- Case_3: The program returns the integer 2.
- Case_4: The program returns 1.
- Case_5: The program returns 2.

Since the cases are not mutually exclusive and all return either 1 or 2, the overall functionality can be summarized as follows:
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n`, and returns either 1 or 2.**
