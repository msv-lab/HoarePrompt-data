Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(a). `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= len(a), and n is not equal to 2. `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. `winNext` is not 2, and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1.**
