### Reasoning:

1. **func_1**:
   - This function processes the list `a` by first sorting and removing duplicates, resulting in a list of unique, sorted values.
   - It then computes the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted list, storing these differences in `a_new`.
   - The purpose of this transformation is to simplify the problem by reducing the piles to their essential differences. This is a key step in determining the game's outcome, as it helps in identifying the smallest nonempty pile and the optimal moves.

2. **func_2**:
   - This function recursively determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a` and the number of elements `n`.
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can always remove the single pile.
     - If `n` is 2, the game's outcome depends on whether the first element of `a` is even or odd. If it's even, Alice can always choose a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of stones, making Bob lose. If it's odd, Bob can always win by removing the smallest possible number of stones.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively evaluates the game by considering the subgame starting from the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1:]`).
     - If the recursive call returns 2 (indicating that Bob would win the subgame), Alice can win by making a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
     - If the recursive call returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, Alice can still win by making a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Analysis:
- The transformation in `func_1` is crucial for simplifying the problem. By reducing the piles to their essential differences, the function helps in identifying the smallest nonempty pile and the optimal moves.
- The recursive logic in `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case, ensuring that the game is evaluated optimally for both players.
- The program's overall structure and logic align with the problem description and the provided examples.

The program is correct and meets the problem description.
