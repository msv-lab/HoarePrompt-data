Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(a). `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= len(a), and n is not equal to 2. `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The value of `winNext` is either 2, or `winNext` is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1.**
