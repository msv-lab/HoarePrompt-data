### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function processes the list of pile sizes to create a new list where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Convert the list `a` to a set to remove duplicates.
     2. Sort the set and convert it back to a list `a_new`.
     3. Create a copy of `a_new` called `a_temp`.
     4. For each element in `a_new` starting from the second element, subtract the previous element in `a_temp` from it.
     5. Return the modified list `a_new`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The transformation is correct. By sorting and removing duplicates, we ensure that the smallest nonempty pile is always the first element in the list.
     - The differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list help in understanding the structure of the game, which is crucial for the recursive function `func_2`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes and the number of piles.
   - **Steps**:
     1. If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
     2. If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the smallest pile has an even number of stones, otherwise Bob wins.
     3. For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the winner of the game if the smallest pile is removed (`a[1:]` and `n - 1`).
     4. If the recursive call returns that the next player (Bob) will lose (`winNext == 2`), or if the next player will win but the smallest pile is not 1 (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`), then Alice wins.
     5. Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Correctness**:
     - **Base Case 1**: For `n == 1`, Alice always wins. This is correct because she can remove all stones from the single pile.
     - **Base Case 2**: For `n == 2`, the logic is correct. If the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move, winning the game. If the smallest pile has an odd number of stones, Alice will be forced to leave at least one stone in the other pile, and Bob can then win by removing the remaining stones.
     - **Recursive Case**: The recursive logic is sound. By removing the smallest pile and checking the remaining piles, the function correctly determines the winner. If the next player (Bob) will lose, Alice wins. If the next player will win but the smallest pile is not 1, Alice can still win by removing a non-1 smallest pile and forcing Bob into a losing position.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` ensures that the program correctly handles the game logic.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is essential for the recursive function `func_2` to make the correct decisions.
   - The program correctly handles the base cases and the recursive cases, ensuring that it determines the winner optimally.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The base cases and recursive logic are sound, and the transformation in `func_1` ensures that the recursive function `func_2` can make the correct decisions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
