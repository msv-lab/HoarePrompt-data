### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of positive integers and returns a new list `a_new` where:
     - The first element of `a_new` is the smallest unique element from `a`.
     - Each subsequent element is the difference between consecutive unique elements from `a` when sorted.
   - This transformation is useful because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between the piles are considered. This helps in understanding the game dynamics more clearly.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a` and the number of unique piles `n`.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can always choose `k` equal to the single pile's size and empty it.
     - If `n` is 2, the winner depends on the parity of the first element in the transformed list:
       - If the first element is even, Alice wins because she can choose `k` such that the second pile is left with an odd number, forcing Bob to lose.
       - If the first element is odd, Bob wins because Alice will always leave an even number in the second pile, and Bob can then choose `k` to win.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively evaluates the list `a[1:]` (i.e., the list excluding the first element) with `n-1` piles.
     - If the recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob wins the subgame), Alice wins the current game.
     - If the recursive call returns 1 (indicating Alice wins the subgame) and the first element of `a` is not 1, Alice wins the current game.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins the current game.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
   - It then applies `func_1` to transform the list `a` into a new list `a_new`.
   - The transformed list `a_new` is then passed to `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The result is printed based on the return value of `func_2`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` correctly reduces the problem to a simpler form by considering the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - The base cases in `func_2` are correctly identified and handled.
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` correctly evaluates the game state based on the transformed list and the number of unique piles.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Therefore, the program is correct.
