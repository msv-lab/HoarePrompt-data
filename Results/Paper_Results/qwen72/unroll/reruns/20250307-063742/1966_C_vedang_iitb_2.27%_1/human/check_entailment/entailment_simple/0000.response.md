### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a positive integer `k` from each nonempty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `a` of positive integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts the list and removes duplicates to get a new list `a_new`.
   - It then modifies `a_new` such that each element (except the first) is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list.
   - The purpose of this transformation is to simplify the problem by reducing the piles to their essential differences. This helps in determining the winning strategy.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes the transformed list `a` and its length `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can always remove the single pile.
   - If `n` is 2, the game's outcome depends on whether the first element is even or odd. If it's even, Alice wins; if it's odd, Bob wins.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed. If the recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob would win the next turn), or if it returns 1 and the first element of the list is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial for simplifying the problem. By converting the list to differences, it effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the game can be analyzed more easily.
   - The base cases in `func_2` are correctly handled:
     - If there is only one pile, Alice wins.
     - If there are two piles, the parity of the first element determines the winner.
   - The recursive case in `func_2` is also correct. It correctly checks the outcome of the game after removing the first pile and uses the result to determine the current player's win condition.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one pile or when there are two piles with specific parities.
   - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the recursive calls in `func_2` are made on a simplified and valid list.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description and the provided test cases. The logic and the recursive approach are sound.
