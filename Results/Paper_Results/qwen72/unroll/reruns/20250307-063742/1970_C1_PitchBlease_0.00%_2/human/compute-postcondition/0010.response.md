The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and each tuple represents an edge in the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game. The function returns either the string 'Ron' or the string 'Hermione' based on the game's outcome.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' in one case and 'Hermione' in another case, based on the game's rules and the structure of the tree defined by `n` and `edges`, starting from node `start`.**
