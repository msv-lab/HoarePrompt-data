The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in a tree, with the constraint that 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or list of lists, where each node has at least one neighbor, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `start` and `target`, representing node indices in a tree, and returns -1.**
