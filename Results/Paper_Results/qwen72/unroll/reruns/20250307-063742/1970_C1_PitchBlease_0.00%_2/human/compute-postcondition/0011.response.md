Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree from the edges, identifies the leaves of the tree, and performs breadth-first searches (BFS) from the starting node to the first two leaves. The function returns 'Ron' if the distance from the starting node to either of the first two leaves is even, and 'Hermione' otherwise. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
