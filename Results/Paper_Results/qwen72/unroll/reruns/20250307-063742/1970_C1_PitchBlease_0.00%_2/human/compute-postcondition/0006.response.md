Functionality: ** The function `bfs` accepts two integers `start` and `target`, representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, the function returns the distance (number of edges) between the `start` and `target` nodes. If the `target` node is not found, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input tree. **
