Output State: **The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all the nodes that were visited during the search, and the loop returns the shortest distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `target` node.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `queue`.
- During each iteration, the loop dequeues a tuple `(current, dist)` from the `queue`.
- If `current` is equal to `target`, the loop returns the distance `dist`.
- Otherwise, the loop iterates over the neighbors of `current`. If a neighbor has not been visited, it is added to the `visited` set and a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to the `queue`.
- This process continues until either the `target` node is found or the `queue` is empty.
- If the `target` node is found, the loop returns the distance `dist` at that point.
- If the `target` node is not found, the `queue` will eventually become empty, and the loop will terminate without returning a distance. However, in the context of the problem, the tree has exactly two leaves, and every node is reachable, so the `target` node will always be found.
