### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a tree using a `defaultdict` of lists. This is a standard way to represent a graph in Python, where each node points to a list of its neighbors.
   - The tree is constructed correctly by iterating over the edges and adding each node to the neighbor list of the other node.

2. **Leaf Identification**:
   - The function identifies the leaves of the tree by finding nodes with only one neighbor. This is correct because a leaf node in a tree has exactly one edge connecting it to the rest of the tree.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The `bfs` function is used to find the shortest path from the starting node to each of the two leaves. It uses a queue to explore the tree level by level, which is the correct approach for BFS.
   - The function correctly returns the distance to the target node if it is found, and -1 if it is not found. However, in the context of this problem, the target node (a leaf) is guaranteed to be found, so the -1 case is not relevant.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The function `func_1` determines the winner based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves.
   - If either distance is even, Ron wins. This is because Ron makes the first move, and if the distance to either leaf is even, he can always force the game to end on an even turn, ensuring he makes the last move.
   - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins. This is because the game will end on an odd turn, and Hermione will make the last move.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is correctly parsed and the output is correctly formatted as either "Ron" or "Hermione".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The BFS function is used appropriately to find the distances to the leaves, and the winning condition is correctly applied.

Correctness: **True**
