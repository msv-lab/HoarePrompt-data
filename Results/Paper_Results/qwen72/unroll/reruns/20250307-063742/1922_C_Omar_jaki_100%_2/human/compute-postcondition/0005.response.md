Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a` and a series of queries. It then calculates and prints the difference in values from a list `b` for each query. The list `b` is constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, with additional boundary values added to `a`. After processing all queries for a test case, it moves to the next test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results of the queries. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a` has additional boundary values, and `b` contains the calculated values for the current test case. **
