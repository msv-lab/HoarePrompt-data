Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where each x_i and y_i is an integer (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
