The code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function `r` is now available for use in the program. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` are not directly modified by this code, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), `queries` is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where each x_i and y_i is an integer (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a function that maps input to integers.**
