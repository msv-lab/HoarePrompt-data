The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n`: an integer representing the number of cities (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `a`: a list of n integers representing the positions of the cities (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9).
- `m`: an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5).
- `queries`: a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where each x_i and y_i is an integer (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i).

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the closest city to the city specified by the query. If the closest city is uniquely determined, the function returns the index of that city. If there are multiple closest cities, the function returns the one with the smallest index.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries`. It returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the index of the closest city to the city specified by the query. If the closest city is uniquely determined, it returns the index of that city. If there are multiple closest cities, it returns the one with the smallest index.**
