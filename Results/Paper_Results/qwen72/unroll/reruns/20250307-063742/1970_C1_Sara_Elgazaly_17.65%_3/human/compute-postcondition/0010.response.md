Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input describing a tree with `n` nodes (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and exactly two leaves, and a starting node for a stone (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). It then simulates a process where the stone moves between nodes based on the tree's structure. The function does not return any value but prints either 'Hermione' or 'Ron' based on the final position of the stone after the process completes. The final state of the program is that the tree structure is modified (specifically, the adjacency lists are emptied), and the stone's position is determined, leading to the print statement. **
