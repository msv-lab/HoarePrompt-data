Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `lst` will contain a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree, and the value is a list of nodes that are connected to the key node. The lists will have the neighbors of each node as specified by the input pairs (a, b). The variables `x` and `y` will remain unchanged.**
