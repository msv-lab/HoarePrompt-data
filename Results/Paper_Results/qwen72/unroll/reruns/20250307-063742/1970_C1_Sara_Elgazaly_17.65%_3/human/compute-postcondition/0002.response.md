To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `x` must be greater than 1. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state before the loop (such as `func`, `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, and `lst`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `_` is 0**
