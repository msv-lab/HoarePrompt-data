### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and constructs the tree using a dictionary of lists (`lst`).
   - The input format is adhered to, and the tree is represented as an adjacency list.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `s` to `True`, which is used to alternate between Ron and Hermione.
   - The outer `while` loop continues as long as the node `x` has neighbors in the adjacency list.
   - The inner `while` loop iterates over the neighbors of the current node `x`. If a neighbor `y` has neighbors (i.e., it is not a leaf), the stone is moved to that neighbor, and `x` is updated to `y`.
   - The boolean variable `s` is toggled each time a move is made, effectively alternating between Ron and Hermione.

3. **Final Move and Output**:
   - After the stone cannot move to any more nodes (i.e., `lst[x]` is empty), the function toggles `s` one last time to account for the final move.
   - The function then prints "Hermione" if `s` is `True` (indicating Hermione's turn) or "Ron" if `s` is `False` (indicating Ron's turn).

4. **Edge Cases and Tree Structure**:
   - The problem guarantees that the tree has exactly two leaves, which means the tree can be seen as an array-like structure.
   - The function correctly simulates the game by moving the stone from one node to another until no valid moves are left.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided examples are correctly handled by the function:
     - For the input `3 1` with edges `2 3` and `3 1`, and starting node `3`, the function correctly outputs "Ron".
     - For the input `5 1` with edges `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`, and `4 5`, and starting node `5`, the function correctly outputs "Hermione".

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given tree structure and starting node. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and handle the provided examples correctly.

**Correctness: True**
