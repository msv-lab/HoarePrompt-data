The function `func` does not take any parameters, but it operates under the assumption that the input is provided externally. This input consists of a tree with `n` nodes (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`) and exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single round (t=1) where a stone is initially placed on a node (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n).

The function returns the final position of the stone after the round is completed.
