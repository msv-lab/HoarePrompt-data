Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves. According to the problem description, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the game is played on this tree. If the stone starts on one of the leaves, the player who starts (Ron) will lose immediately because there are no inactive neighbors to move to. However, the current implementation does not account for this specific edge case and will incorrectly determine the winner in such scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
In this case, the tree has nodes 1, 2, and 3, with edges between 2-3 and 3-1. Node 1 is a leaf. The program will incorrectly output "Ron" when it should output "Hermione" because Ron cannot make a move from node 1.
