Based on the initial state provided:

- `lst` is a dictionary with keys 1, 2, 3, and 4, and each key maps to an empty list.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 1.
- `s` is `False`.

The print statement is:
```
print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')
```

This statement uses a conditional expression to determine what to print. The expression checks the value of `s`:
- If `s` is `True`, it will print `'Hermione'`.
- If `s` is `False`, it will print `'Ron'`.

Since `s` is `False` in the initial state, the expression `'Hermione' if s else 'Ron'` will evaluate to `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
