Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u through an edge in the `edges` list. `n`, `edges`, and `start` variables remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in `tree`. `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves`. `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd.**
