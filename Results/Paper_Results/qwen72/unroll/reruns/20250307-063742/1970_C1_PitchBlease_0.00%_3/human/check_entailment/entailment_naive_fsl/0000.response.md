Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves. In this case, the player who starts (Ron) cannot make a move and loses immediately. However, the current implementation will still compute distances and incorrectly determine the winner based on those distances. For example, if the input is:

```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```

The output should be "Hermione" because Ron starts on a leaf and cannot make a move. However, the program will return "Ron" because it incorrectly computes the distances and does not account for this edge case.
