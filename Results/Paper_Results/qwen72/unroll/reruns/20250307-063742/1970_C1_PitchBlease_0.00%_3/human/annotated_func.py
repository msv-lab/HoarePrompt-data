#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u through an edge in the `edges` list. The `n`, `edges`, and `start` variables remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves found. If the distance to either of these leaves is even, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The input variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing the nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from `start` and were explored during the loop execution. If `target` was found, the loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop will terminate without returning, and `dist` will hold the distance of the last node processed before the queue became empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two integers, `start` and `target`, representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, the function returns the distance (number of edges) between the `start` and `target` nodes. If the `target` node is not found, the function returns -1. After the function concludes, the `queue` will be empty, and the `visited` set will contain all the nodes that were reachable from the `start` node and were explored during the search.
