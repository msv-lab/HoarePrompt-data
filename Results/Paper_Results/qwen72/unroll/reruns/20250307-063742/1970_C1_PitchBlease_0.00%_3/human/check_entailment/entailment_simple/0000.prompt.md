Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Program:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):

    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u through an edge in the `edges` list. The `n`, `edges`, and `start` variables remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing the nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from `start` and were explored during the loop execution. If `target` was found, the loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop will terminate without returning, and `dist` will hold the distance of the last node processed before the queue became empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
