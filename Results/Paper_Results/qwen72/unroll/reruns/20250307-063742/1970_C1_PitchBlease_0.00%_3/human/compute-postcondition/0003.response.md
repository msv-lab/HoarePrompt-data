Output State: **The `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from `start` and were explored during the loop execution. If `target` was found, the loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop will terminate without returning, and `dist` will hold the distance of the last node processed before the queue became empty.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes that were reachable from `start` have been processed. The `visited` set will contain all the nodes that were explored during the loop, starting from `start`. If the `target` node was found, the loop will have returned the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node was not found, the loop will simply terminate, and the `dist` variable will hold the distance of the last node that was processed before the queue became empty.
