The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes. `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v, with 1 <= u, v <= n. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node.

The function returns different strings based on the input:
- Case_1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the string 'Ron'.
- Case_2: If other conditions are met, the function returns the string 'Hermione'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It returns 'Ron' in one set of conditions and 'Hermione' in another set of conditions.**
