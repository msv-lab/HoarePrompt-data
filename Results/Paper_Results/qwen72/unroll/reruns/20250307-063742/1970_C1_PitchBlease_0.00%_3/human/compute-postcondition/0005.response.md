The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in a tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list, where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices. The function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing nodes in a tree and returns -1.**
