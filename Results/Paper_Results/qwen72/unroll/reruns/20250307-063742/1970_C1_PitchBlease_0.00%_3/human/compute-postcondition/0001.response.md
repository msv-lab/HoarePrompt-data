Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing the nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

The initial state remains the same, but now the `visited` set has been initialized to contain the integer `start`.
