### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at positions `PB` and `PS` respectively.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions the player visits.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` for their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

3. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`):**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach each position.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player revisits a position), it calculates the score for the remaining steps by identifying the cycle length and the score within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

4. **Function 3 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read in a single batch and split into a list of integers.
   - The indices are correctly managed to parse the input for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same or different.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10^9\).
  - `PB` and `PS` are integers such that \(1 \le PB, PS \le n\).
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of 1 to `n`.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) is such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both `PB` and `PS`.
  - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result.
  - The function is correct.

- **Function 2 (`calculate_score`):**
  - The function correctly initializes `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, and `visited`.
  - It iterates through the steps, updating the score and tracking visited positions.
  - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and the score within the cycle.
  - It then calculates the remaining steps and updates the score accordingly.
  - The function is correct.

- **Function 3 (`func_2`):**
  - The function reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.
  - The function is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem as described, including cycle detection and efficient score calculation for large values of `k`. The input and output handling is also correct.

Final: **True**
