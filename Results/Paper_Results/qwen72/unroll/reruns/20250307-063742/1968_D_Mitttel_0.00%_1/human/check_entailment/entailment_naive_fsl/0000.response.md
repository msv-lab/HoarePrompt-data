Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the described "Permutation game" for all potential cases. The `func_1` function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the movement and scoring, including the detection of cycles and the calculation of scores for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the game is played according to the problem description. The program follows the rules for each turn and correctly determines the winner or if the game is a draw. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
