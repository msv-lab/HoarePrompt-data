You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):

    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

#Function 2:
def calculate_score(start_pos):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]

        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score

#Function 3:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n

        results.append(result)
    for result in results:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters, and calls `func_1` for each set. It collects the results of these calls into a list and prints each result. After the function concludes, `index` is set to 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` is the number of test cases, and `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding test case. The input data remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the described "Permutation game" for all potential cases. The `func_1` function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the movement and scoring, including the detection of cycles and the calculation of scores for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the game is played according to the problem description. The program follows the rules for each turn and correctly determines the winner or if the game is a draw. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
