Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning for each function and the overall correctness of the program:

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`
- **Input**: `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `PB` (Bodya's starting position), `PS` (Sasha's starting position), `p` (permutation list), `a` (score array).
- **Behavior**:
  - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
  - It compares the scores and returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if they are equal.
- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly calls `calculate_score` with the appropriate starting positions.
  - The comparison logic is straightforward and correct.

### Function 2: `calculate_score(start_pos)`
- **Input**: `start_pos` (starting position of the player).
- **Behavior**:
  - It initializes `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, and `cycle_start`.
  - It iterates through the permutation `p` for `k` steps, updating the score and tracking the current position.
  - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), it calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
  - It then uses this information to compute the score for the remaining steps efficiently.
- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly handles the movement and scoring for each step.
  - The cycle detection logic is sound and correctly identifies when a cycle is encountered.
  - The calculation of the remaining steps after detecting a cycle is efficient and correct.

### Function 3: `func_2()`
- **Behavior**:
  - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it extracts the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
  - It prints the results for each test case.
- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly reads and processes the input.
  - It handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
  - The results are collected and printed correctly.

### Annotated Code Analysis
- **Initial State**:
  - The program starts with `func_2` reading the input and processing it.
  - The input is correctly split and parsed.
- **During `calculate_score`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the score, current position, steps, and visited dictionary.
  - The while loop iterates for `k` steps, updating the score and current position.
  - Cycle detection is correctly implemented, and the cycle length and score are calculated.
  - The remaining steps are handled efficiently by using the cycle information.
- **Final State**:
  - The final score is returned by `calculate_score`.
  - `func_1` correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result.
  - `func_2` prints the results for each test case.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic
- **Cycle Detection**: The cycle detection logic is robust and correctly handles cases where the permutation forms cycles.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_2` is correct and ensures that all test cases are processed.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently handles large values of `k` by using cycle detection, which is crucial for the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the described "Permutation game" for all potential cases, including cycle detection and efficient score calculation for large `k` values. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**
