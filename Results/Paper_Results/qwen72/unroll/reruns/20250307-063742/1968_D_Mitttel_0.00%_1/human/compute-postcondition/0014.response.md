Output State: **score = 60, current_pos = 1, steps = 3, visited = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, cycle_start = 0, cycle_length = 3, cycle_score = 6, cycle_pos = 1, remaining_steps = k - 3, full_cycles = (k - 3) // 3**

The value of `full_cycles` is calculated as the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`. Since `remaining_steps` is `k - 3` and `cycle_length` is 3, `full_cycles` is `(k - 3) // 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
