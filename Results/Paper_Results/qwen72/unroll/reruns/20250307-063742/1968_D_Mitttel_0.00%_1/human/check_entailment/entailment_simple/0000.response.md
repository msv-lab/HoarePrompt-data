### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads all input at once and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes the input for each test case by parsing the necessary values (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) and calling `func_1` with these values.
   - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - `calculate_score` is responsible for simulating the game for a given starting position.
   - The function initializes `score` to 0, `current_pos` to the starting position, and `steps` to 0.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, updating the score and current position based on the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), it calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
   - It then updates the score for the remaining steps by adding the score for full cycles and the remaining steps after the full cycles.

3. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection is correct. If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The function correctly handles the remaining steps after the full cycles by iterating through the cycle for the remaining steps.

4. **Comparison and Result**:
   - `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha, compares their scores, and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - The comparison logic is correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts only one turn (`k = 1`).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the starting positions are the same (`PB = PS`).
   - The program handles large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently using cycle detection and calculation.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted as specified in the problem description, with each result printed on a new line.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified edge cases and efficiently calculates the scores using cycle detection.

**Correctness: True**
