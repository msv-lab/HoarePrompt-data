Reasoning:

The program provided appears to be well-structured and logically sound for solving the "Permutation game" problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the parameters for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - This function correctly handles the input format and ensures that all test cases are processed.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` starts with an initial score of 0 and the player's starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of positions and the step at which they were visited to detect cycles.
   - It iterates through the game for up to `k` steps, adding the score from the current position and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and the total score for one complete cycle.
   - It then calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle, including the full cycles and the remainder steps.
   - This function correctly handles both the non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios, ensuring that the score is calculated accurately for any number of turns `k`.

3. **Game Outcome Determination (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - This function correctly determines the winner based on the scores calculated by `calculate_score`.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)) efficiently by detecting cycles and using cycle properties to avoid simulating each step individually.
   - It correctly handles the case where the starting positions are the same.
   - The program also handles the case where the permutation and array lengths are at their maximum limits (`n` up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all aspects of the problem as described. The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
