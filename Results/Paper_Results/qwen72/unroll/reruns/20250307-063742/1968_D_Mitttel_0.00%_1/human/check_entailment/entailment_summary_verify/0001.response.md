### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at positions `PB` and `PS` respectively.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions the player visits.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` for their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

3. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`):**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach each position.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player revisits a position), it calculates the score for the remaining steps by identifying the cycle length and the score within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

4. **Function 3 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.
   - The function is correct in its logic and structure.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read in a single batch and split into a list of integers.
   - The indices are correctly managed to parse the input for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same or different.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles using a dictionary `visited` to track the positions and the steps taken to reach them.
  - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and the score within the cycle.
  - It then uses this information to efficiently compute the score for the remaining steps, which is crucial for large values of `k`.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score is correctly accumulated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions the player visits.
  - The function handles the case where the player stays at the same position or moves to a new position as specified by the permutation `p`.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The `func_2` function reads the input in a single batch and processes it correctly.
  - It correctly parses the input for each test case and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
  - The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles all the aspects of the problem as described. It correctly calculates the scores for both players, detects cycles, and determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

Final: **True**
