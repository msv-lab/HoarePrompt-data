Output State: **score = 60, current_pos = 1, steps = 3, visited = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, cycle_start = 0, cycle_length = 3, cycle_score = 6, cycle_pos = 1, remaining_steps = k - 3, full_cycles = (k - 3) // 3, remainder_steps = (k - 3) % 3**

The value of `remainder_steps` is calculated as `(k - 3) % 3`, which is the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. All other variables remain unchanged.
