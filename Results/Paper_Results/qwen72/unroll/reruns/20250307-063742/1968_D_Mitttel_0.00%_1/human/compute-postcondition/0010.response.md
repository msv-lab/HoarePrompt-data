Output State: **The `index` remains 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t. `t` remains the integer value of the string at `data[0]`. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. `data` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element.
- The loop does not modify the `index`, `t`, `results`, or `data` variables.
- Therefore, the state of these variables remains the same as in the initial state.
