The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the positions `PB` and `PS` in the permutation list `p` and the corresponding values in list `a`. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The function does not modify any of the input parameters.
