Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem where Bodya and Sasha play a game on a permutation and an array, and the goal is to determine the winner based on their scores after `k` turns. The program is structured into three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`.

1. **`func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

2. **`func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both `PB` and `PS` to get the scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The function correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the scores.

3. **`calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position `start_pos`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to `start_pos`.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value from `a` at the current position to the score and moving to the position specified by `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle's length and score.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation for the remaining steps.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and the functions are implemented correctly to handle the input and output as specified. The cycle detection and score calculation in `calculate_score` are also correctly implemented to handle large values of `k` efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
