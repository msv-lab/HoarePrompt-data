Postcondition: **`score` is 60. If `cycle_start` is not -1, then `score` is updated to 60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 6 + sum(a[i] for i in range(remainder_steps)), and `current_pos` is updated to `p[remainder_steps % 3 - 1]`. If `cycle_start` is -1, `score` and `current_pos` remain unchanged. `steps` is 3, and `visited` is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}.**
