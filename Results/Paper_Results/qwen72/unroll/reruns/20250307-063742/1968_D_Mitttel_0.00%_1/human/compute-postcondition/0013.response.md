Output State: **score = 60, current_pos = 1, steps = 3, visited = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, cycle_start = 0, cycle_length = 3, cycle_score = 6, cycle_pos = 1, remaining_steps = k - 3.**

The value of `remaining_steps` is calculated as `k - 3`, where `k` is an unknown variable. All other variables remain unchanged.
