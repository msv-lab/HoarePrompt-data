The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters, and calls `func_1` for each set. It collects the results of these calls into a list and prints each result. After the function concludes, `index` is set to 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` is the number of test cases, and `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding test case. The input data remains unchanged.
