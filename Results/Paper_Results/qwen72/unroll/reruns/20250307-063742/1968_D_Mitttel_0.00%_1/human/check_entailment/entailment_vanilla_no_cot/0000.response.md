Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

2. **Function 2 (calculate_score)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by:
     - Determining the cycle length and cycle score.
     - Adding the score for full cycles.
     - Adding the score for the remaining steps within the cycle.
   - This ensures that the function correctly handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios.

3. **Function 3 (func_2)**:
   - This function reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

The program correctly handles the input constraints and the game logic, ensuring that the scores are calculated accurately for both players and the correct winner is determined. Therefore, the program is correct.
