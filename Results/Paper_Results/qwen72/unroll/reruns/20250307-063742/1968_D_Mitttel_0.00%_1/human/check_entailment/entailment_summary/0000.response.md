Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format, extracting the number of test cases `t` and the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.

2. **Score Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions `PB` and `PS`.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on the comparison.

3. **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle's length and score.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the player stays in the same position or moves to the next position in the permutation.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program correctly implements the game rules as described in the problem statement.
   - It processes multiple test cases efficiently and returns the correct results for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem description and correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
