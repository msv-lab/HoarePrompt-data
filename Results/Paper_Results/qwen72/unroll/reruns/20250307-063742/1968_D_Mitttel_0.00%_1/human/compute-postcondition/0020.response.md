Output State: **The program returns 60.** 

In the initial state, `score` is 60. The condition for updating `score` and `current_pos` is that `cycle_start` must not be -1. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `cycle_start` other than it could be -1, we assume `cycle_start` is -1. Therefore, `score` and `current_pos` remain unchanged. The program returns `score`, which is still 60.
