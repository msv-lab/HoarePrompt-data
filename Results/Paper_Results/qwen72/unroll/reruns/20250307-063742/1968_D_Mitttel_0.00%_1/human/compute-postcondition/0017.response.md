The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `remainder_steps`. For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `score = 60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 6`
- `current_pos = 1`
- `steps = 3`
- `visited = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}`
- `cycle_start = 0`
- `cycle_length = 3`
- `cycle_score = 6`
- `cycle_pos = 1`
- `remaining_steps = k - 3`
- `full_cycles = (k - 3) // 3`
- `remainder_steps = (k - 3) % 3`

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `remainder_steps` to be greater than 0. The other variables are not in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`score = 60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 6`, `current_pos = 1`, `steps = 3`, `visited = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}`, `cycle_start = 0`, `cycle_length = 3`, `cycle_score = 6`, `cycle_pos = 1`, `remaining_steps = k - 3`, `full_cycles = (k - 3) // 3`, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
