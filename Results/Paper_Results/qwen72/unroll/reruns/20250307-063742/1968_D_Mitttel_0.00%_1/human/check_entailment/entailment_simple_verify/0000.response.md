Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and correctly parses it into the required variables for each test case. The parsing logic is sound and follows the problem description.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The `calculate_score` function is responsible for calculating the score for a player starting from a given position. It correctly handles the movement and scoring for each step.
   - The function uses a `visited` dictionary to detect cycles in the permutation. This is crucial because the game can last for a very large number of turns (`k` can be up to \(10^9\)), and detecting cycles allows the function to efficiently compute the score for the remaining turns.
   - When a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and cycle score. It then uses these to compute the total score for the remaining steps, which is done correctly by adding the score for full cycles and the score for the remaining steps after the full cycles.

3. **Cycle Detection and Handling:**
   - The cycle detection logic is implemented correctly. If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and the total score for one full cycle. It then uses this information to compute the score for the remaining steps efficiently.
   - The state annotations provided in the `calculate_score` function show that the function correctly updates the score and current position when a cycle is detected and when handling the remaining steps.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The `func_1` function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha, compares their scores, and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'). This logic is straightforward and correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1, when the starting positions are the same, and when the permutation and array are of the smallest possible size (1 element). The cycle detection and handling logic ensures that the program works correctly even for large values of `k`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The cycle detection and handling ensure that the score calculation for large `k` values is done in a reasonable amount of time.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" and handles all potential cases, including cycle detection and efficient score calculation.

Final: **True**
