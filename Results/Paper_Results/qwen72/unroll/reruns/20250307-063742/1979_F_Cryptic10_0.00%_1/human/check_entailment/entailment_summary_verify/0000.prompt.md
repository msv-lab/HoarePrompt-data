You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(d):
    print(f'? {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    (v, u) = map(int, input().split())
    return (v, u)

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            (v, u) = func_1(d)
            if v == 0:
                continue
            if v in remaining_vertices:
                path.append(v)
                remaining_vertices.remove(v)
                break
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    sys.stdout.flush()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) and initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It constructs a list `path` by iteratively selecting and removing vertices from `remaining_vertices` based on the output of `func_1`. After all vertices are removed, the function prints a string that starts with `!` followed by the integers in `path` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` contains integers from 1 to `n` in some order. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the graph is such that the vertex with the minimum degree and the vertex with the minimum number not connected to it are not the ones that should be part of the Hamiltonian path. Specifically, the program assumes that the vertex with the minimum degree (and the minimum number among those with the minimum degree) and the vertex with the minimum number not connected to it will always be part of the Hamiltonian path. However, this is not necessarily true for all graphs, especially when the graph is modified through the removal of vertices and edges during the queries.

Consider the following example:

- **Graph**: A complete undirected graph with 4 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4) where the edges (1, 2) and (1, 3) are removed.
- **Initial State**: The graph has the following edges: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4).

The program will start by querying for the vertex with the highest degree (3 in this case):

1. **Query**: `? 3`
   - **Response**: "0 0" (since no vertex has a degree of 3)
2. **Query**: `? 2`
   - **Response**: "1 4" (vertex 1 has a degree of 2, and vertex 4 is the only vertex not connected to it)
   - **Action**: The program adds vertex 1 to the path and removes it from the graph.
3. **Query**: `? 2`
   - **Response**: "2 3" (vertex 2 has a degree of 2, and vertex 3 is the only vertex not connected to it)
   - **Action**: The program adds vertex 2 to the path and removes it from the graph.
4. **Query**: `? 1`
   - **Response**: "3 0" (vertex 3 has a degree of 1, and it is not connected to any remaining vertex)
   - **Action**: The program adds vertex 3 to the path and removes it from the graph.
5. **Remaining Vertex**: Vertex 4 is the only remaining vertex, so it is added to the path.

The program will output the path: `! 1 2 3 4`.

However, the correct Hamiltonian path in this graph is `4 3 2 1` or `4 2 3 1` or any permutation that includes all vertices exactly once and respects the edge removals. The program fails to find a valid Hamiltonian path because it does not consider the connectivity and the order of vertices in a way that ensures the path is Hamiltonian.

This example demonstrates that the program does not always find a valid Hamiltonian path, and thus it is incorrect.
