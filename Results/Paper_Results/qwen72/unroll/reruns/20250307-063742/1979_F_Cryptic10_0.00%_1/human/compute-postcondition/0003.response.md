Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `path` is a list containing integers from 1 to n in some order.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has finished executing, all the integers from 1 to n that were initially in the `remaining_vertices` set have been removed, making `remaining_vertices` an empty set. The `path` list will contain all these integers, but the order in which they appear depends on the behavior of the `func_1` function. Each integer from 1 to n will appear exactly once in the `path` list.
