Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) and initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It constructs a list `path` by iteratively selecting and removing vertices from `remaining_vertices` based on the output of `func_1`. After all vertices are removed, the function prints a string that starts with `!` followed by the integers in `path` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` contains integers from 1 to `n` in some order. The function does not return any value. **
