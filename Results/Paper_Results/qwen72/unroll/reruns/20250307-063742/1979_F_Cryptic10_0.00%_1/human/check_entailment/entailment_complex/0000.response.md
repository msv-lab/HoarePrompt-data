### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices after \( n-2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We can make up to \( n \) queries to determine the vertices and their connections.
   - Each query is of the form `"? d"`, which returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is `0 0`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(d)**: This function sends a query to the interactor and reads the response. It correctly handles the query format and input reading.
   - **func_2(n)**: This function constructs the Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the interactor and removing vertices from the set of remaining vertices. It uses a loop to find the vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria and appends it to the path.

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` starts with all vertices in the set `remaining_vertices`.
   - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it queries the interactor using `func_1(d)`.
   - If the interactor returns a valid vertex \( v \) (i.e., \( v \neq 0 \)), it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - This process continues until all vertices are removed from `remaining_vertices`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` ensures that it makes at most \( n \) queries by iterating over the degrees and only adding valid vertices to the path.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the interactor returns `0 0` by continuing to the next degree.
   - The final path is printed in the required format, and the function ensures that all vertices are included in the path.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the function will correctly handle the single edge case.
   - For larger \( n \), the function will iteratively remove vertices and construct the path, ensuring that the path is Hamiltonian.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly follows the problem constraints and logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph. It makes valid queries and handles the responses appropriately to construct the path.

Correctness: **True**
