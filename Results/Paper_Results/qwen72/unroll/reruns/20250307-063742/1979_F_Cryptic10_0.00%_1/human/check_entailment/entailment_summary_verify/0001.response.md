### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, and \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it (if any).

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns the two integers \( v \) and \( u \).

3. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0, making queries to find a vertex with the required degree.
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found and it is in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Query Efficiency:** The function makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit. This is correct because the loop iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0, and each query is expected to find a vertex and remove it from the set.
   - **Vertex Selection:** The function correctly selects vertices with the minimum degree that are not connected to the vertex with the minimum number. This is achieved by the loop that iterates over the degrees and the condition `if v in remaining_vertices`.
   - **Path Construction:** The function constructs the path by removing vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is added to the path exactly once. The set `remaining_vertices` is used to keep track of which vertices have not been added to the path yet.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:** The function handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree. This is done by the `if v == 0: continue` statement.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Degree Range:** The function iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0. This is correct because the maximum degree in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices is \( n-1 \), and the minimum degree after removing \( n-2 \) edges is 0.
   - **Vertex Removal:** The function correctly removes vertices from the set of remaining vertices and appends them to the path. This ensures that each vertex is processed exactly once.
   - **Interactor Response:** The function correctly handles the interactor's response and continues the process until all vertices are added to the path. The response `0 0` is correctly interpreted as no vertex being found, and the loop continues to the next degree.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program follows the problem constraints and correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using the allowed number of queries.
   - The logic for selecting vertices and constructing the path is sound and matches the problem requirements.
   - The function summaries and the original assessment are accurate in describing the behavior and correctness of the program.
