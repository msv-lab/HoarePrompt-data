### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, and \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it (if any).

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns the two integers \( v \) and \( u \).

3. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0, making queries to find a vertex with the required degree.
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found and it is in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Query Efficiency:** The function makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - **Vertex Selection:** The function correctly selects vertices with the minimum degree that are not connected to the vertex with the minimum number.
   - **Path Construction:** The function constructs the path by removing vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:** The function handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Degree Range:** The function iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0. This is correct because the maximum degree in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices is \( n-1 \), and the minimum degree after removing \( n-2 \) edges is 0.
   - **Vertex Removal:** The function correctly removes vertices from the set of remaining vertices and appends them to the path.
   - **Interactor Response:** The function correctly handles the interactor's response and continues the process until all vertices are added to the path.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program follows the problem constraints and correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using the allowed number of queries.
   - The logic for selecting vertices and constructing the path is sound and matches the problem requirements.
