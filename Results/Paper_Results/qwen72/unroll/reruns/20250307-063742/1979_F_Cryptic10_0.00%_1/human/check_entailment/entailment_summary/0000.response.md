Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph that initially is a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We can make at most \( n \) queries to the interactor to determine the vertices and their connections.
   - Each query `"? d"` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \) (or 0 if no such vertex exists).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function sends a query to the interactor and reads the response. It returns the vertex \( v \) and the vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \).
   - **func_2**: This function constructs the Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the interactor and removing vertices from the set of remaining vertices. It starts with the highest possible degree and works its way down to the lowest degree.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Initialization**: `path` is an empty list, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
   - **Query Loop**: The function iterates over possible degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0. For each degree \( d \):
     - It calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - **Termination**: The loop continues until all vertices are removed from `remaining_vertices`. Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Query Efficiency**: The function `func_2` makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - **Vertex Selection**: The function correctly selects vertices based on the degree and ensures that the selected vertex is removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - **Path Construction**: The function constructs the path by iteratively selecting vertices and ensuring that each vertex is only added once to the path.
   - **Hamiltonian Path**: The problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path always exists under the given constraints. The function `func_2` ensures that all vertices are included in the path exactly once, which aligns with the definition of a Hamiltonian path.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is a single edge, and the function correctly identifies the two vertices and constructs the path.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the function should handle the case where the graph is a triangle with one edge removed, and it correctly identifies the vertices and constructs the path.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by constructing a Hamiltonian path within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
