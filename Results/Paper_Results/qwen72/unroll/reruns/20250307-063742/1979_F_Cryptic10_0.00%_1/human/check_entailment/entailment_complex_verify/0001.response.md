### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it (if any).

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns the two integers \( v \) and \( u \).
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

3. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0, making queries to find a vertex with the required degree.
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found and it is in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Query Efficiency:** The function makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit. This is correct because the loop iterates over \( n \) degrees, and each query is made once per degree.
   - **Vertex Selection:** The function correctly selects vertices with the minimum degree that are not connected to the vertex with the minimum number. This is achieved by iterating from the highest degree down to the lowest, ensuring that the first valid vertex found is the one with the minimum degree.
   - **Path Construction:** The function constructs the path by removing vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is added to the path exactly once. This is correct as the vertices are removed from the set `remaining_vertices` and appended to the list `path`.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:** The function handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree. This is correct because if \( v == 0 \), it continues to the next degree.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Degree Range:** The function iterates over the degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0. This is correct because the maximum degree in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices is \( n-1 \), and the minimum degree after removing \( n-2 \) edges is 0.
   - **Vertex Removal:** The function correctly removes vertices from the set of remaining vertices and appends them to the path.
   - **Interactor Response:** The function correctly handles the interactor's response and continues the process until all vertices are added to the path.

6. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - **Query Loop:** The function iterates over degrees from \( n-1 \) to 0, making queries to find a vertex with the required degree.
   - **Response Handling:** If the interactor returns \( v == 0 \), the function continues to the next degree. If a valid vertex \( v \) is found, it is added to the path and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - **Final State:** After the loop, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` contains integers from 1 to \( n \) in some order.
   - **Output:** The function prints the path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

### Conclusion:
- The program follows the problem constraints and correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using the allowed number of queries.
- The logic for selecting vertices and constructing the path is sound and matches the problem requirements.
- The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and handles the interactor's responses appropriately.

### Final:
Correctness: **True**
