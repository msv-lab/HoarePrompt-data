The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n` which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. It also implicitly accepts a set `remaining_vertices` of integers representing the vertices of the graph that have not been removed yet. The function returns a value based on the input `n` and the state of `remaining_vertices`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) and a set `remaining_vertices` of integers representing vertices in a graph. It returns a value based on the input `n` and the current set of `remaining_vertices`.**
