For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `remaining_vertices` must evaluate to `True`. In Python, a set evaluates to `True` if it is not empty. Given the state right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`. This means `remaining_vertices` is not empty, as it contains at least one element (since `n` is at least 2).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n, inclusive, `path` is an empty list**
