Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `path` is a list containing integers from 1 to n in some order.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately, but it does not change the state of any variables in the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
