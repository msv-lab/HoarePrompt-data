The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `x` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it doesn't need an initial value. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the edges of the tree are represented by n-1 pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node for the round is an integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory**
