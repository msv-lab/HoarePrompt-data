The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `u_1`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is an integer and `t=1`, `edges` is a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` where \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), and `u_1` is an integer representing the starting node for the round, where \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\).

The function returns the result of a computation based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, given the context, it is likely that the function processes a tree structure defined by `n` nodes and `edges`, and performs some operation starting from node `u_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `u_1`. It processes a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, starting from node `u_1`, and returns a result based on this processing.**
