Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the edges of the tree are represented by n-1 pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node for the round is an integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are now specific integers provided by the input. The other variables (`n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
