Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the edges of the tree are represented by n-1 pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node for the round is an integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `lst` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `lst` will automatically create a new list for any key that is accessed but not yet present in the dictionary. The values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, the starting node `u_1`, and the input integers `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
