Functionality: ** The function processes a tree structure represented by a set of edges and a starting node. It reads the number of nodes `x` and a value `y` from input, constructs adjacency lists `lst` and `rev` for the tree, and then performs two traversals starting from a given node `z`. The first traversal follows the forward edges, toggling a boolean `one` based on the parity of the path length. The second traversal follows the reverse edges, toggling a boolean `two` similarly. The function prints 'Hermione' if both `one` and `two` are `True` after the traversals, and 'Ron' otherwise. The function does not return any value. **
