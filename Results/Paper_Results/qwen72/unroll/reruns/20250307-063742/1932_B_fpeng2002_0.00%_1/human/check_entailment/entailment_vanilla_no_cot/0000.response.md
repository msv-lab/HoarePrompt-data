Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here is a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign is expected to occur.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: The program iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`), and for each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year after the previous sign has occurred.
4. **Calculation**: The key calculation is `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. This is done by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure the next sign occurs after the current year.
   - Dividing by the periodicity of the current sign and taking the ceiling of the result to find the next multiple of the periodicity.
   - Multiplying back by the periodicity to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program also handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
