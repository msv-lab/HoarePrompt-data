### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculation of Start Year:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
   - The loop iterates over each periodicity in `nums` and updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the sign after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next year in which the sign occurs. This formula works as follows:
     - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next year is strictly after the current `start_year`.
     - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the sign up to the next year.
     - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
     - `* nums[x]` calculates the exact year of the next occurrence.

3. **Sequential Occurrence:**
   - The formula ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. For example, if `start_year` is 3 and the next periodicity is 2, the next occurrence will be in year 4, not year 3.
   - This aligns with the problem's requirement that signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated `start_year` for each test case, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `start_year = 0`
  - For `3`: `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `2`: `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For `4`: `((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For `5`: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For `9`: `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For `18`: `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `start_year = 0`
  - For `1`: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `2`: `((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - For `3`: `((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `4`: `((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - For `5`: `((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `start_year = 0`
  - For `1`: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `1`: `((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - For `1`: `((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - For `1`: `((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - For `1`: `((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `start_year = 0`
  - For `50`: `((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For `30`: `((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 90`
  - For `711`: `((90 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For `200`: `((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - For `503`: `((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - For `1006`: `((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The formula used is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
