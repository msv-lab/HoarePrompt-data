Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It takes the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of signs and their periodicities, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The calculation of `start_year` ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which correctly finds the next occurrence of the sign after the previous sign has occurred. This logic is consistent with the problem's requirement that signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential inputs.
