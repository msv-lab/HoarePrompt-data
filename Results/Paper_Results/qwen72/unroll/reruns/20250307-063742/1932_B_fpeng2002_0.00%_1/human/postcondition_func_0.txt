The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it calculates a start year based on the provided list of integers and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `num_tests` set to 0, and the last processed `n` and `nums` retained. The variables `t` and `a` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function.
