Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem by calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num_tests` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Start Year:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting point for the first sign.
   - For each sign in the list `nums`, the function calculates the next occurrence of the sign strictly after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula used is `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
     - `start_year + 1` ensures that we start waiting for the next sign after the current year.
     - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year + 1`.
     - `+ 1` ensures we move to the next cycle.
     - `* nums[x]` calculates the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the function prints the calculated `start_year`.
   - The function then moves to the next test case until all test cases are processed.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the first test case with `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - First sign occurs in year 3.
     - Second sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4).
     - Third sign occurs in year 8 (since 4 + 1 = 5, and the next multiple of 4 after 5 is 8).
     - Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since 8 + 1 = 9, and the next multiple of 5 after 9 is 10).
     - Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since 10 + 1 = 11, and the next multiple of 9 after 11 is 18).
     - Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since 18 + 1 = 19, and the next multiple of 18 after 19 is 36).

   - For the second test case with `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - First sign occurs in year 1.
     - Second sign occurs in year 2 (since 1 + 1 = 2).
     - Third sign occurs in year 3 (since 2 + 1 = 3).
     - Fourth sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4).
     - Fifth sign occurs in year 5 (since 4 + 1 = 5).

   - For the third test case with `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - Each sign occurs in the next year after the previous one, so the final year is 5.

   - For the fourth test case with `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
     - First sign occurs in year 50.
     - Second sign occurs in year 60 (since 50 + 1 = 51, and the next multiple of 30 after 51 is 60).
     - Third sign occurs in year 711 (since 60 + 1 = 61, and the next multiple of 711 after 61 is 711).
     - Fourth sign occurs in year 800 (since 711 + 1 = 712, and the next multiple of 200 after 712 is 800).
     - Fifth sign occurs in year 1006 (since 800 + 1 = 801, and the next multiple of 503 after 801 is 1006).
     - Sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (since 1006 + 1 = 1007, and the next multiple of 1006 after 1007 is 2012).

The function correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the function.
