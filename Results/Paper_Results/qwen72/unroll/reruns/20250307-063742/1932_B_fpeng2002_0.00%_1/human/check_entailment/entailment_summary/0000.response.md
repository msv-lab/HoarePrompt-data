Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and the periodicities of these signs.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it occurs strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start_year} = \left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the previous sign by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to move to the next year.
   - Dividing by `nums[x]` to find the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
   - Adding 1 to ensure it's the next multiple.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year.

5. Finally, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- For the first test case:
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- For the second test case:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- For the third test case:
  - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- For the fourth test case:
  - `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 90`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((90 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic and the execution summary match the problem description and the expected outputs.
