Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is the last input integer, nums is the last list of n integers, start_year is the calculated start year for the last test case, t is unchanged, a is unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs until `num_tests` becomes 0, so after the loop, `num_tests` will be 0.
- The variable `n` will be the last input integer provided for the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- The list `nums` will be the last list of integers provided as input during the loop.
- The variable `start_year` will be the calculated start year for the last test case, based on the logic inside the loop.
- The variables `t` and `a` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged from their initial state.
