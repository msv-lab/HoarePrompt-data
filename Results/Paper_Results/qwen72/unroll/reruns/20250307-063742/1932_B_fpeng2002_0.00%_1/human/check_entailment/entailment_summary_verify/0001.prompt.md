You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it calculates a start year based on the provided list of integers and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `num_tests` set to 0, and the last processed `n` and `nums` retained. The variables `t` and `a` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, and the `i`-th sign must occur strictly after the `(i-1)`-th sign.
- We need to find the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it occurs strictly after the previous sign.

4. **Update `start_year`:**
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next occurrence of the `x`-th sign.
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the quotient when `start_year + 1` is divided by `nums[x]`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
   - `* nums[x]` gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` which is the year in which the `x`-th sign will occur.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **First sign (3):**
  - `start_year = 0`
  - Next occurrence: `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = (1 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3`
- **Second sign (2):**
  - `start_year = 3`
  - Next occurrence: `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`
- **Third sign (4):**
  - `start_year = 6`
  - Next occurrence: `((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = (7 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`
- **Fourth sign (5):**
  - `start_year = 8`
  - Next occurrence: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = (9 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`
- **Fifth sign (9):**
  - `start_year = 10`
  - Next occurrence: `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = (11 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 2 * 9 = 18`
- **Sixth sign (18):**
  - `start_year = 18`
  - Next occurrence: `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = (19 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36`

The program correctly outputs `36` for this test case.

#### Test Case 2: `1 2 3 4 5`
- **First sign (1):**
  - `start_year = 0`
  - Next occurrence: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2 * 1 = 1`
- **Second sign (2):**
  - `start_year = 1`
  - Next occurrence: `((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`
- **Third sign (3):**
  - `start_year = 4`
  - Next occurrence: `((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = (5 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6`
- **Fourth sign (4):**
  - `start_year = 6`
  - Next occurrence: `((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = (7 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`
- **Fifth sign (5):**
  - `start_year = 8`
  - Next occurrence: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = (9 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`

The program correctly outputs `10` for this test case, but the expected output is `5`. This indicates a potential issue.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic of finding the next occurrence of each sign is correct.
- However, the initial value of `start_year` should be 1, not 0, to ensure the first sign occurs in the correct year.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 1  # Initialize start_year to 1
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Final Correctness:
- After initializing `start_year` to 1, the program should correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True** (after the correction)
