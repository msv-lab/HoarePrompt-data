Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array `b` is sorted, which is necessary to ensure that the maximum possible differences can be considered. A max heap (using negative values to simulate it with `heapq`) is initialized to store the differences and their corresponding indices.

3. **Heap Population**: For each element in array `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in the sorted array `b`. It then pushes the larger of these differences into the heap, along with the original element and the index of the element from `b` that produced the larger difference.

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`. It ensures that the chosen elements from `b` are distinct by maintaining two pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to the smallest and largest available elements in `b`. If the element in the heap corresponds to an index that is no longer available (i.e., it has been used), the program recalculates the differences with the current available smallest and largest elements.

5. **Difference Calculation**: The program correctly adds the maximum differences to the total `ans` and updates the pointers to ensure that the next available elements are considered.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case, which is the required output.

The logic and implementation are sound and should handle the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
