The function `func` is designed to be executed as the main module. It processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a_i`, and a list of `m` integers `b_i`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in `a_i` and the closest elements in the sorted list `b_i`. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the sum of these maximum absolute differences for each test case has been printed to the console. If the function is not executed as the main module, it does not perform any actions and leaves the variables and output unchanged.
