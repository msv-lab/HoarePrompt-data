The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n` and `m`: Integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a_i`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `b_i`: A list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as:

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a_i`, and a list of `m` integers `b_i`. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given constraints.**
