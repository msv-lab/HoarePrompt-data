### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting `b`**: The program sorts the list `b` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Vasya to choose the smallest or largest available element from `b` to maximize the absolute difference with each element in `a`.

3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to store the potential differences between each element in `a` and the smallest or largest element in `b`. The heap is initialized with tuples containing:
   - The negative of the maximum difference (`-diff1` or `-diff2`) to simulate a max heap using Python's `heapq` (which is a min heap by default).
   - The element from `a` that is being compared.
   - The index of the element in `b` that was used to compute the maximum difference.

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to ensure that the elements in `b` are used optimally:
   - It pops the element with the highest difference from the heap.
   - If the index of the element in `b` is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recomputes the difference using the current smallest (`b[tp1]`) or largest (`b[tp2]`) available element in `b`.
   - It updates the answer `ans` with the maximum difference and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the next element in `b` is considered.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum total difference `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the chosen elements of `b`.

### Correctness:
The program follows the correct logic to maximize the total difference `D` by always choosing the element in `b` that provides the largest absolute difference with each element in `a`. The use of a heap ensures that the largest differences are considered first, and the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` ensure that each element in `b` is used exactly once.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly, including when `m = n` and when all elements in `b` are the same.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
