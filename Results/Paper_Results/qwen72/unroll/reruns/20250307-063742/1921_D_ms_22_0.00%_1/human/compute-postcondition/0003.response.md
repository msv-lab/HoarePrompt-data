Output State: **t is 0, and the program has printed the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute until `t` is 0, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the loop reads `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
- It then sorts `b` and uses a max heap to store the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the smallest or largest elements in `b`.
- The loop processes the heap to ensure that the maximum absolute differences are used, and updates the `ans` variable with the sum of these differences.
- After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.
- Once all test cases are processed, `t` is 0, and the program has printed the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each test case.
