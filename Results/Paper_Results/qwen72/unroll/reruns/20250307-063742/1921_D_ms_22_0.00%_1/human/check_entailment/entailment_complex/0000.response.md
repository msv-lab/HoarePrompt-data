### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It ensures that `t` is decremented for each test case, and the loop continues until `t` is 0.

2. **Sorting `b`**:
   - The program sorts the list `b` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily find the smallest and largest elements in `b` for each element in `a`.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap is used to store tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the smallest or largest element in `b`.
   - The negative sign is used to simulate a max heap using Python's `heapq` (which is a min heap by default).

4. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - It then pushes the larger of these two differences into the max heap along with the original element `i` and the index of the element in `b` that produced the larger difference.

5. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops elements from the heap and checks if the index of the element in `b` is still within the valid range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences with the new smallest (`b[tp1]`) and largest (`b[tp2]`) elements in the remaining part of `b`.
   - If the index is within range, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the pointers `tp1` or `tp2` accordingly.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `m == n` and all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case).
  - It also handles the case where `m > n` and the elements in `b` are distinct (e.g., the first and third test cases).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step is `O(m log m)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The heap operations are `O(n log n)`, which is also efficient given the constraints.

- **Logic**:
  - The logic of using a max heap to always choose the largest possible difference is sound.
  - The program correctly updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the elements in `b` are used efficiently to maximize the total difference.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be logically correct and handles the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
