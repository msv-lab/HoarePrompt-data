The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It calculates the maximum profit value by evaluating the profit at different points within the range `[0, min(n, b)]` using the function `func_1`. The function returns the maximum profit value found. After the function concludes, `low` is the value where the maximum profit is achieved, `high` is `low - 1`, and `max_profit` contains the maximum profit value.
