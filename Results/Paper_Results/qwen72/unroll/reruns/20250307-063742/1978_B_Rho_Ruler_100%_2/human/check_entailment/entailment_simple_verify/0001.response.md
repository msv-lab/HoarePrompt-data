### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1)`. This is a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - The function returns the sum of these two values, which is the correct profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`**
   - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases).
   - The range `0` to `min(n, b)` is correct for `k` because `k` must be within the bounds of the number of buns and the maximum modified price.
   - The binary search correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`:
     - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially increase the profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - **Example 1**:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
     - Optimal `k = 1`:
       - `profit = 1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
     - The program should return `17`.
   - **Example 2**:
     - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Optimal `k = 5`:
       - `profit = 5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
     - The program should return `35`.
   - **Example 3**:
     - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
     - Optimal `k = 0`:
       - `profit = 0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 100 = 100`
     - The program should return `100`.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `k = 0` or `k = min(n, b)`.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, even for large values of `n` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate.

Final: **True**
