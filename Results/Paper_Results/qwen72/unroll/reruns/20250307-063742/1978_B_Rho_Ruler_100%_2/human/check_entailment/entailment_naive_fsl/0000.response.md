Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k`, and the function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. The binary search ensures that all potential values of `k` are considered, and the maximum profit is correctly computed. The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when `n` is equal to `b`. The output for the given test cases matches the expected results, and no potential cases have been identified where the program fails to produce the correct profit.
