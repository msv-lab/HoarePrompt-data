The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. For the loop to execute, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`

Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, the minimum value between `n` and `b` will always be at least 1. Therefore, `high` will always be at least 1, and `low` is 0, which means `low` is always less than or equal to `high` in the first iteration.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
