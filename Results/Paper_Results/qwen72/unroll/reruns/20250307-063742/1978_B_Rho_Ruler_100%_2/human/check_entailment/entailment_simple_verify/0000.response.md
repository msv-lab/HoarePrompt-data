### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the total profit.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining `(n - k)` buns.
   - The term `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, which is a decreasing arithmetic series.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.
   - The function correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n, a, b)` uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search range is from `0` to `min(n, b)`, which is the valid range for `k`.
   - The loop continues while `low <= high`, ensuring that all potential values of `k` are considered.
   - `mid` is the midpoint of the current range, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the profits for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`, respectively.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` by 1 results in a higher profit, so the search continues in the upper half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` by 1 does not result in a higher profit, so the search continues in the lower half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit` and returned at the end.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - When `k = min(n, b)`, all buns are sold at the modified price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found, even for edge cases.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2(n, a, b)` and prints the result.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The binary search approach ensures that all potential values of `k` are considered, and the maximum profit is correctly computed. The program handles edge cases and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Final: **True**
