Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
2. **Conditions**:
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price: the i-th bun costs `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`.

### Program Analysis:
#### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given `k`:
- `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
- `(n - k) * a` calculates the total profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
- The function returns the sum of these two values.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit:
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
- It iterates using a binary search to find the best `k`:
  - `mid` is the midpoint of the current range.
  - `profit_mid` is the profit for `k = mid`.
  - `profit_next` is the profit for `k = mid + 1`.
  - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially increase the profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- The function keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Function 1**:
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1)`.
   - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining buns.
   - The function returns the correct profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function 2**:
   - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases).
   - The range `0` to `min(n, b)` is correct for `k`.
   - The binary search correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
   - The function correctly keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 1`:
     - `profit = 1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - The program should return `17`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Optimal `k = 5`:
     - `profit = 5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
   - The program should return `35`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 0`:
     - `profit = 0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 100 = 100`
   - The program should return `100`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate.

Correctness: **True**
