You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, n, a, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the value of the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It returns a single integer value calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. The purpose of the function is to compute a specific mathematical expression based on the given parameters. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the function's return value is the result of the expression.

    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit value, which is the value of `max_profit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It calculates the maximum profit value by evaluating the profit at different points within the range `[0, min(n, b)]` using the function `func_1`. The function returns the maximum profit value found. After the function concludes, `low` is the value where the maximum profit is achieved, `high` is `low - 1`, and `max_profit` contains the maximum profit value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
2. **Conditions**:
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price: the i-th bun costs `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`.

### Program Analysis:
#### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given `k`:
- `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
- `(n - k) * a` calculates the total profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
- The function returns the sum of these two values.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit:
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
- It iterates using a binary search to find the best `k`:
  - `mid` is the midpoint of the current range.
  - `profit_mid` is the profit for `k = mid`.
  - `profit_next` is the profit for `k = mid + 1`.
  - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially increase the profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- The function keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Function 1**:
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1)`.
   - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining buns.
   - The function returns the correct profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function 2**:
   - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases).
   - The range `0` to `min(n, b)` is correct for `k`.
   - The binary search correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
   - The function correctly keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 1`:
     - `profit = 1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - The program should return `17`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Optimal `k = 5`:
     - `profit = 5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
   - The program should return `35`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 0`:
     - `profit = 0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 100 = 100`
   - The program should return `100`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate.
