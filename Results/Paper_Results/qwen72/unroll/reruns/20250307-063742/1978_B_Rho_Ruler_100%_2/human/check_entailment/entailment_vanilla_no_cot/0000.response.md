Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and will solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price). The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
   \]
   - \( k \cdot b \) is the total price of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
   - \( \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which represents the discount applied to the modified prices.
   - \( (n - k) \cdot a \) is the total price of the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the range of possible values for `k` (from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\)).
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means increasing `k` is beneficial, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

3. **Binary Search**: The binary search is used to efficiently find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. This is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases).

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - When \( k = n \), all buns are sold at the modified price.
   - When \( n \) or \( b \) are large, the binary search ensures that the solution is found efficiently without iterating through all possible values of `k`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the maximum profit for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct and will produce the expected results.
