### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the profit for a given `k`.
- **Formula**:
  - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. This is correct because it sums the arithmetic sequence from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
  - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price. This is also correct.
- **Return**: The sum of the two values, which is the total profit for the given `k`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit using binary search.
- **Range**: `0` to `min(n, b)`, which is correct as per the problem constraints.
- **Binary Search**:
  - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
  - `profit_mid` is the profit for `k = mid`.
  - `profit_next` is the profit for `k = mid + 1`.
  - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially increase the profit, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- **Max Profit Tracking**: The function keeps track of the maximum profit found and returns it.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 1`:
     - `profit = 1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - The program should return `17`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Optimal `k = 5`:
     - `profit = 5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
   - The program should return `35`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Optimal `k = 0`:
     - `profit = 0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 100 = 100`
   - The program should return `100`.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)), the binary search ensures that the solution is found efficiently.
  - When `a` is very large, the profit calculation for the usual price buns is straightforward and correct.
  - When `b` is very large, the modified price calculation is also correct and efficient.

- **Unimodal Profit Function**:
  - The profit function is unimodal, meaning it increases to a point and then decreases. This is a key property that allows the binary search to work correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate.

Final: **True**
