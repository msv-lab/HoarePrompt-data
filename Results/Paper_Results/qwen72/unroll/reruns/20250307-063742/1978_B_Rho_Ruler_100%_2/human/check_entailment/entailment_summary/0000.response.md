### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `b - i + 1` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the total profit.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
     - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
     - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - This formula correctly computes the profit:
       - `k * b` is the total price if all `k` buns were sold at `b` coins each.
       - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns.
       - `+ (n - k) * a` adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

   - **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
     - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
     - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which are the valid bounds for `k`.
     - It iterates using a binary search, calculating the profit for the current `mid` and the next `mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found.
     - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it moves the search to the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it moves the search to the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
     - The function returns the maximum profit found.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is mathematically sound and matches the problem description.
   - The constraints are respected, and the functions handle the edge cases correctly (e.g., when `k = 0` or `k = min(n, b)`).

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases and their expected outputs are consistent with the problem description and the logic implemented in the functions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
