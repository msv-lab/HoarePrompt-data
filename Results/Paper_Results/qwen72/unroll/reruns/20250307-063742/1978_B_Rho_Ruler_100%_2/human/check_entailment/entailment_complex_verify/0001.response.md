### Reasoning:

#### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
- **Correctness**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented. It calculates the profit for a given `k` as follows:
  - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1)`, which is the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
  - `(n - k) * a` computes the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
  - The sum of these two values is the total profit, which is correctly returned.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
- **Binary Search Approach**: The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases). This means that the profit will increase until a certain value of `k` and then start decreasing.
- **Range Initialization**: The range `[0, min(n, b)]` is correctly initialized for `k`.
- **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is correctly calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- **Profit Calculation**: The profits `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are correctly calculated using `func_1`.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid` correctly determines whether to move the search range to the right (increase `k`) or to the left (decrease `k`).
- **Maximum Profit Tracking**: The maximum profit found during the search is correctly tracked and returned.

#### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k = 1`:
    - `profit = 1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - The program correctly returns `17`.

- **Example 2**:
  - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Optimal `k = 5`:
    - `profit = 5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
  - The program correctly returns `35`.

- **Example 3**:
  - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k = 0`:
    - `profit = 0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 100 = 100`
  - The program correctly returns `100`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate.

Final: **True**
