### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `k`, `n`, `a`, `b` where `1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9` and `0 \le k \le \min(n, b)`.
   - **Output:** The profit calculated using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - **Explanation:**
     - `k * b` calculates the total price of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which accounts for the decreasing price of the buns.
     - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - **Correctness:** The formula correctly computes the profit for a given `k` based on the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n`, `a`, `b` where `1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9`.
   - **Output:** The maximum profit value by evaluating the profit at different points within the range `[0, min(n, b)]` using `func_1`.
   - **Explanation:**
     - The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
     - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
     - The binary search loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
     - In each iteration, the middle point `mid` is calculated.
     - The profit at `mid` and `mid + 1` is computed using `func_1`.
     - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` (search in the right half).
     - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` (search in the left half).
     - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit`.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
     - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` is equal to `b`.
     - The output for the given test cases matches the expected results, confirming that the function works as intended.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.
   - The binary search in `func_2` ensures that all potential values of `k` are considered, and the maximum profit is correctly computed.
   - The program handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.
- The binary search approach in `func_2` is efficient and ensures that the optimal `k` is found.
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

Final: **True**
