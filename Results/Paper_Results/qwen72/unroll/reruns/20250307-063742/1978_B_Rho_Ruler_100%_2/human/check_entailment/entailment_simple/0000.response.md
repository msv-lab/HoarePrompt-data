### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
- **Formula**: The profit is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
  - `k * b` is the total price of the first `k` buns at the modified price.
  - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k - 1` integers, which represents the discount applied to the first `k` buns.
  - `(n - k) * a` is the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
- **Correctness**: The formula is mathematically correct and matches the problem description.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
- **Binary Search**:
  - **Initialization**: `low` and `high` are set to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
  - **Loop**: The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
  - **Mid Calculation**: `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
  - **Profit Calculation**:
    - `profit_mid` is the profit for `k = mid`.
    - `profit_next` is the profit for `k = mid + 1`.
  - **Max Profit Update**: `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
  - **Search Direction**:
    - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` might yield a higher profit, so `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
- **Correctness**:
  - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it first increases and then decreases).
  - The loop correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
  - The final `max_profit` is returned, which is the maximum profit found during the binary search.

#### Overall Program:
- The main block reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and calls `func_2(n, a, b)` to compute the maximum profit.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
