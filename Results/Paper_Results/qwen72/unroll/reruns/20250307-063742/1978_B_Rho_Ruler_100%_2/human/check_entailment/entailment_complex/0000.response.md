### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob can sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price, where the price of the \( i \)-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The goal is to maximize the total profit from selling all \( n \) buns.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - The formula used is \( k \cdot b - k \cdot (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \cdot a \).
   - \( k \cdot b \) is the sum of the prices of the first \( k \) buns if they were all sold at \( b \).
   - \( k \cdot (k - 1) // 2 \) is the sum of the first \( k - 1 \) natural numbers, which is subtracted to account for the decreasing price of the first \( k \) buns.
   - \( (n - k) \cdot a \) is the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - This function correctly computes the profit for a given \( k \).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It iterates while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and the profit for the next value `mid + 1` using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means the profit is increasing, so it moves the search to the right by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it moves the search to the left by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - This approach ensures that the function finds the maximum profit efficiently.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The binary search in `func_2` is correctly implemented to find the optimal \( k \).
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is mathematically sound and correctly reflects the problem's constraints.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem by efficiently finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling all \( n \) buns using a binary search approach and a well-defined profit calculation function.
