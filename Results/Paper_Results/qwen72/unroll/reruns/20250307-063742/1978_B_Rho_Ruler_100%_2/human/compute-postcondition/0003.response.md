Output State: **`low` is the value where the maximum profit is achieved, `high` is `low - 1`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit value.**

### Explanation:
- The loop is a binary search that aims to find the value of `mid` which maximizes the profit calculated by `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- In each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated, and the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1` is compared.
- If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, the search range is adjusted to the right half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
- If the profit at `mid + 1` is not greater than the profit at `mid`, the search range is adjusted to the left half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
- The `max_profit` variable is updated to the maximum value of `profit_mid` encountered during the loop.
- When the loop terminates, `low` will be the value where the maximum profit is achieved, and `high` will be `low - 1` because the loop exits when `low` exceeds `high`. The `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit value found.
