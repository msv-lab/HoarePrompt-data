The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It returns a single integer value calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. The purpose of the function is to compute a specific mathematical expression based on the given parameters. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the function's return value is the result of the expression.
