The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here’s the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the inputs. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints, the function likely returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` and `k` (integers for each test case), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement.**
