The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is a non-zero integer, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
