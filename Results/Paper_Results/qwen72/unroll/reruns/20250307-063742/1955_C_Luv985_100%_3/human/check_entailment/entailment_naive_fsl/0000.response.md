Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the Kraken attacks a single ship. Specifically, when `n = 1`, the program will not correctly count the number of ships sunk. Here is an example:

Input:
```
1
1 5
1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, there is only one ship with a durability of 1, and the Kraken attacks it 5 times. The ship should sink after the first attack, but the program does not account for this scenario and incorrectly outputs 0.
