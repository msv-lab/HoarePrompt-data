### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and converts them to integers.
   - It also reads the list `a` and converts each element to an integer.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `l` (left pointer) to 0 and `r` (right pointer) to `n - 1`.
   - It also initializes `ans` (the number of sunk ships) to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi`).
   - If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi` and decreases `k` by `mi * 2`.
   - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it increments `l` and increments `ans`.
   - If the last ship's durability becomes 0, it decrements `r` and increments `ans`.
   - If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, it calculates the remainder of `k` when divided by 2 (`t`).
   - It then checks if the first ship's durability can be reduced to 0 by the remaining attacks. If so, it increments `ans` and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If `l == r` (i.e., only one ship is left), it checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are enough to sink the last ship and increments `ans` if so.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- It correctly reduces the durability of the ships and updates the pointers and the number of sunk ships.
- The logic for handling the case when only one ship is left is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The program should handle cases where `k` is very large (up to \(10^{15}\)) efficiently.
- It should also handle cases where `n` is 1 correctly, which it does by the final check.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
