You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable that can convert a string to a specific type (e.g., int, float).
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element of the input string split by spaces. The `cast` function can convert a string to a specific type (e.g., int, float).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element of an input string, which is split by spaces. The `cast` function is expected to convert strings to a specific type (e.g., int, float). The final state of the program includes a map object that contains the converted elements from the input string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the largest index `l` in `arr` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`, and returns the result of calling `func_2` with `arr` and `predicate` as arguments. The final state of the program is that the return value of `func_2` is returned to the caller.

    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns `result + 1` if `func_2(arr, predicate)` returns an integer `result` that is not `None`. Otherwise, it returns `None`. The function does not modify the input `arr` or `predicate`.

    #State: `n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `inds` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function computes a cumulative XOR list `x` from `a` and a dictionary `inds` mapping each cumulative XOR value to the indices where it appears in `x`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match, and if the latter is greater than the former, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the binary search and the conditions for determining if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to perform a binary search, but they are not correctly implemented to find the appropriate indices for the XOR conditions.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

Actual Output:
The program may produce incorrect results for some of these queries due to the incorrect binary search logic.

For example, the query `(1, 5)` should return `YES` because the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` can be split into `[1, 1]` and `[2, 3, 0]` where the XOR of both parts is `0`. However, the program's binary search logic might not correctly identify this condition, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
