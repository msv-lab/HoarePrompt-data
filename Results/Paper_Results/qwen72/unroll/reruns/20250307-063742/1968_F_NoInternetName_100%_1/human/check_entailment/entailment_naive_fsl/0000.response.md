Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the binary search and the conditions for determining if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to perform a binary search, but they are not correctly implemented to find the appropriate indices for the XOR conditions.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

Actual Output:
The program may produce incorrect results for some of these queries due to the incorrect binary search logic.

For example, the query `(1, 5)` should return `YES` because the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` can be split into `[1, 1]` and `[2, 3, 0]` where the XOR of both parts is `0`. However, the program's binary search logic might not correctly identify this condition, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
