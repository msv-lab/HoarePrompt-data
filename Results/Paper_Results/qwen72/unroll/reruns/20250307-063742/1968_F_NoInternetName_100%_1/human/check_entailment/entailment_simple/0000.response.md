### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q` in the array `a`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed correctly. Each element `x[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`.
   - The `inds` dictionary is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears. This is crucial for efficiently checking if a subarray can be split into interesting parts.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting.
   - The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is interesting because it can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - The condition `if upper > lower` checks if there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` such that the subarray can be split into interesting parts.

4. **Binary Search Functions**:
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are used to perform binary search on the list of indices stored in `inds`.
   - `func_4` is a wrapper around `func_2` that adjusts the index by 1 to match the 1-based indexing used in the problem statement.
   - The binary search logic in `func_2` is correct and efficiently finds the largest index where the predicate is true.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray cannot be split into interesting parts.
   - The use of `defaultdict` ensures that even if a prefix XOR value does not appear in the array, the program can handle it gracefully.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and efficiently handles the problem requirements. It correctly constructs the prefix XOR array and uses binary search to answer the queries in an optimal manner.

Correctness: **True**
