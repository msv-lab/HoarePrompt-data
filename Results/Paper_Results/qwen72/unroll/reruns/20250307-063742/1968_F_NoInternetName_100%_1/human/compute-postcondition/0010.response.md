Functionality: ** The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function computes a cumulative XOR list `x` from `a` and a dictionary `inds` mapping each cumulative XOR value to the indices where it appears in `x`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match, and if the latter is greater than the former, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. **
