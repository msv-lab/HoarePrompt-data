Output State: **`n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `inds` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `q` times, and during each iteration, it updates `l` and `r` using the function `func_1(int)`.
- The values of `l` and `r` are used to check conditions and print 'Yes' or 'No'.
- The variables `x` and `inds` are used to look up values and indices, but they are not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n`, `q`, and `a` are not affected by the loop at all.
- Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the state of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, and `inds` remains the same as in the initial state.
