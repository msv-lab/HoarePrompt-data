### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - The program uses a prefix XOR array `x` to store the cumulative XOR of the elements in the array `a`.
   - The dictionary `inds` maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where it appears.

2. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index `l` in `arr` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are essentially wrappers around `func_2` with slight modifications:
     - `func_3` returns the result of `func_2`.
     - `func_4` returns the result of `func_2` plus 1 if the result is not `None`.

3. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - The function reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it prints "Yes" because the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into two parts with the same XOR.
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses binary search to find indices in `inds` where the XOR values match the conditions:
     - `lower` is the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
     - `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `inds`.
   - `func_2` correctly finds the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
   - `func_4` correctly returns this index plus 1 if it exists, which is used to find the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.

5. **Query Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x[l-1] == x[r]` by printing "Yes".
   - For the case where `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses the binary search to find the indices in `inds` that satisfy the conditions. If such indices exist and `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes".

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5 5
     1 1 2 3 0
     1 5
     2 4
     3 5
     1 3
     3 4
     ```
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is `[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1]`.
   - The dictionary `inds` is:
     ```
     {0: [0, 2], 1: [1, 4, 5], 2: [3]}
     ```
   - For the query `(1, 5)`, `x[0] == x[5]` is `True`, so it prints "Yes".
   - For the query `(2, 4)`, `x[1] == x[4]` is `True`, so it prints "Yes".
   - For the query `(3, 5)`, `x[2] != x[5]`, and the binary search finds `lower = 0` and `upper = 4`, but `upper <= lower`, so it prints "No".
   - For the query `(1, 3)`, `x[0] != x[3]`, and the binary search finds `lower = 0` and `upper = 3`, but `upper <= lower`, so it prints "No".
   - For the query `(3, 4)`, `x[2] != x[4]`, and the binary search finds `lower = 0` and `upper = 4`, but `upper <= lower`, so it prints "No".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the conditions for determining if a subarray is interesting. The binary search logic is appropriately implemented to find the necessary indices, and the conditions for printing "Yes" or "No" are correctly applied.

Final: **True**
