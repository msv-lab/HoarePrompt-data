The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element of an input string, which is split by spaces. The `cast` function is expected to convert strings to a specific type (e.g., int, float). The final state of the program includes a map object that contains the converted elements from the input string.
