Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing a single element 0, `inds` is an empty defaultdict of lists.** 

The code initializes `inds` as an empty defaultdict of lists, which means `inds` will automatically create a list for any new key that is accessed. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
