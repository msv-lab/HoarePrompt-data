### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` is used to read and convert input strings to the specified type (int in this case). This function is correctly implemented and returns a map object that can be converted to a list. This is a standard way to handle input in Python.

2. **Binary Search (`func_2` and `func_4`)**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index in `arr` where the predicate function returns `True`. This is a correct implementation of binary search.
   - `func_4` calls `func_2` and adjusts the result by adding 1 if the result is not `None`. This is also correctly implemented.

3. **Cumulative XOR Calculation (`func_5`)**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It computes the cumulative XOR list `x` and a dictionary `inds` that maps each cumulative XOR value to the indices where it appears in `x`.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If they are not equal, it uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match. If the latter is greater than the former, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - The query handling logic is correct. If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is zero, which implies the subarray is interesting.
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the function uses the binary search results to check if there is a valid split. The logic for finding the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by returning 'No' when the conditions are not met.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, computes the necessary cumulative XOR values, and processes the queries efficiently using binary search.

### Correctness:
**True**
