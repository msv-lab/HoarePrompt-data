You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function computes a cumulative XOR list `x` from `a` and a dictionary `inds` mapping each cumulative XOR value to the indices where it appears in `x`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match, and if the latter is greater than the former, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains an array `a` of integers and a number of queries `q`.
   - Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` representing the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, the program should determine if the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is "interesting" as defined in the problem statement.

3. **Definition of "Interesting":**
   - A subarray is "interesting" if it can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(cast)`**
   - This function reads input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - It is used to read the number of elements and queries, as well as the elements of the array.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(arr, predicate)`**
   - This function performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the largest index `mid` such that `predicate(arr[mid])` is `True`.
   - It returns the index if found, otherwise `None`.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(arr, predicate)`**
   - This function is a direct call to `func_2` with the same arguments.
   - It seems redundant but does not affect the correctness.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(arr, predicate)`**
   - This function calls `func_2` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`.
   - It is used to find the largest index `mid` such that `predicate(arr[mid])` is `True` and then return `mid + 1`.

5. **Function 5: `func_5()`**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `a`.
   - It computes the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - It stores the indices of each prefix XOR value in a dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is "interesting" by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR.
   - Otherwise, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]][lower] < l` and the largest index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]][upper] <= r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a valid split point.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly computed.
   - `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The program correctly checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` to determine if the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR.
   - For the case where `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find valid split points.
   - The binary search functions `func_2` and `func_4` are used to find the largest indices `lower` and `upper` efficiently.
   - The condition `upper > lower` correctly determines if there is a valid split point.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient and accurate results for the queries.

Correctness: **True**
