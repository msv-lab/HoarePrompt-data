Output State: **`n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `x` is a list of integers where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`, and `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from the list `x` and the value is a list of indices where this integer appears in `x`.**
