Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` reassigns the variable `a` to a list of integers returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The length of this list is `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
