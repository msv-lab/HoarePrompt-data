The function `read` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, for the problem described, the preconditions for the main function that would solve this problem would be: `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a tuple of integers `(l, r)` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
