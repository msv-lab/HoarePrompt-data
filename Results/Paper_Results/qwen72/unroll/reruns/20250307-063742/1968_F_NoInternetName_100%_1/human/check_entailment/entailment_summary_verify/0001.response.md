### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix XOR Array (`x`):**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly computed. Each element `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`. This is crucial for determining the XOR of any subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the property `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Dictionary of Indices (`inds`):**
   - The dictionary `inds` maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where it appears. This is used to efficiently find potential split points for the subarray.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If this condition is true, it means the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` can be split into two parts with the same XOR value, and the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the program uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]][lower] < l` and the smallest index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]][upper] <= r`.
   - The condition `upper > lower` is used to determine if there is a valid split point. If `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split point where the subarray can be divided into parts with the same XOR value, and the program correctly prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2` and `func_4`):**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index `mid` such that `predicate(arr[mid])` is `True`.
   - `func_4` calls `func_2` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`. This is used to find the largest index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]][lower] < l`.
   - `func_3` is a direct call to `func_2` and is used to find the largest index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]][upper] <= r`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is built correctly using the cumulative XOR of elements in `a`.
  - `x[0]` is initialized to 0, and `x[i]` is computed as `x[i-1] ^ a[i-1]`.

- **Dictionary Construction:**
  - The dictionary `inds` is constructed correctly. Each prefix XOR value is mapped to a list of indices where it appears in `x`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query `(l, r)`, the program first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. This is a valid check because if the prefix XORs are the same, the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
  - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the program uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]][lower] < l` and the smallest index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]][upper] <= r`.
  - The condition `upper > lower` is used to determine if there is a valid split point. This is correct because if `upper > lower`, it means there is an index `i` in the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` where the prefix XORs match, allowing the subarray to be split into parts with the same XOR value.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient and accurate results for the queries.

Final: **True**
