Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k`, and `func_2` uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. The binary search ensures that the program efficiently finds the maximum profit by comparing the profit at the current `k` and the next `k`. The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 or when `n` is very large. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
