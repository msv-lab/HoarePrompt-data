The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. The loop condition is `low <= high`. For the loop to execute the first time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9
- `low` is 0
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`
- `max_profit` is 0

Since `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, `high` will always be at least 1. Therefore, the condition `low <= high` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
