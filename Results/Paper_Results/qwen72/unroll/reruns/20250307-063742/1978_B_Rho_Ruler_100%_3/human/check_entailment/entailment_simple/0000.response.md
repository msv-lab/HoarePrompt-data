Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

### Function Analysis:
1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit based on the value of `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - `k * b` calculates the total price of the first `k` buns at the modified price.
   - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price of the buns in the promotion.
   - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - This function is correct and accurately computes the profit for a given `k`.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The range for `k` is set from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - The binary search iterates, comparing the profit at the current midpoint `mid` with the profit at `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means increasing `k` further might yield a higher profit, so the search continues in the upper half.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is not greater than the profit at `mid`, the search continues in the lower half.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit` and returned.

### Correctness:
- The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases).
- The constraints are handled correctly, and the program ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
- The program correctly computes the profit for each `k` and updates the maximum profit accordingly.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case `4 4 5`:
  - `k = 0`: Profit = `4 * 4 = 16`
  - `k = 1`: Profit = `5 + 3 * 4 = 17`
  - `k = 2`: Profit = `5 + 4 + 2 * 4 = 17`
  - `k = 3`: Profit = `5 + 4 + 3 + 1 * 4 = 16`
  - `k = 4`: Profit = `5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14`
  - The maximum profit is `17`, which is correct.

- For the test case `5 5 9`:
  - `k = 0`: Profit = `5 * 5 = 25`
  - `k = 1`: Profit = `9 + 4 * 5 = 29`
  - `k = 2`: Profit = `9 + 8 + 3 * 5 = 32`
  - `k = 3`: Profit = `9 + 8 + 7 + 2 * 5 = 35`
  - `k = 4`: Profit = `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 1 * 5 = 35`
  - `k = 5`: Profit = `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`
  - The maximum profit is `35`, which is correct.

- For the test case `10 10 5`:
  - `k = 0`: Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - `k = 1`: Profit = `5 + 9 * 10 = 95`
  - `k = 2`: Profit = `5 + 4 + 8 * 10 = 89`
  - The maximum profit is `100`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the binary search to find the optimal `k` for maximizing profit. The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
