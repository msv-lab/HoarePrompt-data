Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, considering the special pricing for the first k buns. The solution is divided into two main functions:

1. **func_1(k, n, a, b)**: This function calculates the profit for a given value of k, where k is the number of buns sold at the modified price. The profit is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
   \]
   This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first k modified prices and the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

2. **func_2(n, a, b)**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. The binary search is performed over the range [0, min(n, b)], which is the valid range for k. The function compares the profit at the midpoint (mid) and the next midpoint (mid + 1) to decide whether to search in the lower or upper half of the range. The maximum profit found during the search is stored in the variable `max_profit`.

The binary search approach is efficient and ensures that the optimal k is found within the constraints. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 0 or when k is equal to the minimum of n and b.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
