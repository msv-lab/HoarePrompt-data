### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of the modified prices: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - This formula is correct because it sums the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - This formula is also correct.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`**
   - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for `k` is from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
     - This range is correct because `k` cannot be greater than `n` or `b`.
   - It initializes `max_profit` to 0.
   - It performs a binary search:
     - For each `mid` value, it calculates the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` to the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
     - If `profit_next` (profit for `k = mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could lead to a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point the optimal `k` has been found, and `max_profit` is returned.
     - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a maximum and then decreases).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns.
     - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining buns.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts, which is correct.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal.
     - The search range `0` to `min(n, b)` is correct.
     - The loop correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
     - The `max_profit` is updated correctly to ensure the maximum profit is found.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n = 1`, the function should return `b` if `b > a`, otherwise `a`.
     - This is correctly handled by the binary search, as it will either choose `k = 0` or `k = 1` based on the comparison.
   - When `b = 1`, the function should return `n * a` because selling at the modified price would not be beneficial.
     - This is correctly handled by the binary search, as the modified price will always be less than or equal to `a`.
   - When `a = b`, the function should return `n * a` because the modified price is the same as the usual price.
     - This is correctly handled by the binary search, as the profit will be the same for all `k`.
