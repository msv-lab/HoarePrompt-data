The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (each between 1 and 10^9) and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved. The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value within the range [0, min(n, b)], and the final state of the program is such that the variable `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found.
