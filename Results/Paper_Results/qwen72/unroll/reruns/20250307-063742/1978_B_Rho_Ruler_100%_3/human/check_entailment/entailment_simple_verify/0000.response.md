### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the total profit.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - `k * b` calculates the total price if all `k` buns were sold at the initial modified price `b`.
   - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun in the modified price range.
   - `+ (n - k) * a` adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The function correctly computes the profit for a given `k` and adheres to the constraints.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively, which are the valid bounds for `k`.
   - The binary search loop continues while `low <= high`.
   - `mid` is the middle point of the current range.
   - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are calculated using `func_1` for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1` respectively.
   - `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` further might yield a higher profit, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to explore smaller values of `k`.
   - The loop ensures that the optimal `k` is found by narrowing down the range and comparing profits.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`, which is correctly handled by the formula.
   - When `n` is very large, the binary search efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` without iterating through all possible values.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`, the optimal `k` is `1`, and the profit is `5 + 4 * 3 = 17`.
   - For `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`, the optimal `k` is `5`, and the profit is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.
   - For `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`, the optimal `k` is `0`, and the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.
   - These examples are correctly handled by the program.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns. The binary search ensures efficient computation, and the program handles all edge cases and constraints as described.

Final: **True**
