You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (each between 1 and 10^9) and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved. The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value within the range [0, min(n, b)], and the final state of the program is such that the variable `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of the modified prices: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`**
   - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for `k` is from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It initializes `max_profit` to 0.
   - It performs a binary search:
     - For each `mid` value, it calculates the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` to the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
     - If `profit_next` (profit for `k = mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could lead to a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point the optimal `k` has been found, and `max_profit` is returned.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns.
     - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining buns.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts, which is correct.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal `k` because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a maximum and then decreases).
     - The search range `0` to `min(n, b)` is correct because `k` cannot be greater than `n` or `b`.
     - The loop correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
     - The `max_profit` is updated correctly to ensure the maximum profit is found.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n = 1`, the function should return `b` if `b > a`, otherwise `a`.
   - When `b = 1`, the function should return `n * a` because selling at the modified price would not be beneficial.
   - When `a = b`, the function should return `n * a` because the modified price is the same as the usual price.
   - All these edge cases are handled correctly by the given functions.

The given program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.
