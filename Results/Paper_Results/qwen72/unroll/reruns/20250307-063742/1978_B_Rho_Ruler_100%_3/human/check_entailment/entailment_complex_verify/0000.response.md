### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Constraints**: The function `func_1` takes four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` where \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b)\) and \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\).
   - **Expression**: The function calculates the profit using the formula \(k \cdot b - k \cdot (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \cdot a\).
     - \(k \cdot b\) is the total price of the first \(k\) buns sold at the modified price.
     - \(k \cdot (k - 1) // 2\) is the sum of the first \(k - 1\) integers, which represents the discount applied to the modified prices.
     - \((n - k) \cdot a\) is the total price of the remaining \(n - k\) buns sold at the usual price.
   - **Output**: The function returns the calculated profit, which is a non-negative integer.

2. **Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Constraints**: The function `func_2` takes three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\).
   - **Binary Search**:
     - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
     - It uses a binary search to find the optimal value of \(k\) that maximizes the profit.
     - In each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current \(k\) (`mid`) and the next \(k\) (`mid + 1`).
     - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.
     - It keeps track of the maximum profit found using the `max_profit` variable.
   - **Output**: The function returns the maximum profit found.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The main program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - **Function Calls**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and calls `func_2` to determine the maximum profit.
   - **Output**: It prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct and accurately calculates the profit for a given \(k\).
  - The function handles the constraints and edge cases correctly.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the optimal \(k\) that maximizes the profit.
  - The comparison between `profit_mid` and `profit_next` ensures that the search converges to the optimal \(k\).
  - The function correctly updates the `low` and `high` bounds based on the comparison results.
  - The `max_profit` variable is updated to keep track of the highest profit found during the search.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - When \(k = 0\), the function `func_1` correctly returns the profit as \(n \cdot a\).
  - When \(n\) is very large, the binary search ensures that the function efficiently finds the optimal \(k\) without iterating through all possible values.

- **Example Verification**:
  - For the test case \(n = 4\), \(a = 4\), \(b = 5\):
    - The optimal \(k\) is 1, and the profit is \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17\).
  - For the test case \(n = 5\), \(a = 5\), \(b = 9\):
    - The optimal \(k\) is 5, and the profit is \(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\).
  - For the test case \(n = 10\), \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\):
    - The optimal \(k\) is 0, and the profit is \(10 \cdot 10 = 100\).

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, and it handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
