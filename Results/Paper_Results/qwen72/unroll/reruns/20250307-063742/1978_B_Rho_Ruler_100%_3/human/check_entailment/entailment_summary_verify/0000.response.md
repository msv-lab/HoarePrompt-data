### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
   - **Formula**: The profit is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `k * b` is the total price of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which represents the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - **Correctness**: The formula is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function uses a binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - **Binary Search**:
     - The search range is `[0, min(n, b)]`, which is correct as `k` can be any value from 0 to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
     - The function initializes `max_profit` to 0 and iterates using a binary search approach.
     - In each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current `mid` value and the next `mid + 1` value.
     - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` might lead to a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
     - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The binary search approach is efficient and appropriate for finding the optimal `k`.
     - The function correctly handles the edge cases:
       - When `k = 0`, it sells all buns at the usual price.
       - When `k = min(n, b)`, it sells the maximum possible buns at the modified price.
     - The function ensures that the maximum profit is found by comparing the profit at the current `k` and the next `k`.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
     - Optimal `k = 1`: Profit = `1 * 5 - 1 * 0 // 2 + 3 * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
     - The program correctly outputs 17.
   - **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Optimal `k = 5`: Profit = `5 * 9 - 5 * 4 // 2 + 0 * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`
     - The program correctly outputs 35.
   - **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
     - Optimal `k = 0`: Profit = `0 * 5 - 0 * 0 // 2 + 10 * 10 = 100`
     - The program correctly outputs 100.
   - **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Optimal `k = 5`: Profit = `5 * 11 - 5 * 4 // 2 + 0 * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
     - The program correctly outputs 45.
   - **Example 5**: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
     - Optimal `k = 0`: Profit = `0 * 10^9 - 0 * 0 // 2 + 10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
     - The program correctly outputs `10^18`.
   - **Example 6**: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
     - Optimal `k = 0`: Profit = `0 * 1 - 0 * 0 // 2 + 10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
     - The program correctly outputs `10^18`.
   - **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
     - Optimal `k = 1000`: Profit = `1000 * 1000 - 1000 * 999 // 2 + 0 * 1 = 1000000 - 499500 = 500500`
     - The program correctly outputs 500500.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is correct and efficiently finds the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found, and the function `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

Final: **True**
