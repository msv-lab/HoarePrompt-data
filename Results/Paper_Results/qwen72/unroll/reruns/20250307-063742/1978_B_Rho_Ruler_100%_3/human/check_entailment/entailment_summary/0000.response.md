### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `b - i + 1` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - `k * b` is the total price of the first `k` buns if sold at the modified price.
   - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the discount applied to the modified prices.
   - `(n - k) * a` is the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - This function is correct as it accurately calculates the profit for a given `k`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which are the valid ranges for `k`.
   - It iterates using a binary search, calculating the profit for the current `mid` value and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means we should explore the higher values of `k`, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it means the current `mid` or lower values are better, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit` and returned.

4. **Main Program:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calls `func_2` with these values and prints the result.
   - This approach is correct as it processes each test case independently and uses the binary search to find the optimal `k` for each case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns with the given constraints. The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
