Output State: **`low` is the smallest integer such that `profit` does not increase anymore, `high` is `low - 1`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit found.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop performs a binary search to find the optimal value of `mid` that maximizes the profit.
- `low` will end up being the smallest value where the profit does not increase anymore when `mid` is incremented.
- `high` will be one less than `low` because the loop stops when `low` exceeds `high`.
- `max_profit` will be the highest profit value found during the loop execution.
