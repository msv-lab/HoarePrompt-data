The only object in the loop head is the `trumps` list. For the loop to execute, the `trumps` list must not be empty. According to the state right before the loop, the `trumps` list is sorted in descending order, but it is not specified whether it contains any elements. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `trumps` contains at least one element.

State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and contains at least one element. The `answers` list will contain all the resolved pairs of cards. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared.**
