Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit but no higher-ranked non-trump card to beat the lower-ranked one. For example, if the input is:

```
1
3
S
3C 2C 4C
```

The program will output:
```
3C 4C
IMPOSSIBLE
```

However, a valid output could be:
```
2C 3C
4C 3C
```

The program fails to consider that a lower-ranked non-trump card can be beaten by a higher-ranked non-trump card, and it incorrectly concludes that the game is impossible when it is not.
