The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and 16, inclusive, representing the number of rounds. `trump_suit` is a character that can be one of 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S', representing the trump suit. `cards` is a list of 2n unique strings, where each string represents a card in the format of a rank (one of '23456789') followed by a suit (one of 'CDHS').

The function returns the result of a card game based on the provided parameters. However, the specific return values are not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general notion that the function returns a result based on the card game rules.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards` (each string in the format of a rank followed by a suit). It returns the result of a card game based on these inputs.**
