You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string represents a card in the format of a rank (one of '23456789') followed by a suit (one of 'CDHS'). All cards in the list are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The `trumps` list will contain the ranks of all cards that match the `trump` suit. The `answers` list will contain strings representing the pairs of cards that were compared and resolved in the loop, formatted as 'rank1 suit rank2 suit'. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will have the rank of the last unmatched card.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, the `trumps` list will be empty if all elements were popped.
    #   - The `answers` list will contain all the resolved pairs of cards.
    #   - The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared.
    #
    #Given this, the output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list remains unchanged. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list remains unchanged. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `answers` list to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards` (each string in the format of a rank followed by a suit). It returns the result of a card game based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
