Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings `cards`, where each string represents a card in the format of a rank (one of '23456789') followed by a suit (one of 'CDHS'). All cards in the list are unique. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of an input character, but the specific value is unknown.**
