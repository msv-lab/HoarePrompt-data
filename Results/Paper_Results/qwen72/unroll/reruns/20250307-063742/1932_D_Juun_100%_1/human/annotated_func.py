#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string represents a card in the format of a rank (one of '23456789') followed by a suit (one of 'CDHS'). All cards in the list are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The `trumps` list will contain the ranks of all cards that match the `trump` suit. The `answers` list will contain strings representing the pairs of cards that were compared and resolved in the loop, formatted as 'rank1 suit rank2 suit'. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will have the rank of the last unmatched card.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, the `trumps` list will be empty if all elements were popped.
    #   - The `answers` list will contain all the resolved pairs of cards.
    #   - The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared.
    #
    #Given this, the output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list remains unchanged. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list remains unchanged. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `answers` list to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a card game scenario where it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards` (each string in the format of a rank followed by a suit). It reads the inputs, identifies the trump cards, and pairs non-trump cards of the same suit. If there are remaining trump cards, it pairs them with the last unmatched non-trump cards. If it's impossible to pair all cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. Otherwise, it prints the paired cards, ensuring that any remaining trump cards are printed in descending order of their ranks. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the `trumps` list is empty, the `answers` list contains all the resolved pairs of cards, and the `suits` dictionary has `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared.
