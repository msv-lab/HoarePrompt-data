Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings `cards`, where each string represents a card in the format of a rank (one of '23456789') followed by a suit (one of 'CDHS'). All cards in the list are unique. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of an input character, but the specific value is unknown. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and all values are `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
