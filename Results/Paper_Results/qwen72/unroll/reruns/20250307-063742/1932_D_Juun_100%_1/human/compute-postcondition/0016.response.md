Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a card game scenario where it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards` (each string in the format of a rank followed by a suit). It reads the inputs, identifies the trump cards, and pairs non-trump cards of the same suit. If there are remaining trump cards, it pairs them with the last unmatched non-trump cards. If it's impossible to pair all cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. Otherwise, it prints the paired cards, ensuring that any remaining trump cards are printed in descending order of their ranks. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the `trumps` list is empty, the `answers` list contains all the resolved pairs of cards, and the `suits` dictionary has `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared. **
