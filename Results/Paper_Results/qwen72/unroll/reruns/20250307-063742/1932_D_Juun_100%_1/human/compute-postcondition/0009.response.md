Output State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order. The `answers` list will contain all the resolved pairs of cards. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a card compared and resolved, and the remaining suits will still have their original ranks if they were not compared.**

Explanation: The `trumps` list is sorted in reverse order, meaning the elements are now in descending order. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states as described in the precondition.
