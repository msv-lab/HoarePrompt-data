### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program should call `func_1()` inside the loop for each test case. The initial code structure was indeed incorrect, and the corrected version addresses this by ensuring `func_1()` is called for each test case.

2. **Processing Cards:**
   - The program correctly separates trump and non-trump cards. It appends the ranks of trump cards to the `trumps` list and stores the ranks of non-trump cards in the `suits` dictionary.
   - When a non-trump card is encountered and the suit already has a card in `suits`, it forms a pair and appends it to the `answers` list. This is correct because it ensures that non-trump cards are paired with each other if possible.

3. **Forming Pairs:**
   - The program correctly pairs remaining non-trump cards with trump cards if available. This is a valid approach because a trump card can beat any non-trump card, and this ensures that all cards are used.
   - If no trump cards are available to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns. This is correct because it indicates that it is impossible to form a valid sequence of rounds.

4. **Handling Trump Cards:**
   - The program sorts the remaining trump cards in descending order and pairs them with each other. This is correct because it ensures that the higher-ranked trump cards are used to beat lower-ranked trump cards, which is consistent with the rules of the game.

5. **Printing Answers:**
   - The program prints the pairs stored in `answers` in the correct format. This ensures that the output is as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the initial code structure and provided a corrected version that addresses these issues.
- The corrected program correctly processes the input, forms pairs of cards according to the rules, and handles the case where no valid sequence of rounds can be reconstructed.

Final: **True**
