Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input values for `x` are such that the constructed array `a` does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 % a_3 = 1`

However, the program constructs the array `a` as follows:
- `a_1 = 1000`
- `a_2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
- `a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
- `a_4 = 1006 + 1 = 1007`

This results in:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1002 % 1000 = 2` (correct)
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1006 % 1002 = 4` (correct)
- `a_4 % a_3 = 1007 % 1006 = 1` (correct)

While this specific example works, the program does not handle the case where `x_i` is greater than `a_{i-1}`. For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 501
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 501`

However, the program constructs the array `a` as follows:
- `a_1 = 1000`
- `a_2 = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
- `a_3 = 1001 + 501 = 1502`

This results in:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1001 % 1000 = 1` (correct)
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1502 % 1001 = 501` (correct)

But the problem description states that `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`, so `x_3 = 501` is not a valid input. The program should handle this edge case and ensure that the constructed array `a` satisfies the conditions for all valid inputs. The current implementation does not handle this edge case correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
