Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, the list `a` has been updated to contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` starting from 1000, and the result has been printed as a space-separated string.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the list `T`.
- It then reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers `T`.
- The list `a` is initialized with a single element, 1000.
- The loop then appends to `a` the cumulative sum of the elements in `T`, starting from the first element.
- After processing all elements, the list `a` is converted to a space-separated string and printed.
- The loop continues until all `t` test cases are processed, at which point `t` becomes 0.
