The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `x`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `x` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list represents the elements x_2, x_3, ..., x_n for a given test case. Each element x_i in these inner lists is an integer in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and the length of each inner list is n-1, with n constrained to the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and produces a corresponding output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `x` where each inner list contains integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n for a given test case. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of the elements in the inner lists.**
