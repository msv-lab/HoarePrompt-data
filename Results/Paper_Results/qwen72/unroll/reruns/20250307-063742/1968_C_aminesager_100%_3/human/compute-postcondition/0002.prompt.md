Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `x` where each inner list represents the elements `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` for a given test case. The value of `t` is now an input integer, and the length of each inner list is `n-1` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
