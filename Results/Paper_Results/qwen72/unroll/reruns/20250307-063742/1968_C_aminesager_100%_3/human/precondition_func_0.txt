The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists x where each inner list represents the elements x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) for a given test case, and the length of each inner list is n-1 (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
