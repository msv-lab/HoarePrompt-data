Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of integers `T` of length `n-1`. It then computes a new list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` starting from 1000. The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. **
