Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `x` where each inner list represents the elements `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` for a given test case. The value of `t` is now an input integer, and the length of each inner list is `n-1` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
