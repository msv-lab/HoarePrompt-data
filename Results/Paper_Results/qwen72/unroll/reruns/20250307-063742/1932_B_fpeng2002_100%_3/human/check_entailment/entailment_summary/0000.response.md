Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in sequence. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The key logic in the program is the loop that iterates over the periodicities of the signs and updates the `start_year` to the smallest year that is a multiple of the current periodicity and is greater than or equal to the previous `start_year`. This is done using the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Let's break down the logic:
1. `start_year // nums[x]` gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x]` is less than or equal to `start_year`.
2. `start_year // nums[x] + 1` gives the next integer `k+1`.
3. `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

This logic ensures that the signs occur in sequence, as required by the problem statement.

The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the logic for calculating the year in which the n-th sign occurs is correct.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
