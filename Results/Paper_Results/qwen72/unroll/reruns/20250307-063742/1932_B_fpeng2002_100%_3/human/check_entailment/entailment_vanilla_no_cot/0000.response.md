Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting year.
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
     This formula ensures that the `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the last sign will occur.

The logic correctly ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and the final year is the year in which the last sign occurs, as required by the problem statement.

Here is a breakdown of the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Signs: 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - After first sign: `start_year` = 3
  - After second sign: `start_year` = 4
  - After third sign: `start_year` = 8
  - After fourth sign: `start_year` = 10
  - After fifth sign: `start_year` = 18
  - After sixth sign: `start_year` = 36

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Signs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - After first sign: `start_year` = 1
  - After second sign: `start_year` = 2
  - After third sign: `start_year` = 3
  - After fourth sign: `start_year` = 4
  - After fifth sign: `start_year` = 5

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Signs: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - After first sign: `start_year` = 1
  - After second sign: `start_year` = 2
  - After third sign: `start_year` = 3
  - After fourth sign: `start_year` = 4
  - After fifth sign: `start_year` = 5

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Signs: 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - After first sign: `start_year` = 50
  - After second sign: `start_year` = 60
  - After third sign: `start_year` = 2133
  - After fourth sign: `start_year` = 2200
  - After fifth sign: `start_year` = 2503
  - After sixth sign: `start_year` = 2012

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
