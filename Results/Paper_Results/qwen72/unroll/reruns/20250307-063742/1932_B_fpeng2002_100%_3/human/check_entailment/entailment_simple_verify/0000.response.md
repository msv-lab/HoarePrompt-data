Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. The line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is indeed intended to find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year, but it does not correctly account for the strict requirement that the next sign must occur strictly after the previous sign.

Let's break down the logic of the program and the issue:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year for the first sign.

2. **Loop through signs**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year`.
   - The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

3. **Strict waiting requirement**:
   - According to the problem, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign starting from year `x + 1`.
   - The current implementation does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. Instead, it finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`, which can be equal to `start_year` if `start_year` is already a multiple of `nums[x]`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 4
  ```
  - The first sign occurs in the 2nd year.
  - The second sign should occur strictly after the 2nd year, but the program calculates the next multiple of 3 starting from 2, which is 3. This is incorrect because the second sign should occur in the 6th year.
  - The third sign should occur strictly after the 6th year, but the program calculates the next multiple of 4 starting from 6, which is 8. This is incorrect because the third sign should occur in the 12th year.

The correct approach would be to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign by adding 1 to `start_year` before performing the calculation:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

This ensures that the next sign occurs in the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

Given this reasoning, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
