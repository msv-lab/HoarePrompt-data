The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in `nums` and prints this year. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `num_tests` set to 0.
