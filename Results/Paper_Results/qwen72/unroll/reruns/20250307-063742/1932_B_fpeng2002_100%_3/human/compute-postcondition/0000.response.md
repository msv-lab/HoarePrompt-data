The value of `num_tests` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for each i in the range 1 to n, `num_tests` is an input integer.**
