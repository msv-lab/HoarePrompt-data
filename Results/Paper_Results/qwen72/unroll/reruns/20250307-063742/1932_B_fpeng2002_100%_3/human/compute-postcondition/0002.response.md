Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `nums` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for each i in the range 1 to n, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the largest number in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the largest multiple of the smallest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to the initial `start_year`.**

### Explanation:
- **`num_tests`**: The loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration and continues until `num_tests` is 0. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `num_tests` will be 0.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is read from input in each iteration of the loop, and it remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- **`nums`**: The list `nums` is populated with `n` integers from input in each iteration, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- **`start_year`**: The variable `start_year` is updated in each iteration of the inner loop. It is set to the smallest multiple of the current `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current value of `start_year`. This process ensures that `start_year` is aligned to the smallest multiple of the largest number in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the largest multiple of the smallest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to the initial `start_year`.

In summary, after the loop finishes, `num_tests` will be 0, `n` and `nums` will retain their values from the last iteration, and `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the largest number in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the largest multiple of the smallest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to the initial `start_year`.
