Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur with a periodicity that does not align with the sequential waiting requirement. Specifically, the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year, but it does not correctly account for the fact that the next sign should occur strictly after the previous sign.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The expected output is 12, because:
- The first sign occurs in the 2nd year.
- The second sign occurs in the 3rd year, and the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the second sign, which is in the 6th year.
- The third sign occurs in the 8th year, and the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the third sign, which is in the 12th year.

However, the program will output 8, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the strict waiting requirement after the previous sign has occurred.
